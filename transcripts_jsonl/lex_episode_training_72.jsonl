So why are we messing with this? It's not our job to change that regime, and we should be making friends with the Russians. We shouldn't be treating him as an enemy. Now we've pushed him into the camp with China. That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, candidate for the President of the United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer and author who has challenged some of the world's most powerful corporations seeking to hold them accountable for the harm they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me the most beautiful and powerful in the history of human civilization. Science is our journey, our fight for uncovering the laws of nature and leveraging them to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world. Some of the greatest human beings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannot flourish without epistemic humility, without debate, both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square, in good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, I believe Robert's voice should be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he says without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial topics like the pandemic is equally, if not more dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr, his arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation, that people read and listen to Vincent Racaniello from This Week in Virology, Dan Wilson from Debunk The Funk, and the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it and to learn from it. This is The Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's the 4th of July, Independence Day. So simple question, simple, big question. What do you love about this country, the United States of America?<|eot_id|>"}

And I know my family, when my family came over, all of my grandparents came over in 1848 during the potato famine, and they saw this country as unique in history is something that was part of a broader spiritual mission. And so I'd say that from a 30,000-foot level, I grew up so proud of this country and believing that it was the greatest country in the world, and for those reasons.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I immigrated to this country.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To me, freedom does not mean chaos, and it does not mean anarchy.

What it means is the capacity for human beings to exercise and to fulfill their creative energies unrestrained as much as possible by government.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this point that Hunter S.

They gave their lives, they gave their livelihoods, they gave their status, they gave their property, and they put it all on the line to give us our Bill of Rights and that, but those Bill of Rights, the moment that we signed them, there were forces within our society that began trying to chip away at them, and that happens in every generation. And it is the obligation of every generation to safeguard and protect those freedoms.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The blood of each generation. You mentioned your interest, your admiration of Al Albert Camus, of Stoicism, perhaps your interest in existentialism.

He took his duty, he embraced the task and the absurdity of life, and he pushed the stone up the hill. And that if we do that, and if we find ways of being service to others, that is the ultimate, that's the key to the lock, that's the solution to the puzzle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Each individual person in that way can rebel against absurdity by discovering meaning to this whole messy thing.<|eot_id|>"}

There's a lot of different ways to read that book, but one of them, especially given how it was written, is that The Plague symbolizes Nazi Germany and the Hitler regime.

And then he also had the moral courage. So my father, to get back to your question, famously said that, \"Moral courage is the most important quality and it's more rare,\" and courage on the football field or courage in battle than physical courage. It's much more difficult to come by, but it's the most important quality in a human being.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you think that kind of empathy that you referred to, that requires moral courage?<|eot_id|>"}

I saw Lindsey Graham on TV saying something to the extent of, \"Anything we can do to kill Russians is a good use of our money.\" It is not. Those are somebody's children.

And nobody in the Russian military, the oligarchy, the political system, nobody supported it. But we're being told, \"Oh yeah, it's the beginning of the end for Putin. He's weakened. He's wounded.

I think Ukrainians are very lucky to fight to the end. And the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody... This was a year ago in August with Kherson. Everybody was proud to fight and die for their country.

So I don't know what you call that other than saying that's a criminal enterprise.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, is it possible, within a capitalist system, to produce medication, to produce drugs at scale in a way that is not corrupt?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not corrupted by entanglements, financial entanglements with the industry. And we've set this up. The way that the system is set up today has created this system of regulatory capture on steroids. So almost 50% of FDA's budget comes from pharmaceutical companies. The people who work at FDA are, their salaries are coming from pharma, half their salaries. So they know who their bosses are. And that means getting those drugs done, getting them out the door and approved as quickly as possible. It's called fast track approval. 50% of FDA's budget, about 45%, actually goes to fast track approval.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think money can buy integrity?<|eot_id|>"}

I'm talking about population wide, I'm not talking about the individual.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I'd like to believe that in general, a career of a scientist is not a very high paying job. I'd like to believe that people that go into science, that work at FDA, that work at NIH are doing it for a reason that's not even correlated with money, really.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>their boats, it's paying for their mortgages, it's paying for their children's education. And you have to expect that in those kind of situations, the regulatory function would be subsumed beneath the mercantile ambitions of the agency itself and the individuals who stand to profit enormously from getting a drug to market. Those guys are paid by us, the taxpayer, to find problems with those drugs before they get to market. But if you know that drug is going to pay for your mortgage, you may overlook a little problem or even a very big one. And that's the problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've talked about that the media slanders you by calling you an anti-vaxxer, and you've said that you're not anti-vaccine, you're pro safe vaccine. Difficult question, can you name any vaccines that you think are good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is safe and effective. In fact-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those are big words.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Those are big words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the polio? Let's start with the-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>around the world to induce tumors and rats and Guinea pigs in labs. But it was in that vaccine, 98 million people who got that vaccine. And my generation got it. And now you've had this explosion of soft tissue cancers in our generation that killed many, many, many more people than polio ever did. So if you say to me, \"The polio vaccine, was it effective against polio?\" I'm going to say, \"Yes.\" And if say to me, \"Did it cause more death than avert?\" I would say, \"I don't know, because we don't have the data on that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But let's talk. We have to narrow in on what is it effective against the thing it's supposed to fight?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dying of anemia, bilharzia, malaria, sepsis, and mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease, pneumonia. Mainly pulmonary and respiratory disease, pneumonia. And it turns out that this is what research has found who were all pro-vaccine, by the way. They said that this vaccine is killing more children and than did their attendance and protected prior to the introduction of the vaccine and for 30 years nobody ever noticed it. The vaccine was providing protection against those target illnesses, but it had ruined the children's immune systems. And they could not defend themselves against random infections that were harmless to most children.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But isn't it nearly impossible to prove that link?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are not done for any other vaccines. So for every other medicine, in order to get approval from the FDA, you have to do a placebo controlled trial prior to licensure, where you look at health outcomes among an exposed group, a group that gets it and compare those to a similarly situated group that gets placebo. The only medical intervention that does not receive, that does not undergo placebo controlled trials prior to licensure are vaccines. Not one of the 72 vaccines that are now mandated for our children have ever undergone a placebo controlled trial prior to licensure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I should say on that point, I've heard from a bunch of folks that disagree with you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Including polio. I mean, the testing is a really important point. Before licensure, placebo controlled randomized trials, polio received just that against the saline placebo control. So I'm confused why you say that they don't go through that process. It seems like a lot of them do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Just for any vaccines, send me one. Any of the 72 vaccines,\" He never did. So we sued the HHS and after a year of stonewalling us, HHS came back and they gave us a letter saying we have no pre-licensing safety trial for any of the 72 vaccines. And that the letter from HHS, which settled our lawsuit against them because we had a FOIA lawsuit against them, is posted on CHD's website. So anybody can go look at it. So if HHS had any study, I assume they would've given it to us and they can't find one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let me zoom out because a lot of the details matter here, pre-licensure, what does placebo controlled mean? So this probably requires a rigorous analysis. And actually, at this point, it would be nice for me just to give the shout-out to other people much smarter than me that people should follow along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, use their mind, learn and think. So one really awesome creator, I really recommend him is Dr. Dan Wilson. He hosts the Debunk the Funk Podcast. Vincent Racaniello, who hosts This Week in Virology. Brilliant guy, I've had him on the podcast. Somebody you've been battling with is Paul Offit, interesting Twitter, interesting books. People should, understand and read your books as well. And Eric Topol has a good Twitter and good books. And even Peter Hotez, I'll ask you about him.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And people should, because Paul Offit published a substack recently debunking, I think my discussion with Joe Rogan. And we have published a debunk of his debunking. So if you read his stuff, you should read-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Read both.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, you should read... And I would love to debate any of these guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Joe Rogan proposed just such a debate, which is quite fascinating to see how much attention and how much funding it garnered the debate between you and Peter Hotez. Why do you think Peter rejected the offer?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>science and he could never come back with science. He could never come back with publications. He would give publications that had nothing to do with, for example, thimerosal and vaccines, mercury based vaccines. He sent me one time, 16 studies to rebut something I'd said about thimerosal. And not one of those studies, they were all about the MMR vaccine, which doesn't contain thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real debate where you're using reason and isolating points and having a rational discourse. I don't blame him for not debating me because I don't think he has the science.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are there aspects of all the work you've done on vaccines, all the advocacy you've done, that you found out that you were not correct on, that you were wrong on, that you've changed your mind on?<|eot_id|>"}

Of course, human beings make mistakes. My book is 230 or 40, 50,000 words. There's going to be a mistake in there. But you know what I say at the beginning of the book, \"If you see a mistake in here, please notify me. I give away that people can notify me.\" And if somebody points out a mistake, I'm going to change it. I'm not going to dig my feet in and say, \"I'm not going to acknowledge this.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So some of the things we've been talking about, you've been an outspoken contrarian on some very controversial topics. This has garnered some fame and recognition in part for being attacked and standing strong against those attacks. If I may say, for being a martyr, do you worry about this drug of martyrdom that might cloud your judgment?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be a martyr or a hero or anything else. I'm doing what I think is right because I want to be peaceful inside of myself, but the only guard I have is fact-based reality. If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong, for example, if you come back and say, \"Look, Bobby, here's a safety study on polio that was done pre-licensure and used a real saline solution.\" I'm going to put that on my Twitter and I'm going to say, \"I was wrong, there is one out there.\" But that's all I can do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right.

But I take a ton of vitamins and nutrients, I'm on an anti-aging protocol from my doctor that includes testosterone replacement. But I don't take any anabolic steroids or anything like that. And the DRT I use is bioidentical to what my body produced.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are your thoughts on hormone therapy in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I talk to a lot of doctors about that stuff because I'm interested in health and I've heard really good things about it, but I'm definitely not an expert on it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>About God. You wrote, \"God talks to human beings through many vectors, wise people, organized religion, the great books of religions, through art, music and poetry.

And then all of a sudden, it was lifted effortlessly. So I saw that early evidence of God in my life and of the power, and I see it now every day of my life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So adding that moral dimension to all of your actions is how you were able to win that Kambu battle against the absurd.<|eot_id|>"}
