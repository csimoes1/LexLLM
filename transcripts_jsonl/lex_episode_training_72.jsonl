{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's not a good thing for our country. And by the way, what we're doing now does not appear to be weakening Putin at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr, candidate for the President of the United States, running as a Democrat. Robert is an activist, lawyer and author who has challenged some of the world's most powerful corporations seeking to hold them accountable for the harm they may cause. I love science and engineering. These two pursuits are, to me the most beautiful and powerful in the history of human civilization. Science is our journey, our fight for uncovering the laws of nature and leveraging them to understand the universe and to lessen the amount of suffering in the world. Some of the greatest human beings I've ever met, including most of my good friends, are scientists and engineers. Again, I love science, but science cannot flourish without epistemic humility, without debate, both in the pages of academic journals and in the public square, in good faith, long form conversations. Agree or disagree, I believe Robert's voice should be part of the debate. To call him a conspiracy theorist and arrogantly dismiss everything he says without addressing it diminishes the public's trust in the scientific process. At the same time, dogmatic skepticism of all scientific output on controversial topics like the pandemic is equally, if not more dishonest and destructive. I recommend that people read and listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr, his arguments and his ideas. But I also recommend, as I say in this conversation, that people read and listen to Vincent Racaniello from This Week in Virology, Dan Wilson from Debunk The Funk, and the Twitter and books of Paul Offit, Eric Topol, and others who are outspoken in their disagreement with Robert. It is disagreement, not conformity that bends the long arc of humanity toward truth and wisdom. In this process of disagreement, everybody has a lesson to teach you, but we must have the humility to hear it and to learn from it. This is The Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's the 4th of July, Independence Day. So simple question, simple, big question. What do you love about this country, the United States of America?<|eot_id|>"}

I think Ukrainians are very lucky to fight to the end. And the morale there is quite high. I've talked to nobody... This was a year ago in August with Kherson. Everybody was proud to fight and die for their country.

And you have to have an honest communication about how to do it, so that companies are not terrified of regulation, overreach regulation. And then government is not terrified of tech companies, of manipulating them in some direct or indirect ways, so there's a trust that builds versus a distrust. Basically, that old phone, where Khrushchev can call John F. Kennedy, is needed.<|eot_id|>"}

Vincent Racaniello, who hosts This Week in Virology. Brilliant guy, I've had him on the podcast. Somebody you've been battling with is Paul Offit, interesting Twitter, interesting books.
