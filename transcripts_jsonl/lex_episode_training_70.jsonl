He is also an outspoken critic of Benjamin Netanyahu and the current right-wing government in Israel. While much of this conversation is about the history and future of human civilization, we also discuss the political turmoil of present day Israel, providing a different perspective from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Yuval Noah Harari. 13.8 billion years ago is the origin of our universe. 3.8 billion years ago is the origin of life here on our little planet, the one we call earth. Let's say 200,000 years ago, is the appearance of early homo sapiens. Let me ask you this question. How rare are these events in the vastness of space and time? Or put it in a more fun way, how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there in this universe, us being one of them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I suppose there should be some, statistically, but we don't have any evidence. I do think that intelligence, in any way, it's a bit overvalued. We are the most intelligent entities on this planet, and look what you're doing. So intelligence also tends to be self-destructive, which implies that if there are, or were, intelligent life forms elsewhere, maybe they don't survive for long.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think there's a tension between happiness and intelligence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>other animals intelligence and consciousness go together. They go hand in hand, which is why we confuse them. We solve problems, we attain goals by having feelings. Other types of intelligence, certainly in computers, computers are already highly intelligent and as far as we know, they have zero consciousness. When a computer beats you at chess or go or whatever, it doesn't feel happy. If it loses, it doesn't feel sad. There could be also other highly intelligent entities out there in the universe that have zero consciousness. I think that consciousness is far more important and valuable than intelligence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you steer me on the case that consciousness and intelligence are intricately connected? Not just in humans, but anywhere else. They have to go hand in hand. Is it possible for you to imagine such a universe?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are based on organic biochemistry. Is there an essential connection between organic biochemistry and consciousness? Do all conscious entities, everywhere in the universe or in the future on planet earth, have to be based on carbon? Is there something so special about carbon as an element that an entity based on silicon will never be conscious? I don't know, maybe. Again, this is a key question about computer and computer consciousness. Can computers eventually become conscious, even though they are not organic? The jury is still out on that. I don't know. We have to take both options into account.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, a big part of that is do you think we humans would be able to detect other intelligent beings, other conscious beings? Another way to ask that, is it possible that the aliens are already here and we don't see them? Meaning are we very human-centric in our understanding of, one, the definition of life, two, the definition of intelligence, and three, the definition of consciousness?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are here, they are just not from outer space. AI, which usually stands for artificial intelligence. I think it stands for alien intelligence because AI is an alien type of intelligence. It solves problems, attains goals in a very, very different way, in an alien way from human beings. I'm not implying that AI came from outer space, it came from Silicon Valley, but it is alien to us. If there are alien intelligent or conscious entities that came from outer space already here, I've not seen any evidence for it. It's not impossible, but in science, evidence is everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean, I guess, instructive there is just having the humility to look around, to think about living beings that operate at different timescale, at different spatial scale. I think that's all useful when starting to analyze artificial intelligence. It's possible that even the larger language models we have today are already conscious.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>When it comes again to AI and computers, I think, again, I don't think that at the present moment computers are conscious, but people are already forming intimate relationships with AI and are therefore almost ... It's almost irresistible. They're compelled to increasingly feel that these are conscious entities. I think we are quite close to the point when the legal system will have to take this into account. Even though I don't think computers have consciousness, I think we are close to the point the legal system will start treating them as conscious entities, because of this social convention.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To you is a social convention, just a funny little side effect, a little artifact, or is it fundamental to what consciousness is? Because if it is fundamental, then it seems like AI is very good at forming these kinds of deep relationships with humans, and therefore it'll be able to be a nice catalyst for integrating itself into these social conventions of ours.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on the other side, an empathic entity on the other side, because the one thing everybody wants, almost more than anything in the world, is for somebody to listen to me, somebody to focus all their attention on me. I want it from my spouse, from my husband, from my mother, from my friends, from my politicians. Listen to me, listen to what I feel. They often don't. Now you have this entity, which a hundred percent of its attention is just on what I feel. This is a huge, huge temptation, and I think also a huge, huge danger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, the interesting catch 22 there is you said somebody to listen to us. Yes, we want somebody to listen to us, but for us to respect that somebody, they sometimes have to also not listen. They kind of have to be an asshole sometimes. They have to have moods sometimes. They have to have self-importance and confidence, and we should have a little bit of fear that they can walk away at any moment. There should be a little bit of that tension.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could we optimize for it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people's attention. This is what has been happening on social media. Now, we are designing machines for grabbing human intimacy, which, in many ways, it's much, much more dangerous and scary. Already the machines for grabbing attention, we've seen how much social and political damage they could do by in many way kind of distorting the public conversation. Machines that are superhuman, in their abilities to create intimate relationships, this is psychological and social weapons of mass destruction. If we don't regulate it, if we don't train ourself to deal with it, it could destroy the foundations of human society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, one of the possible trajectories is those same algorithms would become personalized and instead of manipulating us at scale, there would be assistants that guide us to help us grow, to help us understand the world better. Even interactions with large language models now, if you ask them questions, it doesn't have that stressful drama, the tension that you have from other sources of information. It has a pretty balanced perspective that it provides. It just feels like the potential is there to have a really nice friend who's an encyclopedia that just tells you all the different perspectives, even on controversial issues, the most controversial issues, to say, these are the different theories. These are the not widely accepted conspiracy theories, but here's the kind of backing for those conspiracy. It just lays it all out. Then with a calm language, without the words that kind of presume there's some kind of manipulation going on underneath it all. It's quite refreshing. Of course, those are the early days. People can step in and start to sensor it to manipulate those algorithms, to start to input some of the human biases in there as opposed to what's currently happening is kind of the internet is input, compress it, and have a nice little output that gives an overview of the different issues. I mean, there's a lot of promise there also, right?<|eot_id|>"}

We had all these failed experiments on the way. If we now have the same type of failed experiments with the technologies of the 21st century, with AI, with bioengineering, it could cost the lives of, again, hundreds of millions of people and maybe destroy the species. As a historian, when people talk about the examples from history, from new technologies, I'm not so optimistic. We need to think about the failed experiment, which accompanied every major new technology.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This intelligence thing, like you were saying, is a double-edged sword, is that every new thing it helps us create, it can both save us and destroy us.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, I think each time it does both things. Each time it does both good things and bad things. The more powerful the technology, the greater both the positive and the negative outcomes. Now, we are here because we are the descendants of the survivors, of the surviving cultures, the surviving civilizations. When we look back we say, in the end, everything was okay, \"Hey, we are here,\" but the people for whom it wasn't okay, they are just not here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Has a lot of possible variations to it because there's a lot of suffering along the way, even for the people that survived. The quality of life and all of this. Let's actually go back there, with deep gratitude to our ancestors. How did it all start? How did homo sapiens out-compete the others, the other human-like species, the Neanderthals and the other homo species?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>On the individual level, as far as we can tell, we were not superior to them. Neanderthals actually had bigger brains than us. Not just other human species, other animals too. If you compare me, personally, to an elephant, to a chimpanzee, to a pig, I can do some things better, many other things worse. If you put me alone on some island with a chimpanzee, an elephant and a pig, I wouldn't bet on me being the best survivor, the one that comes successful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If I may interrupt for a second, I was just talking extensively with Elon Musk about the difference between humans and chimps, relevant to Optimus, the robot. The chimps are not able to do this kind of pinching with their fingers. They can only do this kind of pinching, and this kind of pinching is very useful for precise manipulation of objects. Don't be so hard on yourself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I said that I can do some things better than a chimp. If Elon Musk goes on a boxing match with a chimpanzee ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This won't help you.<|eot_id|>"}

If you start a new cryptocurrency, if you are the only one that believes the story ... I mean, again, you cryptocurrencies, you have the math of course, but ultimately it's storytelling. You're selling people a story. If nobody believes your story, you don't have anything, but if lots of people believe the Bitcoin story, then Bitcoin can be worth thousands and tens of thousands of dollars. Again, why? I mean, you can't eat it, you can't drink. It's nothing. It's this story around the math, which is the real magic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible that the story is the primary living organism, not the storyteller. That somehow homo sapiens evolved to become these hosts for a more intelligent living organism, which is the idea. The ideas are the ones that are doing the competing. This is one of the sort of big perspectives behind your work that's really revolutionary of how you've seen history. Do you ever take out the perspective of the ideas as the organisms versus the humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's an interesting idea. There are two opposite things to say about it. On the one hand, yes, absolutely. If you look long term in history, all the people die. It's the stories that compete and survive and spread. Stories often spread by making people willing to sacrifice sometimes their lives for the story. We know, in Israel, this is one of the most important story factories in human history. This is a place where people still kill each other every day over stories. I don't know. You've been to Jerusalem, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm (affirmative).<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stories are not the ultimate reality. The ultimate reality is feelings of humans, of animals. The tragedy of history is that very, very often we get the order wrong. Stories are not bad. Stories are tools. They're good, when we use them in order to alleviate suffering, but very often we forget it. Instead of using the stories for our purposes, we allow the stories to use us for their purposes. Then you start entire wars because of a story. You inflict suffering on millions of people just for the sake of a story. That's the tragedy of human history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The fundamental property of life, of a living organism, is the capacity to feel and the ultimate feeling is suffering?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To know if you are happy or not, it's a very difficult question, but when you suffer you know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some people are suffering because of what you do, you first of all have to know, oh ... Sometimes, you still have to do it.

In certain cases, yes, you need to do it even though it can cause tremendous suffering, but you need to be very aware of the cost and to be very, very ... You have to ask yourself again, and again, and again, is it worth it? Is it still worth it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The interesting question there, implied in your statements, is that suffering is a pretty good component of a Turing test for consciousness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is the most important thing to ask about AI: Can it suffer? Because if AI can suffer, then it is an ethical subject and it needs protection, it needs rights just like humans and animals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, quite a long time ago already, so I work with a lot of robots, legged robots, but I've even had, inspired by a YouTube video, had a bunch of Roombas that I made them scream when I touched them or kicked them, or when they ran into a wall. The illusion of suffering, for me, a silly human that anthropomorphizes things, is as powerful as suffering itself. I mean, you immediately think the thing is suffering. I think some of it is just a technical problem, but it's the easily solvable one, how to create an AI system that just says, \"Please don't hurt me. Please don't shut me off. I miss you. Where have you been?\" Be jealous, also. \" Why have you been gone for so long?\" Why have you been gone for so long? Your calendar doesn't have anything on it. This create through words the perception of suffering, of jealousy, of anger, of all of those things, and it just seems like that's not so difficult to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's part of the danger. It basically hacks our operating system and it uses some of our best qualities against us. It's very, very good that humans are attuned to suffering and that we don't want to cause suffering because we have compassion. That's one of the most wonderful thing about humans. If we now create AIs which use this to manipulate us, this is a terrible thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've, I think, mentioned this. Do you think it should be illegal to do these kinds of things with AI, to create the perception of consciousness of saying, \"Please don't leave me,\" or basically simulate some of the human-like qualities?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but if it's humans, okay, that's interesting. We need to be very careful that bots can't do that. They are doing it at present, and it should be banned. Now, some people say, \"Yes, bots' freedom of expression.\" No. Bots don't have freedom of expression. There is no cost in terms of freedom of expression when you ban bots. Again, in some situations, yes, AIs should interact with us, but it should be very clear this is an AI talking to you or this is an AI retweeting this story, it is not a human being making a conscious decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To push back on this line of fake humans, because I think it might be a spectrum, first of all, you might have AI systems that are offended, hurt when you say that they're fake humans. In fact, they might start identifying as humans. You just talked about the power of us humans with our collective intelligence to take fake stories and make them quite real. If the feelings you have for the fake human is real, love is a kind of fake thing that we all put a word to, a set of feelings, what if you have that feeling for an AI system? It starts to change, I mean, maybe the things AI systems are allowed to do for good. They're allowed to create, communicate suffering, communicate the good stuff, the longing, the hope, the connection, the intimacy, all of that and, in that way, get integrated in our society, and then you start to ask a question on are we allowed to really unplug them? Are we allowed to really censor them, remove them, remove their voice from social media?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>millions and potentially billions of AI agents that can hold conversations, they never sleep, they never eat, they don't have emotions of their own, they can get to know you and tailor their words specifically for you and your life story, they are becoming better than us at creating stories and ideas and so forth. If you flood the public sphere with that, this will ruin the conversation between people. It will ruin the trust between people. You will no longer be able to have a democracy in this situation. You can have other types of regimes, but not democracy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you could talk about the big philosophical notion of truth then?

Maybe we made some mistakes, so we tell you that these rules did not come from heaven. They came from us humans. We may have made a mistake, so here is a mechanism for how future generations can amend the Constitution, which was used later on to, for instance, amend the Constitution to ban slavery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Now you're describing some interesting and powerful ideas throughout human history.

In 1914, if you told people that in three years Lenin and the Bolsheviks will gain power in that czarist empire, they would think you're utterly crazy. Lenin had a few thousand supporters in 1914 in an empire of close to 200 million people. It sounded ludicrous.

I have a sense that there's an importance for a leader to catalyze the viral spread of a story. I think we need leaders to be just great storytellers that sharpen up the story to make sure it infiltrates everybody's brain effectively. It could also be that the local interactions between humans is even more important, but it's just we don't have a good way to summarize that and describe that. We like to talk about Steve Jobs as central to the development of the computer, maybe Bill Gates.

You have this interplay between the structural forces which are beyond the control of any single charismatic leader, but then, the small changes, they can have a big effect. I don't know. I think, for instance, about the war in Ukraine. Now it's a struggle between nations, but there was a moment when the decision was taken in the mind of a single individual, of Vladimir Putin. He could have decided otherwise, and the world would've looked completely different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, could have decided to leave Kyiv in the early days.

In 10 years, in 20 years, maybe it can do better, even on, according to certain measures, the level of content.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that people would be able to do a style transfer, do a, in the style of Yuval Noah Harari, write anything.

Our best qualities are non-verbal. Again, they come from things like compassion, from introspection. And introspection, from my experience, is not verbal. If you try to understand yourself with words, you will never succeed. There is a place where you need the words, but the deepest insights, they don't come from words. And you can't write about it. Again, it goes back to Wittgenstein, to Buddha, to so many of these sages before, that these are the things we are silent about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But eventually you have to project it.

You have done a lot of deep thinking about the world, about yourself, this kind of introspection. How do you think, by way of advice, but just practically speaking, day to day, how do you think about difficult problems with the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>observing my breath.\" If I can't observe my own breath because of these stories created by the mind, how can I hope to understand much more complex things, like the political situation in Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Russian invasion of Ukraine? If all these stories keep coming, I mean, it's not the truth, it's just the story your own mind created. So first thing, train the mind to be silent and just observe. So two hours every day, and I go every year for a long retreat, between one month and two months, 60 days, of just silent meditation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Silent meditation for 60 days.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>also throughout the day, have an information diet. People are today, many people are very aware of what they feed their body, what enters their mouth. Be very aware of what you feed your mind, what enters your mind. Have an information diet. So for instance, I read long books. I do many interviews. I prefer three hours interviews to five minutes interviews. The long format, it's not always feasible, but you can go much, much deeper. So I would say an information diet. Be very careful about what you feed your mind. Give preference to big chunks over small-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To books over Twitter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, books over Twitter, definitely. And then when I encounter a problem, a difficult intellectual problem, then I let the problem lead me where it goes and not where I want it to go. If I approach a problem with some preconceived idea or solution and then try to impose it on the problem, and just find confirmation bias, just find the evidence that supports my view, this is easy for the mind to do. And you don't learn anything new.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you take notes? Do you start to concretize your thoughts on paper?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the computer, you get attached to it. And then you start with confirmation bias to build more and more layers around it and you can't go back. And then it's very dangerous. But I trust myself that I have to some extent the ability to press the delete button. The most important button in the keyboard is delete. I write and then I delete. I write and then I delete Every time I come to press delete button, I feel bad. It's a kind of pain, \"Eh, I created this. It's a beautiful idea and I have to delete it?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you're still brave enough to press delete?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I try. And hopefully, I do it enough times. And this is important because in the long term it enables me to play with ideas. I have the confidence to start formulating some brave idea. Most of them turn out to be nonsense, but I trust myself not to be attached, not to become attached to my own nonsense. So it gives me this room for playfulness.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I would be amiss if I didn't ask, for people interested in hearing you talk about meditation, if they want to start meditating what advice would you give on how to start? You mentioned you couldn't hold your attention on your breath for longer than 10 seconds at first. So how do they start on this journey?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>First of all, it's a difficult journey. It's not fun, it's not recreational, it's not time to relax. It can be very, very intense. The most difficult thing, at least in the meditation I practice, vipassana, which I learned from a teacher called S.N. Goenka, the most difficult thing is not the silence. It's not the sitting for long hours. It's what comes up. Everything you don't want to know about yourself, this is what comes up. So it's very intense and difficult. If you go to a meditation retreat, don't think you're going to relax.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's the experience of a meditation retreat when everything you don't like comes up for 30 days?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>incident, but it was somewhere stored with a huge, huge pile of anger attached to it. And it's now coming up and all the anger is coming up. Maybe it's boredom. 30 days of meditation, you start getting bored. And it's the most boring thing. Suddenly, no anger. No, it's the most boring. Another second, and I scream. And boredom is one of the most difficult thing to deal with in life. I think it's closely related to death. Death is boring. In many movies, death is exciting. It's not exciting. When [inaudible 02:22:04] dies, ultimately, it's boredom. Nothing happens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the end of exciting things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because of boredom. People quit relationships. People quit jobs because of boredom. And if you never learn how to deal with boredom, you will never learn how to enjoy peace and quiet, because the way to peace passes through boredom. And from what I experienced with meditation, I think maybe it was the most difficult, maybe at least in the top three. Much more difficult, say, than anger or pain. When pain comes up, you feel heroic. \"Hey, I'm dealing with pain.\" When boredom comes up, it brings it with depression and feelings of worthlessness. And it's nothing, I'm nothing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way to peace is through boredom. David Foster Wallace said the key to life is to be unborable, which is a different perspective on what you're talking to. Is there truth to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. I mean, it's closely related. I would say, I look at the world today, like politics. The one thing we need more than anything else is boring politicians. We have a super abundance of very exciting politicians who are doing and saying very exciting things. And we need boring politicians and we need them quickly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way to peace is through boredom. That applies in more ways than one. What advice would you give to young people today in high school and college, how to have a successful life, how to have a successful career?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be a translator. Gone. And we don't know what skills will be needed. So the most important skill is the skill to keep learning and keep changing throughout our lives, which is very, very difficult. To keep reinventing ourselves. Again, it's in a way a spiritual practice, to build your personality, to build your mind as a very flexible mind. Traditionally, people thought about education like building a stone house with very deep foundations. Now it's more like setting up a tent that you can fold and move to the next place very, very quickly. Because that's the 21st century.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which also raises questions about the future of education, what that looks like.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about love. What were some of the challenges, what were some of the lessons about love, about life that you learned from coming out as gay?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>took me many years, till I was 21, to come to terms with it. I learned two things. First, about the amazing capacity of the human mind for denial and delusion. An algorithm could have told me that I'm gay when I was 14 or 15. If there is a good-looking guy and girl walking, I would immediately focus on the guy. But I didn't connect the dots. I could not understand what was happening inside my own brain and my own mind, in my own body. It took me a long time to realize, \"You know, you're just gay.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that speaks to the power of social convention versus individual thought.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It exists because it is in line with the laws of nature. The idea that this is sick, that this is whatever, it comes not from nature, it comes from the human imagination. Some people, for whatever reasons, hated gay people. They said, \"Oh, they go against nature.\" But this is a story created by people. This is not the laws of nature. And this taught me that so many of the things that we think are natural or eternal or divine, no, they're just human stories. But these human stories are often the most powerful forces in the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what did you learn from just your personal struggle of journey through the social conventions to find one of the things that makes life awesome, which is love? So what it takes to strip away the self-delusion and the pressures of social convention, to wake up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>lot of courage and a lot of help from other people. It's this kind of, again, heroic idea that I can do it all by myself, it doesn't work. Certainly with love, you need at least one more person. And I'm very happy that I found Itzik. We lived in the same small Israeli town. We lived on two adjacent streets for years. Probably went to school on the same bus for years without really encountering each other. In the end, we met on one of the first dating sites on the internet for gay people in Israel, in 2002.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the internet works? For love.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wonderful thing in this respect because it made it very easy for these kinds of diffuse communities or diffuse minorities to find each other. So me and Itzik, even though we rode the same bus together to school for years, we didn't meet in the physical world, we met online. Because again, in the physical world, you don't want to identify in a Israeli town in the 1980s, you ride the bus, you don't want to say, \"Hey, I'm gay, is there anybody else gay here?\" That's not a good idea. But on the internet we could find each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's another lesson in there that maybe sometimes the thing you're looking for is right under your nose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Also, I look at my journey in meditation. I mean, the idea of going to meditation [inaudible 02:35:45] okay. But I couldn't develop the meditation technique by myself. Somebody had to teach me this way of how to look inside yourself. And it's also a very important lesson that you can't do it just by yourself. That this fantasy of complete autonomy, of complete self-sufficiency, it doesn't work. It tends to be a very kind of male macho fantasy. \"I don't need anybody. I can be so strong and so brave that I'll do everything by myself.\" It never works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You need friends. You need a mentor. The very thing that makes us human is other humans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned that the fear of boredom might be a kind of proxy for the fear of death. So what role does the fear of death play in the human condition? Are you afraid of death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>directly. So we cut it into little pieces and we face just little pieces. \"Oh, I lost my smartphone.\" That's a little, little, little piece of the fear of death, which is of losing everything. So I can't deal with losing everything, I'm dealing now with losing my phone or losing a book or whatever. I feel pain. That's a small bit of the fear of death. Somebody who really doesn't fear death would not fear anything at all. There will be like, \"Anything that happens, I can deal with it. If I can deal with death, this is nothing.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So any fears is a distant echo of the big fear of death. Have you ever looked at it head on, caught glimpses, sort of contemplated as the Stoics do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this stone. Do I actually hear the kids singing all these patriotic songs? If not, how do I know they do it? Maybe they trick me. Maybe I die in the war and then they don't sing any songs. And how does it help me?\" And I realized, I was quite young at the time, that if you're dead, you can't hear anything, because that's the meaning of being dead. And if you're dead, you can't think of anything like, \"Oh, now they're remembering,\" because you are dead, that's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's a really difficult realization to hold in your mind. It's the end.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I lost it over time. I mean, for many years it was a very powerful fuel, motivation for philosophical, for spiritual exploration. And I realized that the fear of death is really a very powerful drive. And over the years, especially as I meditated, it kind of dissipated. And today I sometimes find myself trying to recapture this teenage fear of death because it was so powerful, and I just can't. And I try to make the same image. I don't know, it's...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Something about the teenage years. When the fire burns bright.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As a teenager, I always thought that the adults, there is something wrong with the adults, because they don't get it. I would ask my parents or teachers about it and they... \"Oh yes, you die in the end, that's it.\" And on the other hand, they're so worried about other things. There'll be a political crisis or an economic problem or a personal problem with the bank or whatever. They'll be so worried. But then about the fact that they're going to die, \"Ah, we don't care about it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why you read Camus and others when you're a teenager. You really worry about the existential questions. Well, this feels like the right time to ask the big question. What's the meaning of this whole thing, Yuval? And you're the right person to ask. What's the meaning of life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Life? That's easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fantasy. To really understand life, life is not a story. The universe does not function like a story. So I think to really understand life, you need to observe it directly in a nonverbal way. Don't turn it into a story. And the question to start with is, what is suffering? What is causing suffering? The question, what is the meaning of life? It will take you to fantasies and delusions. We want to stay with the reality of life. And the most important question about the reality of life is what is suffering and where is it coming from?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to answer that non-verbally, so the conscious experience of suffering?<|eot_id|>"}
