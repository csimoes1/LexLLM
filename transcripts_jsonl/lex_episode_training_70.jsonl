He is also an outspoken critic of Benjamin Netanyahu and the current right-wing government in Israel. While much of this conversation is about the history and future of human civilization, we also discuss the political turmoil of present day Israel, providing a different perspective from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Yuval Noah Harari. 13.8 billion years ago is the origin of our universe. 3.8 billion years ago is the origin of life here on our little planet, the one we call earth. Let's say 200,000 years ago, is the appearance of early homo sapiens. Let me ask you this question. How rare are these events in the vastness of space and time? Or put it in a more fun way, how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there in this universe, us being one of them?<|eot_id|>"}

Not just in humans, but anywhere else. They have to go hand in hand. Is it possible for you to imagine such a universe?<|eot_id|>"}

We have to take both options into account.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, a big part of that is do you think we humans would be able to detect other intelligent beings, other conscious beings? Another way to ask that, is it possible that the aliens are already here and we don't see them?

It's not impossible, but in science, evidence is everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean, I guess, instructive there is just having the humility to look around, to think about living beings that operate at different timescale, at different spatial scale. I think that's all useful when starting to analyze artificial intelligence. It's possible that even the larger language models we have today are already conscious.<|eot_id|>"}

Yes, we want somebody to listen to us, but for us to respect that somebody, they sometimes have to also not listen. They kind of have to be an asshole sometimes. They have to have moods sometimes. They have to have self-importance and confidence, and we should have a little bit of fear that they can walk away at any moment. There should be a little bit of that tension.<|eot_id|>"}

If we don't regulate it, if we don't train ourself to deal with it, it could destroy the foundations of human society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, one of the possible trajectories is those same algorithms would become personalized and instead of manipulating us at scale, there would be assistants that guide us to help us grow, to help us understand the world better. Even interactions with large language models now, if you ask them questions, it doesn't have that stressful drama, the tension that you have from other sources of information. It has a pretty balanced perspective that it provides. It just feels like the potential is there to have a really nice friend who's an encyclopedia that just tells you all the different perspectives, even on controversial issues, the most controversial issues, to say, these are the different theories. These are the not widely accepted conspiracy theories, but here's the kind of backing for those conspiracy. It just lays it all out. Then with a calm language, without the words that kind of presume there's some kind of manipulation going on underneath it all. It's quite refreshing. Of course, those are the early days. People can step in and start to sensor it to manipulate those algorithms, to start to input some of the human biases in there as opposed to what's currently happening is kind of the internet is input, compress it, and have a nice little output that gives an overview of the different issues. I mean, there's a lot of promise there also, right?<|eot_id|>"}

The illusion of suffering, for me, a silly human that anthropomorphizes things, is as powerful as suffering itself. I mean, you immediately think the thing is suffering. I think some of it is just a technical problem, but it's the easily solvable one, how to create an AI system that just says, \"Please don't hurt me. Please don't shut me off. I miss you. Where have you been?\" Be jealous, also. \" Why have you been gone for so long?\" Why have you been gone for so long? Your calendar doesn't have anything on it.

In fact, they might start identifying as humans. You just talked about the power of us humans with our collective intelligence to take fake stories and make them quite real. If the feelings you have for the fake human is real, love is a kind of fake thing that we all put a word to, a set of feelings, what if you have that feeling for an AI system? It starts to change, I mean, maybe the things AI systems are allowed to do for good. They're allowed to create, communicate suffering, communicate the good stuff, the longing, the hope, the connection, the intimacy, all of that and, in that way, get integrated in our society, and then you start to ask a question on are we allowed to really unplug them? Are we allowed to really censor them, remove them, remove their voice from social media?<|eot_id|>"}

It could also be that the local interactions between humans is even more important, but it's just we don't have a good way to summarize that and describe that.

So one is internally with advisors, you have to have hope that there's people that would disagree that would have a lively debate internally. Then there's also the thing you mentioned, which is direct communication between Putin and Zelensky in private, picking up a phone, a rotary phone, old school. I still believe in the power of that.

Another way that really worries me, for me is probably more likely, is a brave new world kind of thing that sort of removes the flaws of humans, maybe it removes the diversity in humans, and makes us all kind of these dopamine chasing creatures that just kind of maximize enjoyment in the short term, which kind of seems like a good thing maybe in the short term, but it creates a society that doesn't think, that doesn't create, that just is sitting there enjoying itself at a more and more rapid pace, which seems like another kind of society that could be easily controlled by a centralized center of power.

I, as you said, have interviewed Benjamin Netanyahu recently, I don't know if you're aware. But doing such things will also ... You now pick up a new menu of items, a new set of conspiracy theories you're now a part of.
