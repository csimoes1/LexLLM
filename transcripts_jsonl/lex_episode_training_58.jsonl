Two eyes, two antennae, two ear flaps. I don't know what they do. And its punch can be as strong as a bullet. And the other type with the spears, divers call them thumb splitters because if you stick your finger near it'll cut your thumb down to the bone. So I had one as a pet. All night I would hear banging on the PVC pipe. And I've got to tell you, if they have the best eyesight of any animal because they see in seven different ways. And when you make eye contact with this thing, it's just absolutely terrifying. But you can eat them as sushi.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But what do you find funny? Come on. This is an interesting subject.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I find Monty Python. I find absurdity funny.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. I find absurdity funny. I think that's the thing. When people come at me, and maybe this is an Eastern European thing, when they're like, \"How can you find this very dark subject funny?\" It's like, well, the humor. First of all, the humor is that you're making fun of something that's dark. So already it's absurd. It's completely inappropriate. Second, just psychologically, Joan Rivers said that Winston Churchill said, I don't know if it's true, that when you make people laugh, you're giving them a little vacation. And I was just thinking about this the other day, how when I die, if, I want my funeral to be a roast. It doesn't help me that everyone's sad. If I brought people happiness or joy in life, whatever, I want to keep doing that in death. Your sadness doesn't help me. I know you can't help it, but tell stories of how I made you laugh. Make fun of me. Make me the punching bag. Even literally, take me out of that coffin and beat the-. Make me a pinata. I don't care. I don't understand, well, I do understand, but it's sad for me when people are like, \"This isn't funny. That isn't funny.\" The way I look at humor is the way it's like a chef, right? It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good, but some of these really obscure ingredients to make it palatable, that's takes skill. So if you're dealing with a subject that is very emotional or intense and you can make people laugh, then that takes skill and that's the relief for them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's all about timing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But no, go ahead. It doesn't have to be a pirate joke this one time.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By the way, the thing that is very heartbreaking about the North Korean situation is that they have a great sense of humor. It would be a lot easier if these were robots or drones. They have big personalities, big senses of humor, and that made it much harder to leave and interact with these people because I mean, there's nothing more human and universal than laughter and laughter's free.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you saying there's humor even amongst the people that have most of their freedoms taken away?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Especially. I mean, again, we're from the Soviet Union, there's [inaudible 00:10:57] I mean, Russian humor is a thing because there's nothing you can, if you can't have food or nice things, at least you can have joy and make each other laugh. I think about it all the time, and I think about my guide all the time. It's been, what, 2012? So it's been 11 years since I've been there, and she's still there. And everyone I've seen is still there. They just recently electrified the border. So you can't even, even the few people who are escaping can't do it anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor. I attribute the Soviet Union for having that because of the really deep education system. You got to read a lot of literature.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And because of that, you get to kind of learn about the cruelty, the injustices, the absurdity of the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As long as the writing is not about the current regime.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But I think if you look at African Americans, Jewish Americans, gay Americans, they are all disproportionate in terms of attributing to comedy. It's not because these groups have some kind of magic to them., It's that when you are on the outside looking in, A, you're going to have different perspective than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve. But also, when you don't have anything to lose, at the very least, you can make each other laugh and find happiness that way. So that is something that I think is an important thing to recognize.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what do you find funny? What makes you giggle in the most joyful of ways? The suffering of others?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, there are YouTube videos of fat people falling down and they're really funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's two kinds of people in this world, those that laugh at those videos and those that don't.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. And those that are in them. My friend Jesse just told me a great Norm Macdonald joke, and this is a good litmus test joke because he says, \"A certain group of people lose their minds and a certain group of people just stare at you.\" And he goes, \"This kind of...\" and so I'll tell you the joke. This is Norm McDonald. A guy walks into a bar and he sees someone at the bar who has a big pumpkin for a head. And the guy's like, \"Dude, what happened to you?\" He goes, \"Ugh, you never believe this. I got one of those genie lamps and this genie.\" He's like, \"Well, what happened?\" He goes, \"Well, the first wish, I wished for a hundred million dollars.\" He's like, \"Yeah, did you get it?\" He goes, \"Yeah.\" He goes, \"In my bank account. Feels fine.\" He goes, \"All right. Well, the second wish, I wished to have sex with as many beautiful women as I want.\" He goes, \"Did that happen?\" He goes, \"Yeah, it was amazing.\" He goes, \"Then what?\" \"Well, I wished for a giant pumpkin head.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

And I remember I saw him once in LA and the girl ahead of me, at the table ahead of me was with her boyfriend, this basic chick, pumpkin spice. She turns to him and she goes, \"What is this?\" And I remember the first time he was on Jimmy Kimmel, and he tells one of his jokes and it was like, \"Why does ET Reese's Pieces so much? Well, that's what sperm tastes like on his home planet.\" And no one laughs. And he goes, \"Oh, come on guys. I have cancer.\" And it just cuts to this Marine in the audience with his arms crossed. So if you know what he's doing, it's just absolutely amazing. He opened for Tenacious D once in somewhere, I think in Ireland or the UK, one of those. And they're booing him because his jokes are often not funny. He's like, \"Hey, where did my whore ex-wife run off to with that dentist she's shacking up with? I don't know. But when I see her in court next month, Alaska.\" So they're booing and he goes, \"All right, do you guys want me to bring out Tenacious D?\" They're like, \"Yeah.\" \"Do you want to see your heroes of my Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Come on, let me hear it. Do you want to see Tenacious D?\" \"Yeah.\" He goes, \"All right, if I tell this next joke and you don't boo me, I'll bring out Tenacious D.\" And it's like, I'm trying to think of one that's not too...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Self censorship is never good.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of the things that I'm most thankful for, this is a common answer, but I can back it up, is my family. Because my nephew, Lucas, is now six years old. And when kids have a sense of humor, it's like just miraculous. So he stole my sister's phone, his mom. Figured out that grandma is listed as mom in the phone, and he calls her up and he's like, \"Michael's in the hospital. He's really sick. He didn't want to tell you.\" And she's freaking out. He goes, \"Prank.\" So I took him, Dinesh D'Souza just released a movie called Police State, which was actually really good, highly recommend it. I was surprised how much I liked it because he wasn't going Republicans good, Democrats bad. It was just about authoritarianism. And he had a movie premier at Mar-a-Lago. So I'm like, I got to bring Lucas to Mar-a-Lago. So Lucas is, I'm like, \"We're going to the President's house.\" He's like, \"Oh, the White House?\" And I'm like, \"No, no, a former president.\" He goes, \"Oh, Abe Lincoln?\" And I'm like, \"Okay, kid logic.\" He's giving logical answers. This is kind of like AI, you have to program it. It's using logic correctly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You should have told him it's a president that's second to only Ab Lincoln in terms of greatness.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Didn't even imply that. When I in, as you probably know as you know, but as many people watching this also know, Harvey Pekar who had the comic book series, American Splendor was the subject of the movie, American Splendor. He wrote a graphic novel about me in 2006 called Ego and Hubris, which goes for like $150 on eBay. It's not worth it, just downloaded it. And I met Harvey because I wrote this screenplay about this band from the 80s called Rubber Rodeo. It's a real band. And the keyboardist, Gary Leib, who passed away. Rest in peace, Gary. Introduced me to Harvey because he did the animation for the movie. And this script's been in my desk for over 20 years, and I realized thanks to my buddy Eric July, who has some huge success with his comics, I could just produce this as a graphic novel. So I've got an artist, we're getting it together, so I'm going to make it happen finally. And it's some of the best writing I've ever done. I'm really proud of the story. It's ironic reading it now, because when you're a writer, obviously different books, you put different aspects of yourself into them, and this story is very, very dark because basically they did all the right things and they went nowhere. What I realized was reading it now, that all these fears I had over 20 years ago about what if I'm not going to make it? What if I'm doing all the hard work and it's still not enough? Now it's been disproven because I can at least pay my rent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you feel like you've made it because you said you could pay your rent.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because I have a lot of people who I care about and who care about me.

And then you start losing the places you go to, and then it was just like, \"Holy crap. I'm very isolated.\" And here in Austin, there's not as much to do, obviously as in New York, but there's a lot of people here. More people are coming all the time. So if I ever want to hang out with someone, I've got a long list. And these are people who I've known for a very long time, people who know me quite well, so I could be myself. My awful, awful, awful, awful self. And that is something I don't take lightly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Now you moved to Texas, it's going to secede.<|eot_id|>"}

I give it national attention. It was also really funny because a lot of people are like, \"These people have been in Texas, five minutes, blah, blah.\" I go to the Texas legislature, meet with the guy, have a nice conversation. A month or two later, unanimous, I think, he gets voted kicked out of Congress because he got an intern drunk and was inappropriate with her. At least it was a girl in this case.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of times when you write a story that involves Putin, people are really ideological. They don't write with a calmness and the clarity and the rigor of history, there's emotion in it. There's almost a virtue signaling. And he doesn't have that, even though he is Ukrainian and has very strong opinions on the matter. Anyway, there's people like that and he's done an incredible job researching a recent event. Like he says, I was looking at everything that's been written about the war in Ukraine and realizing the old Churchill line, that historians are the worst ones to write about current events except everybody else. And so he's like, \"I might as well just write about this war.\" And he does an exceptional job summarizing day by day, the details of this war. Anyway.

Because sometimes when it's hard, you forget you've done great things in your life. You've made accomplishments. It doesn't have to be some amazing factory. It could just be like my first job or I got a raise or you know what? Anything. So there's this amazing sculptor named Jake Michael Singer, a singer who's a sculptor, and I saw a piece of him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How's his singing voice?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I followed him on Instagram, he followed me back and he says, \"What's the point of being an artist if the work I create isn't in the spaces of people I like and admire?\" He's a big fan of yours. You've given him and our episodes together give him joy. So he said, \"If I make Lex a sculpture, will he put it on the-\" He said, \"If I make Lex a sculpture, will he put on the shelf behind him?\" And what that reminded me of is when I was a kid, you read Batman comics and there's the Bat Cave. And the Bat Cave has all this cool stuff in it. I didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the bat cave had an origin story. So the giant penny, the dinosaur, there was actually a story where that came from. So if you're a fan of a show, you can spot, oh, this is when this appeared. This is when that appeared. This is when that appeared. So he made you this sculpture. He lives in Turkey and it's called Chance Murmur. And it is, I haven't even seen it yet.

Let's go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of the things that drives me crazy is when people, especially conservatives, think that all contemporary art is ugly or abstract or literally garbage. And there's a lot of that, but so much of the stuff out there in galleries is not only not crazy expensive, but they're trying to sell things for people in their house. And these are young artists. They're trying to add beauty. I have a list, so if you don't believe me and you think all contemporary art is garbage or terrible, go to the website or any of these places that I'm going to rattle off, look through them. And you're telling me that it's not about creating beauty and joy and things in people's lives? So I don't have any relationship with any of these people, these are just some galleries I follow on Instagram. Outre Gallery, Antler Gallery, Giant Robot 2, Beinart, I don't know how to pronounce it, I'm sorry. B-E-I-N-A-R-T. Spoke Art Gallery, Var Gallery in Milwaukee, I was there. The pieces were not expensive at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What kind of art are we talking about? Everything? Paintings?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mostly paintings. Mostly paintings. Some sculptures too, like this. Corey Helford is my favorite one in LA. Night Gallery, Vertical Gallery, Avant Gallery, Hive Gallery, Haven Gallery, and Curio Art Gallery. I'm telling you, it's not exorbitant. This is not the kind of thing where you have to go to a museum and be like, \"This doesn't make sense to me.\" You look at it right away, you're like, \"Okay, I know what this is.\" And it's beautiful. It's awesome. And you're supporting someone who's young and creative trying to do something and make the world a better place. So I'm a big fan of the contemporary art scene. A lot of it is not great, but even the stuff that's not great is very rarely disgusting or gross. It's just like, okay, I've seen this before, or something like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's like the difference between, there's a standup where I'll pay money for the ticket, and someone who's an opener. It's like, I wouldn't pay to see him perform, but he sure still made me laugh. That person is still by far more good than bad. So a lot of this art isn't stuff I would own, but it's like, okay, I get it. I like it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, as the analogy goes, I really like going to open mics, actually, because funny...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your sense about this? Is antisemitism like any other brand of hate? There's a lot of hate out there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I don't think it's like any other brand of hate, because I don't think racists or transphobes or homophobes or misogynists or xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the killing of black Americans, transgender people, gay people, women, or immigrants. And it's not only something that's talked about, it's something that has actually happened. And not just the Holocaust, but just centuries of pilgrims, right? There's this great book that I read many years ago called The Satanization of the Jews. Camille Paglia recommended it and I read it. And they live in this certain specific kind of antisemitism. And again, I'm not talking about people who are against Israel or something like that. I'm talking specifically about Jew hatred. They have this moral calculus that Jews are the only people who are capable of good or evil, and Jews are exclusively capable of evil. For example, if you look at the George W. Bush White House, you had W, you had Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, a lot of these NeoCon advisors. So if there's 10 people in a room and there's one Jewish person, it's his fault, and the rest are Jew controlled. So again, they only exist as a puppet of Jews in this kind of worldview. And it's like, to me, if there were no Jews on earth, it is crazy to say that John Bolton and Liz Cheney and Lindsey Graham wouldn't be pushing for more war. That makes no sense to me. It's like, you blame the Jews when bad things happen, but when a Jewish person does something good, it doesn't really matter. Or just wait, he's going to do something bad. Well, yeah, that's true. Human beings do good things and then they do bad things sometimes. But it only counts when that Jewish person does the bad thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder what's a way to fight antisemitism and fight hate in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the only or the best way, because I thought a lot about this, about how did gay Americans go from being universally hated and despised to the point that many people in the '80s went to their graves, those who had AIDS, without even telling their parents because they were so scared, to now Times Square is just covered in pride flags. And this also works for Islamophobia and some of these other bigotry, is what I call the ambassador program. Because as soon as you know someone who is a member of a certain group, it is a lot harder to be bigoted against them because instead of this being this out group that's somewhere out there, it's like, wait a minute, I work with this guy. Yeah, he's kind of a jerk and maybe he sees things a little differently than me, but this guy is not a horrible human being. So I think the only way to fight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of the counter to whatever archetype or stereotype is in the culture.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Karl Marx wrote that, \"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of a soulless condition.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They start living consciously. They take morality seriously. They try, we all fail, to be moral good people.

Now, lots of religious people use religion to rationalize their bad behavior or sinful or big ego, so on and so forth. That exists, that's true. But to say that it never helps anyone and it's universally the... See, Marx was talking about a period, I mean, I'll defend his quote, when his argument was the masses are being starved and oppressed, but they're promised, don't worry, you'll have riches in heaven. So you should kind of let yourself be pushed around now, and this is kind of this BS bargain that the people are being given. So that was, I think, the point he was making.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was 17, 18, freshman year, and I was reading all this criticism of the Bible and I was like, \"Look, this is in there. Look at this in there.\" And he put his hand on my shoulder and he says, \"Michael, there's nothing you're going to tell me that's going to make me lose my faith.\" And that was a very self-aware and profound thing to say. As I've gotten older, I know lots of religious people. There's no part of me that thinks they're wrong or they should be mocked. It also reminds me of when people sneer at addicts in recovery, they're like, \"Alcoholism isn't a disease, it's a choice.\" It's like, wait a minute. You don't know what it's like to have your entire life ruined by drugs or alcohol.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}

If you've proven that someone else is stupid, that doesn't mean you're smart. You could both be stupid. So congrats, you proved someone else is stupid.

So he has this idea about offensive realism. It's a way to analyze the world into national relations. And the basic idea, and I'll run it by you and see what you think, is that states, nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing power, military power. And he talks about anarchy quite a bit, in that one of these underlying assumptions of this way of viewing the world is that states are anarchic towards each other.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, that's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they operate under a lot of uncertainty. States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I disagree in that regard. And I see on your bookshelf, I think the world is a lot closer to Brave New World than it is to 1984. And I think if you look at, let's suppose China's influence in America. The influence is far more through soft power than military power. China doesn't threaten America through \"we're going to kill you.\" It's more like the infiltration of universities, TikTok, things of that nature. Maybe this would've worked before the pop culture era, but I think one of the reasons we have this kind of American hegemony isn't just a function of American military. I think it's much more a function of American popular culture. When you're exporting ideas and culture, it makes other people in other countries feel closer to you and also regard you as a friend, and also to adopt your value. It's a great way to spread propaganda.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It seems to correlate though, right? It's interesting. It's an interesting idea. What has more power, the viral spread of ideas or the power of the military? It seems that the United States is at the top of the world on both.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so it's hard to disentangle the two.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let's look at Europe. American culture is very popular in Europe in many ways, right? The best music comes out of Sweden, Swedish indie pop. They're singing in English, even though... So on and so forth. None of this is a function, maybe it's a function of post World War II to some extent, but I don't think it's a function of American bases there. I think it's a function of we're exporting our music, our TV shows, and our movies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's interesting, if the battleground will be Brave New World, the battle of ideas.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's clearly Brave New World. It's so much cheaper, and again, this is one of the dark sides of social media, to use influence than it is to use threats. I think Covid is a good example of this. So much of the pressure, yes, there was authoritarianism, but it was the fact that everyone bought into it, rightly or wrongly. But the vast majority of the population wars behind all of these things, and that was through persuasion.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But I was in the museum with them and there was a statue of Thoth, who's the Egyptian god whose head is an ibis. It's a bird with a long beak. And Thoth is the god of the moon, god of knowledge, and supposedly he invented writing. So I thought, you know what? I've always loved Ancient Egypt. I know a lot about it and especially the mythology. It'd be really cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient Egyptian Thoth statue in my house. Well, it turned out that the Egyptians also killed and mummified ibises and buried them with scribes. And a week after I went to the museum, there was an auction for an ibis mummy. And I have it now in my house, still in its bandages, overlooking my desk. And we all know it's going to come to life and peck out my eyes and write with my blood. But that is one of the recent cool additions. Another thing I have, which is like, in terms of holy crap I've made it. I have an original Patrick Nagel painting, and if people don't know the name, he's like the '80s artist. He did the Duran Duran cover. Whenever you see him in nail salons.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>First off, I'm not interviewing just random people. I'm interviewing people who are accomplished. It's not a random group. That's self-selecting for something different. But I think that people love to, and this is very understandable, love to feel seen. So if you're someone who's done something, even if you're like the best Guinea pig breeder in America, to have someone interested in your work and listen to what you're saying... because I remember every book I've written, I have friends, and I wouldn't stop talking about the person I'm writing with or the North Korea. And a certain point, I'm sure they're like, \"All right, I don't care about this anymore.\"But it takes over your brain. You know what I mean? So if you someone who has an interest or a hobby, I'm sure to some extent, maybe your friends or family are sick of talking about it or you don't want to talk about it with them. That's the private life where you could just be yourself. So I try to, and this comes from my co-authoring background. When I'm talking to people to ask the questions that they haven't heard before. There's a possibility that this actor I'm a huge fan of is going to be on my show. I don't want to spoil everything. And he's got a very specific role that he's known for. And I'm like, \"Okay, I know it's going to be annoying for you talking about this one role, but my goal is to ask questions that you aren't sick of asking, haven't been asked.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Porn star or...<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but it has certain connotations in contemporary discourse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I understand. Contemporary discourse, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So now he changed his name to Aion Skincare, A-I-O-N. That's the sense of the most sophisticated, the most diverse, and the soap is just really high quality. Another amazing company is Barrister and Man. And if I'm going to tell you to try one, it's called Cheshire. He comes out with new ones every month or so. A lot of it's miss. A lot of it's hit. Just great, great quality stuff. Another great company is Chiseled Face. They make something called Midnight Stag, which basically smells like a garage. It's one of my favorite soaps of all time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What makes for a good smell for Michael Malice?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I have 67 answers. So some of them smell-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can't convert it into words?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Some are citrusy, some are industrial, some-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So garage is more industrial.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It smells like a garage. Yeah. Midnight Stag. It smells like a garage. Some are fun. There smells that smell like other things. For example, there's a scent in my queue called Finding Scotty. It smells like Swedish Fish. Another great company is Phoenix Shaving, and they have one called Aloha Smackdown. It smells like Hawaiian Punch. They had one called Yule Ham that they made for me special. Smells like a ham. They had a ramen one, Rock and Ramen. Smells a cup of noodles. And every year they do an advent calendar where for 12 days you have a little sample of a soap and a sample of the aftershave.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm forgetting someone and I'm feeling angry that I'm doing it. But those are some of the... Oh, and Catie's Bubbles is great. They're vegan, out of New Jersey. They've got one called a Knee High to a Grape. It smells like grape soda. I think those are the biggest names off the top of my head.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Will that list converge down to a small set eventually, or no? 67 down to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, no, it's 67.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, so it always keeps [inaudible 01:27:35]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So if there's a slot, then, you know what I mean? I'll fill that. You see what I'm saying?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, so you will forever have the variety of 67?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You know how sad my brain is? When you were telling me this, I was like, \"I wonder how many soaps are left in Michael Malice's life.\" You can count your life by days, by month, by years, or by soaps.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is depressing. That is very dark.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because each experience of shaving is a little beautiful experience.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it is. It's so much fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How many do you have left in your life, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I got to tell you, there's something else. There's a term my friend Jackie taught me called Touching Pan. It's a makeup term.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, it's kind of fun. I'm telling you, people can scoff. It is such a fun... and there's a lot of us online who are into this whole space. It's really, really fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When did you first discover this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Can I curse?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Cole is one of the biggest hipsters I know. He's got the shirts with the pearl snaps and everything. And I'm staying at his house because I was doing Rogan, and he goes, \"Oh, have you heard of this wet shaving thing?\" And he goes, \"Look, this one's Proraso. That's the Italian grandpa soap, which is also a great one. And I went down this rabbit hole, and now I'm like... I don't even know how much money I spent on this.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good idea for a tattoo. Fuck you, Cole. Do you have advice on how to be happy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of loneliness and sadness in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I can give a very easy piece of advice that worked a lot for me. Instead of telling yourself that you have these ridiculous standards, tell yourself, \"I can be better. I don't have to be a great writer. I could be a better writer. I don't have to be a great podcaster. That will never happen. I could be a better podcaster. I could be a better person. I could be better at the gym. I could be better with my time.\" And when you regard things in... and especially if you have metrics that you can go by. \"I'll run this many miles a day.\" Things you have control over. Especially as males, when you have this chart and the data is telling you you're improving, right away, it's like you have this sense of accomplishment. So I think that is a really great way to... And if something is not working in your life... Let's suppose you don't have friends. Right? There's the internet. How do people make friends? Try things out? What's the worst that's going to happen? Things will blow up in your face. Well, you'll learn something at least. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. When I was a kid, I was so scared of having things under control, so like I would never have to get hit in the face metaphorically. And then I realized, and you realized this as well, everyone who's important gets hit in the face. Look at the president, whoever the president is. It becomes a matter of being strong enough that you could take getting hit in the face. So that is a big important switch in your thinking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a Bukowski quote I wrote down. \"Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I'm not going to make it. But you laugh inside, remembering all the times you felt that way.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a part of me that's like that. There's some days where I feel like this is the worst day of my life. And then shortly after, I chuckle at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just knowing the ups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all that. You ever been depressed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course. I'm more anxious than depressed. I don't really get depressed, but I've been depressed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like low points.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But I think I distinguish depression between low points, right? If things are going bad and you feel bad, that makes sense. But when I think of depression, I think of someone who feels bad when things aren't bad. To me, it's almost by definition irrational.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah. And there's different kinds of... There's a exhausted kind of depression where it's not so much sad as you don't want to do anything. You don't want to live. You don't want to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What's the point? It's a wrap, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the point? What's the point? And an extreme self-critical negativity, which I'm also scared of because my brain is generally very self-critical.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because you're not taking enough magnesium.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you take a rectally or in the mouth?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But as for the magnesium, you should take it as a pill.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Well, the way your mom explained it then is way different. What are you most afraid of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Holy crap. I am trying to think of anything I'm afraid of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In 1984-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the mission accomplished. I mean, I'm scared of increasing authoritarianism, but that's not personal.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look, I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow, I did pretty good with what I had. I think I did things that matter to me. I think I moved the needle on things that matter to me. I think I've been a good friend to the people I care about. I've saved a couple of lives. So I think it's a very low bar for someone to be able to grow their grave and say, \"I left the world a better place than I found it.\" I don't think it's that hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You ever been betrayed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh god, yes. Of course. Haven't you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not as often as I would've predicted.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The Russian upbringing expects everyone to be like... it's a time bomb before they betray you. I have been betrayed. Of course. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You value loyalty?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. And I also made it a point to not let that betrayal color my future interactions and regard that as the universal or the norm. I think that's very important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Me too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And also, I feel bad. I've gotten, Lex, enough that I feel bad for the person who betrayed me, because it's just like they didn't need to do this. And at some point, if you betray someone, you know, and you know you're not a good person. I believe that. Like even if you tell yourself, \"This is something I had to do,\" you still know you had to do a bad thing to someone who didn't deserve it. And that's a really hard pill to swallow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In my situation, I still think good thoughts and empathize with the people that have done me wrong.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't empathize with them, but I sympathize with them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>My English is not good enough to know the difference.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Empathizing means you're putting yourself in their shoes. Sympathizing means you feel bad for them and wish them well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I wish them well.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but I don't put myself... it's very hard for me to empathize with someone who betrays someone that they care about. It's not that just I think I'm such a great person. It's that I feel guilt very strongly. So if I did that to someone who trusted me, it would up my head for a long time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but maybe they were in pain. Maybe they were desperate. Maybe their back's to the wall.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They felt that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure. Well, that's a sympathy thing. Not really an empathy thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Loyalty is a fascinating thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I value trust a lot.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People are going to laugh, and I welcome it. That's fine. I really sometimes feel like the guy in American Beauty looking at the plastic bag dancing in the wind, and he's brought to tears because of how much beautiful life is. And a lot of people feel the need to sneer at that scene and Ricky Pitts, whatever, and I think he's got it exactly right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think he does too. Well, in the end, you and I will be both laughing,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. And also seeing beauty where other people see garbage.
