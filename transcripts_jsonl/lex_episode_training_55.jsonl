All right. I read that you fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration when you were five, watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. So, let me ask you to look back at the historical context and impact of that. So, the space race from 1957 to 1969 between the Soviet Union and the US was, in many ways, epic. It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events. First satellite to space, first human to space, first spacewalk, first uncrewed landing on the moon. Then, some failures, explosions, deaths on both sides actually. And then, the first human walking on the moon. What are some of the more inspiring moments or insights you take away from that time, those few years at just 12 years?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and you need a big group of people who feel that kind of satisfaction with creating that kind of beauty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of books written about you. There's a book Invent & Wander where Walter Isaacson does an intro. It's mostly collective writings of yours. I've read that. I also recommend people check out the Founders Podcast that covers you a lot and it does different analysis of different business advice you've given over the years. I bring all that up because I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote for short attention spans. And I forget how it was phrased, but that when you were thinking about the Kindle that you were thinking about how technology changes us.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Changes us. We co-evolve with our tools. So we invent new tools and then our tools change us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which is fascinating to think about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It goes in a circle<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's some aspect, even just inside business, where you don't just make the customer happy, but you also have to think about where is this going to take humanity if you zoom out a bit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>brains to be really good at processing super short form content. Your podcast flies in the face of this. You do these long format things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Books do too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>co-evolving with that tool. But I think it's important to spend some of your time and some of your life doing long attention span things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value in your own life of focus, of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time, and that's certainly what books do and that's certainly what that piece of technology does. But I bring all that up to ask you about another piece of technology, AI, that has the potential to have various trajectories to have an impact on human civilization. How do you think AI will change us?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>over the next 10 years and 20 years, I think we're going to see really remarkable advances. And I personally am very excited about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, really interesting to say that it's discoveries, that it's true that we don't know the limits of what's possible with the current language models.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there that open doors to hold entire new possibilities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and I put just in quotes because it's actually hard to scale things up, but just scaling things up also appears to pay huge dividends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And there's some more nuanced aspect about human beings that's interesting if it's able to accomplish like being truly original and novel. Large language models, being able to come up with some truly new ideas. That's one. And the other one is truth. It seems that large language models are very good at sounding like they're saying a true thing, but they don't require or often have a grounding in a mathematical truth, basically is a very good bullshitter. So if there's not enough data in the training data about a particular topic, it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives, which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve, how do you get language models to infer what is true or not to introspect?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they need to be taught to say, \"I don't know,\" more often and I know several humans who could be taught that as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. And then the other stuff, because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side with the AI things, the other open question is what kind of products are created from this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's Alexa everywhere. And guess what? Alexa is about to get a lot smarter. And so from a product point of view, that's super exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's so many opportunities there,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>accidentally contributing their corporate data to that model. And so those are the tools we're building for them with Bedrock. So there's tremendous opportunity here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the security, the privacy, all those things are fascinating. Because so much value can be gained by training on private data, but you want to keep this secure. It's a fascinating technical problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. This is a very challenging technical problem and it's one that we're making progress on and dedicated to solving for our customers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there will be a day when humans and robots, maybe Alexa, have a romantic relationship like in the movie Her?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think if you look at the-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just brainstorming products here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of human variety and what people like, sexual variety, there are people who like everything. So the answer to your question has to be yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. I guess I'm asking when-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know how widespread that will be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it will happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was just asking when for a friend, but it's all right. Moving on. Next question. What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Bezos? You're one of the most productive humans in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, first of all, I get up in the morning and I putter. I have a coffee.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you define putter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it anyway, I don't want to, and it's painful. And I'm like, \"Why am I here?\" And I don't want to do any of this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\"Why am I here at the gym?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Why am I here at the gym? Why don't I do something else?\" It's not always easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your social motivation in those moments?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in about four hours if I do it now, I'll have more energy for the rest of my day and so on and so on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your exercise routine, just to linger on that? How much you curl? What are we talking about here? That's all I do at the gym so I just...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'll be like, \"No, I don't think so.\" And he'll look at me and say, \"Yeah, I think you can.\" And of course he's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course. Of course.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's helpful to have somebody push you a little bit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But almost every day, you do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>little bit of weightlifting and I'd rotate. I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day. It's all pretty standard stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So puttering, coffee, gym-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... work. But what's work look like? What do the productive hours look like for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but it's also my least favorite part. So that's why they call it work. You don't always get to do what you want to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you achieve time where you can focus and truly think through problems?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>good. It has a kind of beauty to it. It has an aesthetic beauty to it, and you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you actually describe the crisp document? This is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon, of the way you approach meetings is this, the six-page memo. Maybe first describe the process of running a meeting with memos.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>start with a six-page narratively structured memo and we do study hall. For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together in the meeting and read.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>read it at all, and they're trying to catch up. And they're also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's better just to carve out the time for people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And do it together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>makes them really good. And you get to see their real ideas and you're not trompling on them accidentally in a big PowerPoint presentation meeting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's that feel like when you've authored a thing and then you're sitting there and everybody's reading your thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's mostly terrifying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But maybe in a good way? Like a purifying?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's terrifying in a productive way, but I think it's emotionally, a very nerve-racking experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a art, science to the writing of this six-page memo or just writing in general to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tease that thinking out of the person, and you've got it from the very beginning. So it really saves you time in the long run.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that part is crisp, and then the rest is messy. Crisp document, messy meeting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a series of metrics, every time it's the same metrics. Those meetings can be very efficient. They can start on time and end on time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we're about to run out of time, which is a good time to ask about the 10,000-Year Clock.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, that's what I'm known for, is the humor. Okay. Can you explain what the 10,000-Year Clock is?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>longer term, that won't happen for hundreds of years, but we are going to build it now and let it accrue the patina of age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out here on earth?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>States won't exist. Whole civilizations rise and fall. 10,000 years is so long. No nation state has ever survived for anywhere close to 10,000 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the increasing rate of progress makes that even fantastic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>will we have changed ourselves and what will we be and so on and so on? I don't know, but I think we'll be here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny. Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot of reasons to stay around, but mortality doesn't have that effect on me that it did maybe when I was in my twenties.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Jeff, thank you for creating Amazon, one of the most incredible companies in history, and thank you for trying your best to make humans a multi-planetary species, expanding out into our solar system, maybe beyond, to meet the aliens out there. And thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Lex, thank you for doing your part to lengthen our attention spans.
