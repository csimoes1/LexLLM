This is his first time doing a conversation of this kind and of this length. And as he told me, it felt like we could have easily talked for many more hours, and I'm sure we will.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I heard you had a lot of work to do around the ranch. So, what's the coolest job you remember doing there?<|eot_id|>"}

I've fixed windmills, and laid fences, and pipelines, and done all the things that any rancher would do, vaccinated the animals, everything. But after my grandmother died, I was about 12 and I kept coming to the ranch, so then it was just him and me, just the two of us. And he was completely addicted to the soap opera, Days of Our Lives. And we would go back to the ranch house every day around 1:00 PM or so to watch Days of Our Lives. Like sands through an hourglass, so are the Days of Our Lives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just the image of that, the two of you sitting there watching a soap opera, two ranchers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He had these big crazy dogs. It was really a very formative experience for me. But the key thing about it for me, the great gift I got from it was that my grandfather was so resourceful. He did everything himself. He made his own veterinary tools. He would make needles to suture the cattle up with. He would find a little piece of wire and heat it up and pound it thin and drill a hole in it and sharpen it. So, you learn different things on a ranch than you would learn growing up in a city.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, self-reliance?<|eot_id|>"}

New it would've cost, I don't know, more than $100,000. And we spent an entire summer repairing that bulldozer. And we'd use mail order to buy big gears for the transmission, and they'd show up, they'd be too heavy to move, so we'd have to build a crane. Just that problem-solving mentality. He had it so powerfully. He did all of his own... He didn't pick up the phone and call somebody, he would figure it out on his own. Doing his own veterinary work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But just the image of the two of you fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in for a little break at 1:00 PM to watch soap operas.<|eot_id|>"}

He was a really, really remarkable guy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also in all those westerns, when he's not doing what he's doing, he's just watching soap operas. All right. I read that you fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration when you were five, watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. So, let me ask you to look back at the historical context and impact of that. So, the space race from 1957 to 1969 between the Soviet Union and the US was, in many ways, epic. It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events. First satellite to space, first human to space, first spacewalk, first uncrewed landing on the moon. Then, some failures, explosions, deaths on both sides actually. And then, the first human walking on the moon. What are some of the more inspiring moments or insights you take away from that time, those few years at just 12 years?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>peak, that program was spending 2% or 3% of GDP on the Apollo program. So, much resource. I think it was pulled forward in time. We kind of did it ahead of when we, quote, unquote, should have done it. And so, in that way, it's also a technical marvel. I mean it's truly incredible. It's the 20th century version of building the pyramids or something. It's an achievement that because it was pulled forward in time and because it did something that had previously been thought impossible, it rightly deserves its place in the pantheon of great human achievements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, you named the rockets that Blue Origin is working on after some of the folks involved.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't understand why I didn't say New Gagarin. Is that-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm a big fan of Gagarin's though. And in fact, I think his first words in space I think are incredible. He purportedly said, \"My God, it's blue.\" And that really drives home. No one had seen the Earth from space. No one knew that we were on this blue planet. No one knew what it looked like from out there, and Gagarin was the first person to see it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things I think about is how dangerous those early days were for Gagarin, for Glenn, for everybody involved. How big of a risk they were all taking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They were taking huge risks. I'm not sure what the Soviets thought about Gagarin's flight, but I think that the Americans thought that the Alan Shepard flight, the flight that New Shepherd is named after, the First American in space, he went on his suborbital flight, they thought he had about a 75% chance of success. So, that's a pretty big risk, a 25% risk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's kind of interesting that Alan Shepard is not quite as famous as John Glenn.

And we can easily support a civilization that large with all of the resources in the solar system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, what do you think that looks like? Giant space stations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and so on, and we'll build giant O'Neill style colonies and people will live in those. They have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces. You can spin them to get normal Earth gravity. You can put them where you want them. I think most people are going to want to live near Earth, not necessarily in Earth orbit, but near Earth vicinity orbits. And so, they can move relatively quickly back and forth between their station and Earth. I think a lot of people, especially in the early stages, are not going to want to give up Earth altogether.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They go to earth for vacation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, same way that you might go to Yellowstone National Park for vacation, people will... And people will get to choose where they live on Earth or whether they live in space, but they'll be able to use much more energy and much more material resource in space than they would be able to use on Earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the interesting ideas you had is to move the heavy industry away from Earth. So, people sometimes have this idea that somehow space exploration is in conflict with the celebration of the planet Earth, that we should focus on preserving Earth. And basically, your idea is that space travel and space exploration is a way to preserve Earth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. We've sent robotic probes to all the planets, we know that this is the good one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to play favorites or anything, but...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we have as an advanced society. And we can have both, but to do that, we have to go to space. And the most fundamental measure is energy usage per capita. You do want to continue to use more and more energy, it is going to make your life better in so many ways, but that's not compatible ultimately with living on a finite planet. And so, we have to go out into the solar system. And really, you could argue about when you have to do that, but you can't credibly argue about whether you have to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Eventually we have to do that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you don't often talk about it, but let me ask you on that topic about the Blue Ring and the Orbital Reef space infrastructure projects. What's your vision for these?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>small payloads, and it provides thermal management, it provides electric power, it provides compute, provides communications. And so, when you design a payload for Blue Ring, you don't have to figure out all of those things on your own. So, kind of radiation tolerant compute is a complicated thing to do. And so, we have an unusually large amount of radiation tolerant compute on board Blue Ring, and your payload can just use that when it needs to. So, it's sort of all these services... It's like a set of APIs. It's a little bit like Amazon Web Services, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For space?<|eot_id|>"}

So, compute and space. So, you get a giant chemical rocket to get a payload out to orbit. And then, you have these admins that show up, this Blue Ring thing that manages various things like compute?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And it can also provide transportation and move you around to different orbits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Including humans, do you think?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, Blue Ring is not designed to move humans around. It's designed to move payloads around. So, we're also building a lunar lander, which is of course designed to land humans on the surface of the moon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm going to ask you about that, but let me ask you to just step back to the old days. You were at Princeton with aspirations to be a theoretical physicist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What attracted you to physics and why did you change your mind and not become... Why are you not Jeff Bezos, the famous theoretical physicist?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>canceled out, and the answer was cosine. And I said, \"Yosanta, did you do that in your head?\" And he said, \"Oh, no. That would be impossible. A few years ago I solved a similar problem and I could map this problem onto that problem, and then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosine.\" You have an experience like that, you realize maybe being a theoretical physicist isn't what the universe wants you to be. And so, I switched to computer science and that worked out really well for me. I enjoy it. I still enjoy it today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a particular kind of intuition you need to be a great physicist, and applied to physics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the mathematical skill required today is so high. You have to be a world-class mathematician to be a successful theoretical physicist today. And you probably need other skills too, intuition, lateral thinking and so on. But without just top-notch math skills, you're unlikely to be successful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And visualization skill, you have to be able to really do these kinds of thought experiments if you want truly great creativity. Actually Walter Isaacson writes about you and puts you on the same level as Einstein and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you want to boil down what I am, I'm really an inventor. And I look at things and I can come up with atypical solutions. And then, I can create 100 such atypical solutions for something, 99 of them may not survive scrutiny, but one of those 100 is like, \"Hmm, maybe that might work.\" And then, you can keep going from there. So, that kind of lateral thinking, that kind of inventiveness in a high-dimensionality space where the search space is very large, that's where my inventive skills come... I self-identify as an inventor more than anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And he describes in all kinds of different ways, Walter Isaacson does, that creativity combined with childlike wander that you've maintained still to this day, all of that combined together. If you were to study your own brain, introspect, how do you think? What's your thinking process like? We'll talk about the writing process of putting it down on paper, which is quite rigorous and famous at Amazon. But when you sit down, maybe alone, maybe with others, and thinking through this high-dimensional space and looking for creative solutions, creative paths forward, is there something you could say about that process?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>drawing to the solution. The reality is we may have to wander for a long time. And I do like group invention. I think there's really nothing more fun than sitting at a whiteboard with a group of smart people and spit balling and coming up with new ideas and objections to those ideas, and then solutions to the objections and going back and forth. So, sometimes you wake up with an idea in the middle of the night and sometimes you sit down with a group of people and go back and forth, and both things are really pleasurable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you wander, I think one key thing is to notice a good idea. And maybe to notice the kernel of a good idea. I'll maybe pull at that string. Because I don't think good ideas come fully-formed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>100% right. In fact, when I come up with what I think is a good idea and it survives the first level of scrutiny that I do in my own head, and I'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea, I will often say, \"Look, it is going to be really easy for you to find objections to this idea, but work with me.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's something there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's something there. And that is intuition, because it's really easy to kill new ideas in the beginning because there's so many easy objections to them. So, you need to kind of forewarn people and say, \"Look, I know it's going to take a lot of work to get this to a fully-formed idea. Let's get started on that. It'll be fun.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you got that ability to say cosine in you somewhere after all, maybe not on math, but-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In a different domain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

When I go around and I meet people, I'm always looking for the way that they're smart. And you find that's one of the things that makes the world so interesting and fun is that it's not like IQ is a single dimension. There are people who are smart in such unique ways.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you just gave me a good response when somebody calls me an idiot on the internet. \"You know, there's 1,000 ways to be smart, sir.\"<|eot_id|>"}

I feel like that's a Mark Twain quote. Okay. All right. You gave me an amazing tour of Blue Origin Rocket Factory and Launch Complex in the historic Cape Canaveral. That's where New Glenn, the big rocket we talked about, is being built and will launch. Can you explain what the New Glenn rocket is and tell me some interesting technical aspects of how it works?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you need to store many thousands of pounds of liquid hydrogen, your liquid hydrogen tank gets very large. So, you get more benefit from the higher ISP, the specific impulse, you get more benefit from the higher specific impulse on the second stage. And that stage carries less propellant, so you don't get such geometrically-gigantic tanks. The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle that is all hydrogen. The booster stage is also hydrogen, and I think that it's a very effective vehicle, but it never was very cost-effective. So, it's operationally very capable but not very cost-effective.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, size is also costly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Size is costly. So, it's interesting. Rockets love to be big.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>exception to this rule, and it is manufacturing. So, manufacturing large structures is very, very challenging. It's a pain in the butt. And so, if you're making a small rocket engine, you can move all the pieces by hand, you could assemble it on a table, one person can do it. You don't need cranes and heavy lift operations and tooling and so on and so on. When you start building big objects, infrastructure, civil infrastructure, just like the launchpad and all this we went and visited, I took you to the launchpad.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so, just these things become major undertakings, both from an engineering point of view, but also from a construction and cost point of view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And even the foundation of the launchpad.

The efficiency, the structural efficiency of that material is so high compared to any metallic material you might use or anything else. So that's one. Aluminum-lithium and the ability to friction stir weld aluminum-lithium. Do you remember the friction stir welding that I showed you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. It's incredible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of using heat to weld two pieces of metal together, it literally stirs the two pieces. There's a pin that rotates at a certain rate and you put that pin between the two plates of metal that you want to weld together and then you move it at a very precise speed. And instead of heating the material, it heats it a little bit because of friction, but not very much, you can literally immediately after welding with stir friction welding, you can touch the material and it's just barely warm. It literally stirs the molecules together. It's quite extraordinary.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Relatively low temperature and I guess high temperatures, that makes it a weak point.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... which is a very difficult task.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. When you need something that needs to have 100% integrity until it needs to have 0% integrity, it needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away, and then when it goes away, it has to go away completely.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Use explosives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The entirety of this thing is so badass. Okay, so we're back to the two stages. So the first stage is reusable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Second stage is expendable. Second stage is liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen.

The first stage lands down range on a landing platform in the ocean, comes back for maintenance and get ready to do the next mission.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a million questions, but also is there a path towards reusability for the second stage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is and we know how to do that. Right now, we're going to work on manufacturing that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible, two paths for a second stage, make it reusable or work really hard to make it inexpensive, so you can afford to expend it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Even in terms of ... And I'm talking about cost. Space, getting into orbit is a solved problem. We solved it back in the '50s and '60s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're making it sound easy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The only interesting problem is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit, which is, if you can do that, you open up a bunch of new endeavors that lots of start-up companies everybody else can do. One of our missions is to be part of this industry and lower the cost to orbit, so that there can be a renaissance, a golden age of people doing all kinds of interesting things in space.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I like how you said getting to orbit is a solved problem. It's just the only interesting thing is reducing the cost. You know how you can describe every single problem facing human civilization that way? The physicists would say, \"Everything is a solved problem. We've solved everything. The rest is just,\" what did Rutherford said, \"that it's just stamp collecting. It's just the details.\" Some of the greatest innovations and inventions and brilliance is in that cost reduction stage, right? And you've had a long career of cost reduction.<|eot_id|>"}

That's how the world gets richer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what are some of the biggest challenges on the manufacturing side, on the engineering side that you're facing in working to get to the first launch of New Glenn?<|eot_id|>"}

So it's one thing to build a first article, right? To launch New Glenn for the first time, you need to produce a first article, but that's not the hard part. The hard part is everything that's going on behind the scenes to build a factory that can produce New Glenns at rate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the first one is produced in a way that enables the production of the second and third and the fourth and the fifth and sixth-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but the challenge right now is driving really hard to get to is to get to rate manufacturing and to do that in an efficient way, again back to our cost point.

You can't eliminate the risk, but it is something, because it's a tourism vehicle, you have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks. And I felt very good about the system.

So yeah, for tourism rockets, safety is a huge, huge, huge priority for space exploration also, but a delta less.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. I think if you're doing ... There are human activities where we tolerate more risk if you're saving somebody's life, if you are engaging in real exploration. These are things where I personally think we would accept more risk in part because you have to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a part of you that's frustrated by the rate of progress in Blue Origin?<|eot_id|>"}

It was very important to me. I felt I had an obligation to all the stakeholders at Amazon to do that. And so having turned the CEO, I'm still the executive chair there, but I turned the CEO role over, and the primary reason I did that is that I could spend time on Blue Origin, adding some energy, some sense of urgency, \"We need to move much faster and we're going to.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the ways to speed it up?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thing at Blue Origin and will help us move faster is we're going to become the world's most decisive company. We're going to get really good at taking appropriate technology risk and making those decisions quickly, being bold on those things and having the right culture that supports that. You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious, \"If there are five ways to do something, we'll study them, but let's study them very quickly and make a decision.\" We can always change our mind. Changing your mind, I talk about one-way doors and two-way doors, most decisions are two-way doors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain that because I love that metaphor?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>down officer because somebody would be bringing me a one-way door decision and I would say, \"Okay, I can think of three more ways to analyze that.

We really have to get this one right from the beginning.\" And what happens, unfortunately, in companies, what can happen, is that you have a one-size-fits-all decision-making process where you end up using the heavyweight process on all decisions ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For everything, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Including the lightweight ones, the two-way door decisions.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There are a bunch of decisions like that are ... Changing the decision is going to be very, very complicated. Some of them are technical decisions too because some technical decisions are like quick-drying cement. Once you make them, it gets really hard. Choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle, selecting LNG for the booster stage and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage, that has turned out to be a very good decision. But if you changed your mind, that would be a very big setback. Do you see what I'm saying?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So that's the kind of decision you scrutinize very, very carefully. Other things just aren't like that.

This is also, let's say two executives who disagree and they just have a war of attrition, and whichever one gets exhausted first capitulates to the other one. Again, you haven't arrived at truth and this is very demoralizing. So this is where escalation, I try to ask people on my team and say, \"Never get to a point where you are resolving something by who gets exhausted first. Escalate that.\" I'll help you make the decision because that's so de-energized and such a terrible, lousy way to make a decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you want to get to the resolution as quickly as possible because that ultimately leads to high velocity of decision?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and you want to try to get as close to truth as possible. Exhausting the other person is not truth seeking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We're respectful of each other, but we strongly disagree with each other.

Most of what slows things down is taking too long to make decisions at all scale levels. So it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity. Amazon has a million and a half people and the company is still fast. We're still decisive, we're still quick, and that's because the culture supports that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At every scale in a distributed way-<|eot_id|>"}

The disadvantage of hydrogen has always been that since it's such a deep cryogen, it's not storable. So it's constantly boiling off and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off. And so what we're doing as part of our lunar program is developing solar-powered cryo coolers that can actually make hydrogen a storable propellant for deep space. And that's a real game-changer. It's a game-changer for any high energy mission.

The whole point of Artemis is go back to the moon, but this time to stay. So back in the Apollo program, we went to the moon six times and then ended the program and it really was too expensive to continue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's a few questions there, but one is how do you stay on the moon? What ideas do you have about sustaining life where a few folks can stay there for prolonged periods of time?<|eot_id|>"}

And we know there is ice water or water ice in those craters, and we know that we can break that down with electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. And then you'd not only have oxygen, but you'd also have a very good high efficiency propellant fuel in hydrogen. So there's a lot we can do to make the moon more sustainable over time, but the very first step, the gate that all of that has to go through is we need to be able to land cargo and humans on the surface of the moon at an acceptable cost.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To fast-forward a little bit, is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot on the moon and on Mars, one or the other or both?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's very unlikely. I think it's probably something that gets done by future generations by the time it gets to me. I think in my lifetime that's probably going to be done by professional astronauts, sadly. I would love to sign up for that mission. So don't count me out yet, Lex. Give me a finding shot here maybe, but I think if we are placing reasonable bets on such a thing, in my lifetime, that will continue to be done by professional astronauts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So these are risky, difficult missions?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And probably missions that require a lot of training. You are going there for a very specific purpose to do something. We're going to be able to do a lot on the moon too with automation. So in terms of setting up these factories and doing all that, we are sophisticated enough now with automation that we probably don't need humans to tend those factories and machines. So there's a lot that's going to be done in both modes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I have to ask the bigger picture question about the two companies pushing humanity forward out towards the stars, Blue Origin and SpaceX. Are you competitors, collaborators? Which and to what degree?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all scale levels, there are half a dozen giant companies that the internet has made, but there are a bunch of medium-sized companies and a bunch of small companies, all successful, all with profit streams, all driving great customer experiences. That's what we want to see in space, that kind of dynamism. And space is big. There's room for a bunch of winners and it's going to happen at all skill levels. And so SpaceX is going to be successful for sure. I want Blue Origin to be successful, and I hope there are another five companies right behind us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I spoke to Elon a few times recently about you, about Blue Origin, and he was very positive about you as a person and very supportive of all the efforts you've been leading at Blue. What's your thoughts? You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon at Blue. What's your thoughts about Elon as a human being and a leader?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I don't really know Elon very well. I know his public persona, but I also know you can't know anyone by their public persona. It's impossible. You may think you do, but I guarantee you don't. So I don't really know. You know Elon way better than I do, Lex, but in terms of judging by the results, he must be a very capable leader. There's no way you could have Tesla and SpaceX without being a capable leader. It's impossible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I hope you guys hang out sometimes, shake hands and sort of have a kind of friendship that would inspire just the entirety of humanity, because what you're doing is one of the big grand challenges ahead for humanity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I agree with you and I think in a lot of these endeavors we're very like-minded. So I'm not saying we're identical, but I think we're very like-minded. And so I love that idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, going back to sexy pictures on your Instagram, there's a video of you from the early days of Amazon, giving a tour of your, \"Offices.\" I think your dad is holding the camera.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He is. Yeah, I know, right? Yes. This is what? The giant orange extension cord.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're explaining the genius of the extension cord and how this is a desk and the CRT monitor, and that's where all the magic happened. I forget what your dad said, but this is the center of it all. So what was it like? What was going through your mind at that time? You left a good job in New York and took this leap. Were you excited? Were you scared?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at the same time. You're holding that contradiction in your head. But it was so exciting. From 1994 when the company was founded to 1995 when we opened our doors, all the way until today, I find Amazon so exciting. And that doesn't mean... It's full of pain, full of problems. It's like there's so many things that need to be resolved and worked and made better and et cetera. But on balance, it's so fun. It's such a privilege. It's been such a joy. I feel so grateful that I've been part of that journey. It's just been incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some sense, you don't want a single day of comfort. You've written about this many times. We'll talk about your writing, which I would highly recommend people read and just the letters to shareholders. So explaining the idea of day one thinking, I think you first wrote about in 97 letters to shareholders. Then you also in a way wrote it about, sad to say, is your last letter to shareholders as CEO. And you said that, \"Day two is stasis followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death.\" And that is why it's always day one. Can you explain this day one thing? This is a really powerful way to describe the beginning and the journey of Amazon.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are. And one of the things that we do is we put, \"These are the tenets for this program and parentheses.\" We always put, \"Unless you know a better way.\" And that idea, \"Unless you know a better way,\" is so important because you never want to get trapped by dogma. You never want to get trapped by history. It doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it. There's so much value in what has worked in the past, but you can't be blindly following what you've done. And that's the heart of day one, is you're always starting afresh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to the question of how to fend off day two, you said, \"Such a question can't have a simple answer,\" as you're saying. \"There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don't know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here's a starter pack of essentials, maybe others come to mind. For day one, defense, customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends and high velocity decision-making.\" So we talked about high velocity decision-making, that's more difficult than it sounds. So maybe you can pick one that stands out to you as you can comment on. Eager adoption of external trends, high velocity decision-making, skeptical view of proxies. How do you fight off day two?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a million units, how many customer contacts do you get or how many returns do you get? And so on and so on. And so what happens is a little bit of a kind of inertia sets in where somebody a long time ago invented that metric and they invented that metric, they decided, \"We need to watch for customer returns per unit sold as an important metric.\" But they had a reason why they chose that metric, the person who invented that metric and decided it was worth watching. And then fast-forward five years, that metric is the proxy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The proxy for truth, I guess.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>customer happiness and this metric is worth putting energy into and following and improving and scrutinizing, only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness.\" And so you've got to constantly be on guard and it's very, very common. This is a nuanced problem. It's very common, especially in large companies, that they're managing to metrics that they don't really understand. They don't really know why they exist, and the world may have shifted out from under them a little and the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were when somebody 10 years earlier invented the metric.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That is a nuance, but that's a big problem. Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a huge problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's something so compelling to have a nice metric to try to optimize.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. And by the way, you do need metrics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, you do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can't ignore them. Want them, but you just have to be constantly on guard. This is a way to slip into day two thinking would be to manage your business to metrics that you don't really understand and you're not really sure why they were invented in the first place, and you're not sure they're still as relevant as they used to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does it take to be the guy or gal who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated? I guess what does it take to have a culture that enables that in the meeting? Because that's a very uncomfortable thing to bring up at a meeting. \"We all showed up here, it's a Friday.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have just asked a million-dollar question. So if I generalize what you're asking, you are talking in general about truth-telling and we humans are not really truth-seeking animals. We are social animals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And take you back in time 10,000 years and you're in a small village. If you go along to get along, you can survive. You can procreate. If you're the village truth-teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night. Truths are often... They don't want to be heard because important truths can be uncomfortable, they can be awkward, they can be exhausting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Impolite and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's uncomfortable.\" Literally tell people, \"It's not what we're designed to do as humans.\" It's kind of a side effect. We can do that, but it's not how we survive. We mostly survive by being social animals and being cordial and cooperative, and that's really important. And so science is all about truth-telling. It's actually a very formal mechanism for trying to tell the truth. And even in science, you find that it's hard to tell the truth. Even you're supposed to have hypothesis and test it and find data and reject the hypothesis and so on, it's not easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But even in science, there's like the senior scientists and the junior scientists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's a hierarchy of humans where somehow seniority matters in the scientific process, which it should not.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thinks that, I came in this meeting thinking one thing, but maybe I'm not right.\" And so you can do little things like if you're the most senior person in the room, go last, let everybody else go first. In fact, ideally, let's try to have the most junior person go first and the second and try to go in order of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion in an unfiltered way. Because we really do, we actually literally change our opinions. If somebody who you really respect says something, it makes you change your mind a little.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're saying implicitly or explicitly, give permission for people to have a strong opinion, as long as it's backed by data.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can actually know whether it's right. But for now, let's not disregard it. It feels right.\" You can also fight inherent bias. There's an optimism bias. If there are two interpretations of a new set of data and one of them is happy and one of them is unhappy, it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation is right. You may want to compensate for that human bias of trying to find the silver lining and say, \"Look, that might be good, but I'm going to go with it's bad for now until we're sure.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So speaking of happiness bias, data collection and anecdotes, you have to... How's that for a transition? You have to tell me the story of the call you made, the customer service call you made to demonstrate a point about wait times?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. This is very early in the history of Amazon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The wait time was supposed to be less than 60 seconds, but we had a lot of complaints that it was longer than that. And anecdotally it seemed longer than that. I would call customer service myself. And so one day we're in a meeting, we're going through the WBR, the weekly business review, and we get to this metric in the deck, and the guy who leads customer service is defending the metric. And I said, \"Okay, let's call.\" Picked up the phone, and I dialed the 1-800 number and called customer service, and we just waited in silence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did it turn out to be?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, it was really long, more than 10 minutes, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was many minutes. And so it dramatically made the point that something was wrong with the data collection. We weren't measuring the right thing, and that set off a whole chain of events where we started measuring it right. And that's an example, by the way, of truth-telling is like that's an uncomfortable thing to do, but you have to seek truth even when it's uncomfortable, and you have to get people's attention and they have to buy into it, and they have to get energized around really fixing things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that speaks to the obsession with the customer experience. So one of the defining aspects of your approach to Amazon is just being obsessed with making customers happy. I think companies sometimes say that, but Amazon is really obsessed with that. I think there's something really profound to that, which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer, like the customer experience, the human being that's using the product, that's enjoying the product, the subtle little things that make up their experience. How do you optimize those?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hard to focus on. But in addition to that, there are all these little tiny customer experience deficiencies, and we call those paper cuts. We make long lists of them. And then we have dedicated teams that go fix paper cuts because the teams working on the big issues never get to the paper cuts. They never work their way down the list to get to... They're working on big things, as they should and as you want them to. And so you need special teams who are charged with fixing... Special teams who are charged with fixing paper cuts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where would you put on the paper cut spectrum the Buy now with the 1-Click button? Which is, I think, pretty genius. So to me, okay, my interaction with things I love on the internet, there's things I do a lot. I, maybe representing a regular human, I would love for those things to be frictionless. For example, booking airline tickets, just saying. But it's buying a thing with one click, making that experience frictionless, intuitive, all aspects of that, that just fundamentally makes my life better, not just in terms of efficiency, in terms of some kind of-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Cognitive load.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... Yeah, cognitive load and inner peace and happiness. Because, first of all, buying stuff is a pleasant experience. Having enough money to buy a thing and then buying it is a pleasant experience. And having pain around that is somehow just you're ruining a beautiful experience. And I guess all I'm saying as a person who loves good ideas, is that a paper cut, a solution to a paper cut?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. So that particular thing is probably a solution to a number of paper cuts. So if you go back and look at our order pipeline and how people shopped on Amazon before we invented 1-Click shopping, there was more friction. There was a whole series of paper cuts and that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts. And I think you're absolutely right by the way, that when you come up with something like 1-Click shopping, again, this is so ingrained in people now, I'm impressed that you even notice it. Most people-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Every time I click the button, I just-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... most people never notice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... just a surge of happiness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is in the perfect invention for the perfect moment in the perfect context, there is real beauty. It is actual beauty and it feels good. It's emotional. It's emotional for the inventor, it's emotional for the team that builds it. It's emotional for the customer. It's a big deal and you can feel those things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But to keep coming up with that idea, with those kinds of ideas, I guess is the day one thinking effort.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and you need a big group of people who feel that kind of satisfaction with creating that kind of beauty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of books written about you. There's a book Invent & Wander where Walter Isaacson does an intro. It's mostly collective writings of yours. I've read that. I also recommend people check out the Founders Podcast that covers you a lot and it does different analysis of different business advice you've given over the years. I bring all that up because I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote for short attention spans. And I forget how it was phrased, but that when you were thinking about the Kindle that you were thinking about how technology changes us.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Changes us. We co-evolve with our tools. So we invent new tools and then our tools change us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which is fascinating to think about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It goes in a circle<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's some aspect, even just inside business, where you don't just make the customer happy, but you also have to think about where is this going to take humanity if you zoom out a bit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the little blocks moving and you're kind of rotating them in your mind and you can just tell as you walk around the world that you have rewired your brain to play Tetris. But that happens with everything. I think we still have yet to see the full repercussions of this, I fear, but I think one of the things that we've done online and largely because of social media is we have trained our brains to be really good at processing super short form content. Your podcast flies in the face of this. You do these long format things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Books do too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>something is convenient, we do more of it. We carry around in our pocket a phone, and one of the things that phone does for the most part is it is an attention shortening device because most of the things we do on our phone shorten our attention spans. And I'm not even going to say we know for sure that that's bad, but I do think it's happening. That's one of the ways we're co-evolving with that tool. But I think it's important to spend some of your time and some of your life doing long attention span things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value in your own life of focus, of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time, and that's certainly what books do and that's certainly what that piece of technology does. But I bring all that up to ask you about another piece of technology, AI, that has the potential to have various trajectories to have an impact on human civilization. How do you think AI will change us?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>agency and there's a lot of things would have to happen, but there's so much benefit that's going to come from these technologies in the meantime, even before there are general AI in terms of better medicines and better tools to develop more technologies and so on. So I think it's an incredible moment to be alive and to witness the transformations that are going to happen. How quickly will happen, no one knows. But over the next 10 years and 20 years, I think we're going to see really remarkable advances. And I personally am very excited about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, really interesting to say that it's discoveries, that it's true that we don't know the limits of what's possible with the current language models.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there that open doors to hold entire new possibilities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as much data. So self-driving cars, they have to drive billions and billions of miles to try to learn how to drive. And your average 16-year-old figures it out with many fewer miles. So there are still some tricks, I think, that we have yet to learn. I don't think we've learned the last trick. I don't think it's just a question of scaling things up. But what's interesting is that just scaling things up, and I put just in quotes because it's actually hard to scale things up, but just scaling things up also appears to pay huge dividends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And there's some more nuanced aspect about human beings that's interesting if it's able to accomplish like being truly original and novel. Large language models, being able to come up with some truly new ideas. That's one. And the other one is truth. It seems that large language models are very good at sounding like they're saying a true thing, but they don't require or often have a grounding in a mathematical truth, basically is a very good bullshitter. So if there's not enough data in the training data about a particular topic, it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives, which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve, how do you get language models to infer what is true or not to introspect?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they need to be taught to say, \"I don't know,\" more often and I know several humans who could be taught that as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. And then the other stuff, because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side with the AI things, the other open question is what kind of products are created from this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, so many. We have Alexa and Echo and Alexa has hundreds of millions of installed base inputs. And so there's Alexa everywhere. And guess what? Alexa is about to get a lot smarter. And so from a product point of view, that's super exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's so many opportunities there,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So many opportunities. Shopping assistant, all that stuff is amazing. And AWS, we're building Titan, which is our foundational model. We're also building Bedrock, which are corporate clients at AWS. Our enterprise clients, they want to be able to use these powerful models with their own corporate data without accidentally contributing their corporate data to that model. And so those are the tools we're building for them with Bedrock. So there's tremendous opportunity here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the security, the privacy, all those things are fascinating. Because so much value can be gained by training on private data, but you want to keep this secure. It's a fascinating technical problem.<|eot_id|>"}

Moving on. Next question. What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Bezos? You're one of the most productive humans in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, first of all, I get up in the morning and I putter. I have a coffee.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you define putter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as you might think I am. Because I do believe in wandering and I read my phone for a while. I read newspapers for a while. I chat with Laura and I drink my first coffee. So I move pretty slowly in the first couple of hours. I get up early just naturally, and then I exercise most days. Most days it's not that hard for me. Some days it's really hard and I do it anyway, I don't want to, and it's painful. And I'm like, \"Why am I here?\" And I don't want to do any of this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\"Why am I here at the gym?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Why am I here at the gym? Why don't I do something else?\" It's not always easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your social motivation in those moments?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>alert. I don't feel as good. And then there's harder motivations. It's longer term, you want to be healthy as you age. You want health span. Ideally, you want to be healthy and moving around when you're 80 years old. And so there's a lot of... But that kind of motivation is so far in the future, it can be very hard to work in the second. So thinking about the fact I'll feel better in about four hours if I do it now, I'll have more energy for the rest of my day and so on and so on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your exercise routine, just to linger on that? How much you curl? What are we talking about here? That's all I do at the gym so I just...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My routine on a good day, I do about half an hour of cardio and I do about forty-five minutes of weightlifting, resistance training of some kind, mostly weights. I have a trainer who I love who pushes me, which is really helpful. He'll say, \"Jeff, can we go up on that weight a little bit?\" And I'll think about it and I'll be like, \"No, I don't think so.\" And he'll look at me and say, \"Yeah, I think you can.\" And of course he's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course. Of course.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's helpful to have somebody push you a little bit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But almost every day, you do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Almost every day, I do a little bit of cardio and a little bit of weightlifting and I'd rotate. I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day. It's all pretty standard stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So puttering, coffee, gym-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... work. But what's work look like? What do the productive hours look like for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there. So my day of work, reading documents, having meetings, sometimes in person, sometimes over Zoom, depends on where I am. It's all about the technology, it's about the organization. I have architecture and technology meetings almost every day on various subsystems inside the vehicle, inside the engines. It's super fun for me. My favorite part of it is the technology. My least favorite part of it is building organizations and so on. That's important, but it's also my least favorite part. So that's why they call it work. You don't always get to do what you want to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you achieve time where you can focus and truly think through problems?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>believe in wandering. My perfect meeting starts with a crisp document. So the document should be written with such clarity that it's like angels singing from on high. I like a crisp document and a messy meeting. And so the meeting is about asking questions that nobody knows the answer to and trying to wander your way to a solution. And when that happens just right, it makes all the other meetings worthwhile. It feels good. It has a kind of beauty to it. It has an aesthetic beauty to it, and you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you actually describe the crisp document? This is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon, of the way you approach meetings is this, the six-page memo. Maybe first describe the process of running a meeting with memos.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Meetings at Amazon and Blue Origin are unusual. When new people come in, like a new executive joins, they're a little taken aback sometimes because the typical meeting, we'll start with a six-page narratively structured memo and we do study hall. For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together in the meeting and read.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Take notes in the margins. And then we discuss. And the reason, by the way, we do study, you could say, I would like everybody to read these memos in advance, but the problem is people don't have time to do that. And they end up coming to the meeting having only skimmed the memo or maybe not read it at all, and they're trying to catch up. And they're also bluffing like they were in college having pretended to do the reading.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's better just to carve out the time for people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And do it together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's why I save all that time. You also get, if the person who's preparing the memo, we talked earlier about group think and the fact that I go last in meetings and that you don't want your ideas to pollute the meeting prematurely, the author of the memos has got to be very vulnerable. They've got to put all their thoughts out there and they've got to go first. But that's great because it makes them really good. And you get to see their real ideas and you're not trompling on them accidentally in a big PowerPoint presentation meeting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's that feel like when you've authored a thing and then you're sitting there and everybody's reading your thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's mostly terrifying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But maybe in a good way? Like a purifying?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's terrifying in a productive way, but I think it's emotionally, a very nerve-racking experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a art, science to the writing of this six-page memo or just writing in general to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and nouns. That's the other problem with PowerPoint presentations, they're often just bullet points. And you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking behind bullet points. When you have to write in complete sentences with narrative structure, it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking. So it forces the author to be at their best, and so they're somebody's really their best thinking. And then you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to tease that thinking out of the person, and you've got it from the very beginning. So it really saves you time in the long run.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that part is crisp, and then the rest is messy. Crisp document, messy meeting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so you don't want to pretend that the discussion should be crisp. Most meetings, you're trying to solve a really hard problem. There's a different kind of meeting, which we call weekly business reviews or business reviews that may be weekly or monthly or daily, whatever they are. But these business review meetings, that's usually for incremental improvement. And you're looking at a series of metrics, every time it's the same metrics. Those meetings can be very efficient. They can start on time and end on time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we're about to run out of time, which is a good time to ask about the 10,000-Year Clock.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, that's what I'm known for, is the humor. Okay. Can you explain what the 10,000-Year Clock is?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>years is a tough timeframe for most institutions to think past. And we probably need to stretch that to 10 years and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years, and we'd do a better job for our children or our grandchildren if we could stretch those thinking horizons. And so the clock, in a way, it's an art project, it's a symbol. And if it ever has any power to influence people to think longer term, that won't happen for hundreds of years, but we are going to build it now and let it accrue the patina of age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out here on earth?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so. But the United States won't exist. Whole civilizations rise and fall. 10,000 years is so long. No nation state has ever survived for anywhere close to 10,000 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the increasing rate of progress makes that even fantastic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Even less likely so. Do I think humans will be here? Yes. How will we have changed ourselves and what will we be and so on and so on? I don't know, but I think we'll be here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny. Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as long as possible, but I'm really more focused on health span. I want to be healthy. I want that square wave. I want to be healthy, healthy, healthy, and then gone. I don't want the long decay. And I'm curious. I want to see how things turn out. I'd like to be here. I love my family and my close friends, and I'm curious about them, and I want to see. So I have a lot of reasons to stay around, but mortality doesn't have that effect on me that it did maybe when I was in my twenties.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Jeff, thank you for creating Amazon, one of the most incredible companies in history, and thank you for trying your best to make humans a multi-planetary species, expanding out into our solar system, maybe beyond, to meet the aliens out there. And thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
