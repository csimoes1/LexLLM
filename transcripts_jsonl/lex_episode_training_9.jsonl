This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends, here's Rick Spence. You have written and lectured about serial killers, secret societies, cults and intelligence agencies. So we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics, but let's begin with intelligence agencies. Which has been the most powerful intelligence agency in history?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or not Lenin was an Okhrana agent. Okay, I've just said heresy. I'll do that quite often. I am a heretic and proud of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it raises the question to me as to what degree there were people within the organization who allowed events to take the course they wished.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I always wonder how much deliberate planning there is within an organization like Okhrana or if there's kind of a distributed intelligence that happens.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you've got different levels, different compartments within it. Who's actually running the show, if anyone is, I don't know. That's never supposed to be apparent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's a fascinating question. You could see this with NKVD. It's obviously an extremely powerful organization that starts to eat itself, where everybody's pointing fingers internally also as a way to gain more power. So the question is in organizations like that that are so-called compartmentalized, where's the power? Where's the center of power? Because you would think given that much power, some individual or a group of individuals will start accumulating that power. But it seems like that's not always a trivial thing because if you get too powerful, the snake eats that person.<|eot_id|>"}

You mentioned that the various Russian intelligence agencies were good at creating agent provocateurs infiltrating the halls of power. What does it take to do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Faithful.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>who is sitting across from you to which you have sworn your loyalty, you're simultaneously betraying. What a rush that must be for some people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder how many people are susceptible to this.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of these things, certain amount of money, ego and a little push of coercion that if you don't, we'll rat you out.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back to something that I think the British observed was that countries don't have friends, they have interests, and those interests can change over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, the CIA is probably equally suspicious of all other nations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be trusting. Yeah. The basic job of an intelligence agency is to safeguard your secrets and steal the other guys' and then hide those away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are there laws, either intelligence agencies that they're not willing to break? Is it basically lawless operation to where you can break any law as long as it accomplishes the task?<|eot_id|>"}

You have to be able to do those things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder how often those intelligence agencies in the 20th century, and of course the natural question extending it to the 21st century, how often they go to the assassination, how often they go to the kill part of that versus just the espionage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you get someone to put a gun to someone's head and pull the trigger and then not remember it later. Yeah, you could, interestingly enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So non-direct violence, controlling people's minds, controlling people's minds at scale and experimenting with different kinds of ways of doing that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>rest is that you were having medical experiments essentially being carried out on people without their knowledge and against their will, which is a no-no.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The fact that you're willing to do medical experiments says something about what you're willing to do. And I'm sure that same spirit, innovative spirit, persists to this day. And maybe less so, I hope less so, in the United States, but probably in other intelligence agencies in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can funnel that money into the hands of people who will carry out this research privately. So if something goes wrong, you have perfect deniability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the topic of MICE, on the topic of money, ideology, coercion and ego, let me ask you about a conspiracy theory. So there is a conspiracy theory that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein. At a high level, if you can just talk about that, is that something that's at all even possible? That you have, basically this will be for coercion, you get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous and then you collect evidence on them so that you can then have leverage on them.<|eot_id|>"}

But I do not understand it and my study of it is a personal error to try to understand why people do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there are so many reasons, primary of which I would say is the desire in the human heart to belong. And, the dark forms that takes throughout human history. Recent history is something I'd love to talk to you a bit about. If we can go back to the beginning of the 20th century on the German side, you've described how secret societies like The Thule Society lay the foundation for Nazi ideology. Can you, through that lens, from that perspective, describe the rise of the Nazi party?<|eot_id|>"}

The occult was part of the picture, occult racial theories. So, there's a racial component, like the Aryan race, so it's not just the nation of Germany.

So this whole narrative that I would say is a viral meme started, as you described, in 300 BC.

And there's something about the idea that there's a cabal of people, whatever they are, in this case, our discussion is Jews seeking world domination, controlling everybody is somehow a compelling story. It gives us a direction of a people to fight, of a people to hate on which we project our pain, because life is difficult. Life for most is full of suffering. And so we channel that suffering into hatred towards the other. Maybe if you can just zoom out, what do you, from this particular discussion, learn about human nature that we pick the other in this way? We divide each other up in groups and then construct stories. And we like constructing those stories, and they become really viral and sexy to us.

Speaking of the tipping point, you gave a series of lectures on murderers, crimes in the 20th century.

Well, creepy crawling maybe. But it doesn't seem like the murder... Like some of the other people you've covered like the Zodiac Killer, the murder is the goal. Maybe there's some psychopathic artistry to the murder that the Zodiac Killer had and the messaging behind that.

With a cult, usually you have either an ideology or you have maybe personal relations, like you said, sex and drugs. But underneath that, can you really keep people with sex and drugs?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're essentially making sacrificial victims, and they will be your ghostly servants in the afterlife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think he actually believed that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're toying with the press. I mean, this goes all the way back to Jack the Ripper.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the things that they'd found.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Could they be connected? Yes. There's nothing. Don't ever tell me that something is just too crazy for people to do because that's crazy talk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've studied secret societies. You gave a lot of amazing lectures on secret societies. It's fascinating to look at human history through the lens of secret societies because they've permeated all of human history. You've talked about from everything from the Knights Templar to Illuminati, Freemasons, like we brought up. Freemasons lasted a long time. Illuminati, you've talked about in its sort of main form, lasted a short time, but its legend.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Never gone away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Never gone away. So maybe Illuminati is a really interesting one. What was that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The symbol of the order was an owl, which interestingly enough is almost identical to the owl which is the emblem of the Bohemian Club.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, boy.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one does. You can notice that it's like Papal bans on Freemasonry. They just go on and on and on because this clearly isn't working.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you actually highlight, speaking of publicity, that there's a difference between visibility and transparency. That a secret society could be visible, it could be known about, it could be quite popular, but you could still have a secrecy within it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>set a black box on this table, we can see that there is a black box. What's in the black box? A cat?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that it ceased when it was banned in Bavaria because everybody just scatters and goes elsewhere like Paris. And then you have the French Revolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the idea of the Illuminati to put it crudely, the branding is a really powerful one. And so it makes sense that there's a thread connecting it to this day that a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies can adopt the branding.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Anybody can call it. You can go out and form a club, and call it the Illuminati.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you are effective at it, I think it does attract. It's the chicken or the egg. But powerful people tend to have gigantic egos, and people with gigantic egos tend to like the exclusivity of secret societies. And so it's a gravitational force that pulls powerful people to these societies. It's exclusive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>certain. And you also notice something goes back to when we were talking about much earlier when we were talking about intelligence. Remember MEIS? Ego.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ego, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Ease of recruitment and control. That's a great Achilles heel in human beings, the exploitation of ego.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, if we go back to the conversation of intelligence agencies, it would be very efficient and beneficial for intelligence agencies to infiltrate the secret societies because that's where the powerful people are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or the secret societies to infiltrate the intelligence agencies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh boy.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the organization that knows things. We collect information, we know the secrets, we guard the secrets. Therefore, if we tell you, you must believe us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I have this sense that there are very powerful secret societies operating today, and we don't really know or understand them. And the conspiracy theories in spirit might have something to them but are actually factually not correct.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it comes down to. They weren't really humans. There's some sort of evil contamination which we must eradicate.

And once you solve them that you have this beautiful utopia where everything would be just perfect, it'd be great, and we can just get there. And I think it's really strong belief in a global utopia. It just never goes right. It seems like impossible to know the truth in it.<|eot_id|>"}
