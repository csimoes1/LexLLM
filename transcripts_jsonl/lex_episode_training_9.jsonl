This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends, here's Rick Spence. You have written and lectured about serial killers, secret societies, cults and intelligence agencies. So we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics, but let's begin with intelligence agencies. Which has been the most powerful intelligence agency in history?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>up living the last part of his life in exile in Moscow, but they got their money's worth out of him. You can also find this in KGB infiltration, the CIA, the FBI, the Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanson cases. Of course, we were infiltrating. By we, I mean the Americans in the West managed to infiltrate our moles as well. But if it came down, someone could dispute this. But I would think if you were going to come down to kind of like who had the most moles Super Bowl, probably the Soviets would come somewhat ahead of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the scale of the infiltration, the number of people and the skill of it, is there a case to be made that the Okhrana and the Chaka orchestrated both the components of the Russian Revolution as you described them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's an interesting question for me. There are all kinds of questions about this. One of the questions is whether or not Lenin was an Okhrana agent. Okay, I've just said heresy. I'll do that quite often. I am a heretic and proud of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>own game. That game took them in a direction, which meant that continued loyalty to the emperor, specifically to Nicholas II, was no longer part of that. To me, in a way, it seems almost during the events of 1917, that one, you had an organization that was very effective that suddenly just becomes ineffective. It doesn't really disappear. These things don't go away because it will reappear as the O'Chacka basically fairly quickly. But it raises the question to me as to what degree there were people within the organization who allowed events to take the course they wished.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I always wonder how much deliberate planning there is within an organization like Okhrana or if there's kind of a distributed intelligence that happens.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was that at one point early on, they actually organized the assassination of their own boss. They have their agents among the revolutionaries kill the Minister of the Interior. He'll just replaced by another one. He's an Imperial bureaucrat. He's not really part of their organization. It's like a director of an intelligence agency appointed by the president. Maybe he's part of the organization, maybe he isn't. Maybe he is not one of us. So you've got different levels, different compartments within it. Who's actually running the show, if anyone is, I don't know. That's never supposed to be apparent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's a fascinating question. You could see this with NKVD. It's obviously an extremely powerful organization that starts to eat itself, where everybody's pointing fingers internally also as a way to gain more power. So the question is in organizations like that that are so-called compartmentalized, where's the power? Where's the center of power? Because you would think given that much power, some individual or a group of individuals will start accumulating that power. But it seems like that's not always a trivial thing because if you get too powerful, the snake eats that person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fellow Genrikh Yagoda, and Yagoda will really manage things from behind the scenes until Menzhinsky dies in 1930. Then Yagoda will hold on until he's the victim of the purges, I think in 37 or 38. Yagoda is ambitious, murderous, and if I was going to point the finger to anybody who possibly had Dzerzhinsky whacked, it would be him. For the purposes simply of advancement. The person to look out at any kind of corporate organization is your immediate subordinate, the person who could move into your job, because more than likely, that's exactly what they're planning to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just one step away from the very top, somebody there will probably accumulate the most power. You mentioned that the various Russian intelligence agencies were good at creating agent provocateurs infiltrating the halls of power. What does it take to do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>who's a disgruntled communist because there's no anti-communist like an ex-communist. Those who lose the faith can become very, very useful. For instance, if you look in the case of American intelligence, the people who essentially temporarily destroyed much of the KGB organization in the US post-World War II, where people like Whitaker Chambers, Louis Budenz, Elizabeth Bentley, all of those people had been Communist party members. They had all been part of the Red Faithful. They all, for one reason or another, became disillusioned and turned rat or patriot, whichever case you may want to put in that regard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does the C in the E stand for?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>ego that was the most important in his career of treason, I'd go with ego. I think that figures into a lot. Someone doesn't get the promotions that they wanted. Again, if you look at something like Aldrich Ames career in particular, you've got these ... his career in the CIA was hit or miss. He didn't get the postings or promotions that he wanted his evaluation. He never felt that he got credit for doing that. That's the type of thing that tends to stick in someone's craw and can lead for egotistical reasons an added incentive to betray.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that there's a boost to the ego when you can deceive, sort of not play by the rules of the world and just play with powerful people like they're your pawns.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're the only one that knows this. You're only the only one that knows that the person who is sitting across from you to which you have sworn your loyalty, you're simultaneously betraying. What a rush that must be for some people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder how many people are susceptible to this. I would like to believe that the people, a lot of people have the integrity to at least withstand the money and the ideology, the pull of that and the ego.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It can also be a combination of the two. You can create a recipe of these things, certain amount of money, ego and a little push of coercion that if you don't, we'll rat you out. You'll be exposed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some differences to you as we look at the history of the 20th century between the Russian intelligence and the American intelligence in the CIA?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>answerable to the same people. So that gives you a certain greater amount, I think, of leeway and power because you're controlling both of those ends. I remember somebody telling me once that, and he was a retired KGB officer. There you go, retired. One of the things that he found amusing was that in his role, one of the things that he could be is that he could be anywhere at any time in any dress, which meant that he could be in or out of uniform and any place at any time. He was authorized to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So more freedom, more power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>would find on the Russian or Soviet side of the equations. The other aspect of that is that Russian history is long and contentious and bloody. One of the things it certainly teaches you never trust foreigners. Every foreign government anywhere, any country on your border is a real or potential enemy. They will all, at some point, if given the chance, invade you. Therefore, they must always be treated with great suspicion. It goes back to something that I think the British observed was that countries don't have friends, they have interests, and those interests can change over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, the CIA is probably equally suspicious of all other nations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's your job. You're supposed to be suspicious. Your job is not to be trusting. Yeah, the basic job of an intelligence- ... your job is not to be trusting. Yeah. The basic job of an intelligence agency is to safeguard your secrets and steal the other guys' and then hide those away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are there laws, either intelligence agencies that they're not willing to break? Is it basically lawless operation to where you can break any law as long as it accomplishes the task?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to lie convincingly is good. It's one of the things you need to do. And killing also is generally frowned upon. Put people in prison for that, they're otherwise executed. But in certain circumstances, killing is one of those things that you need to be able to do. So what he felt he was being told in that case is that once you enter this realm, the same sort of moral rules that apply in general British society do not apply. And if you're squeamish about it, you won't fit in. You have to be able to do those things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder how often those intelligence agencies in the 20th century, and of course the natural question extending it to the 21st century, how often they go to the assassination, how often they go to the kill part of that versus just the espionage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>memories or erase memories. To me, the important part is they thought they could and they were going to try to do it. And that eventually is what you find out in the efforts made during the 1950s and '60s through MKUltra, MKSearch, MKNaomi and all the others that came out. That's one of the things they're working for. And among the few MKUltra era documents that survived, there's that whole question is that could you get someone to put a gun to someone's head and pull the trigger and then not remember it later. Yeah, you could, interestingly enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So non-direct violence, controlling people's minds, controlling people's minds at scale and experimenting with different kinds of ways of doing that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was a completely different person. You can just imagine the possibilities that you can dream up. And again, it's not, I think, the question is to whether that is possible or whether it was done, although I suspect that both of those are true, but that you would try to do it. Then imagine the mischief that comes out of that. And one of the big complaints from a legal standpoint about MKUltra and the rest is that you were having medical experiments essentially being carried out on people without their knowledge and against their will, which is a no-no.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The fact that you're willing to do medical experiments says something about what you're willing to do. And I'm sure that same spirit, innovative spirit, persists to this day. And maybe less so, I hope less so, in the United States, but probably in other intelligence agencies in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to dump this stuff because there's all kinds of, because you are committing crimes against American citizens, so let's eradicate it. And the important lesson to be learned is that never do these type of thing again where at least in any way in which the agency's direct fingerprints are placed on it. You can pay people. You can subsidize research. You can set up venture capital firms. You got plenty of money and you can funnel that money into the hands of people who will carry out this research privately. So if something goes wrong, you have perfect deniability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the topic of MICE, on the topic of money, ideology, coercion and ego, let me ask you about a conspiracy theory. So there is a conspiracy theory that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein. At a high level, if you can just talk about that, is that something that's at all even possible? That you have, basically this will be for coercion, you get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous and then you collect evidence on them so that you can then have leverage on them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, let's look at what Epstein was doing. He was a businessman who then also developed a very lucrative sideline in being a high-level procurer basically in supplying young girls. And he also filmed much of that activity. I think his partner in this, Ghislaine, and I'm hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it's Ghislaine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Ghislaine?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>perversion, he's now collecting information that could be useful. Who could that be useful to? Who would like dirt on Prince Andrew? Think of all the people who were there and there were important people who went to Lolita Island. So if it isn't Epstein directly, he might have been being, I'm not trying to let him off the hook because they have anything for him, he was either running his own blackmail business or someone was using him as a front for that. I think we're kidding ourselves if we're trying to pretend that's not what was going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you think, EU and American intelligence agencies would be willing to swoop in and take advantage of a situation like that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, you know-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just in the case.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He can never tell what some crazy president might do. It could be very, one of the guys who understood was J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover spent a long time collecting dossiers on politicians. How do you think he'd remain director of the FBI as long as he did? Because he systematically collected dirt on people. So there is a history of this type of thing. And again, you could argue that's partly for his protection, to keep his job, to protect the sanctity and security of the Bureau. You can find a million different ways to justify that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really dark.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there is that side to human nature, let's put it that way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Whether it's the CIA or the Okhrana, maybe that's what the President of the United States sees when they show up to office is all this stuff they have on him or her and say that there's a internal mechanism of power that you don't want to mess with and so you will listen, whether that internal mechanism of power is the military industrial complex or whatever, the bureaucracy of government.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Contacts with the deep state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The deep state.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Entrenched, bureaucratic. Well, it's been said and I think it's generally true, that bureaucratic creatures are like any other creatures. It basically exists to perpetuate itself and to grow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they get these ideas from? So let's ask ourselves, do pedophiles exist? Yeah. Do organized pedophile organizations exist? Yeah, they share information, pictures, they're out there on the dark web, they cooperate. So does child trafficking exist? Yeah, it does. So in other words, whether or not specific conspiracy theories about this or that group of organized pedophile cultists is real, all the ingredients for that to be real are there. Pedophiles exist, organized pedophilia exists, child and human trafficking exists. At some point, at some time, someone will put all of those together. In fact, certainly, they already have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We'll jump around a little bit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But your work is so fascinating and it covers so many topics. So if we jump into the present with the Bohemian Grove and the Bilderberg group.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bilderbergers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the elites, as I think you've referred to them. So these gathering of the elites, can you just talk about them? What is this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but they formed an exclusive men's club, was and still is. And nothing terribly unusual about that at the time. But it became fashionable. And as it became fashionable, more wealthy people wanted to become part of it. And the thing about getting rich guys to join your club is what do rich guys have? Money. And of course, it's one of those rich guys that bought Bohemian Grove where now you build your old boys summer camp, which is what it is. They got cabins with goofy names. They go there, they perform skits, they dress up in costumes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>True. Some of those skits look like pagan human sacrifices, but it's just a skit. What's really going on there? So on the one hand you can argue, look, it's a rich guy's club. They like to get out there. The whole motto of the place is weaving spiders come not here. So we're going to talk about in business. We just want to get out into the woods, put on some robes, burn a couple of effigies in front of the owl, have a good time, probably get drunk a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's with the robes? Why do they do weird creepy shit? Why do they put on a mask and the robe and do the plays and the owl and then sacrificing, I don't know, whatever?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Why do you have a giant owl?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Why do you do that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is that in human nature because I don't think rich people are different than not rich people, what is it about wealth and power that brings that out of people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, part of it is the ritual aspect of it. And yeah, that clearly is a ritual. Rituals are pretty simple. Rituals are just a series of actions performed in a precise sequence to produce an effect. That describes a lot of things. It describes plays, symphonies, every movie you've ever seen. A movie is a ritual. It is a series of actions carried out in a precise sequence to produce an effect with an added soundtrack to cue you to what emotions you're supposed to be feeling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a great idea. So the rich people should just go to a movie or maybe just go to a Taylor Swift concert. Why do you have to, why the owl thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the beginning of his second presidential campaign. He was being vetted. So one of the main theories, call it a conspiracy theory or not, about the Bohemian Club and the gatherings, is that people of wealth and influence gather together and whether or not it's part of the agenda or not, inevitably you're going to talk about things of interest. But to me, the mere fact that you invite people in, political leaders, to give lakeside talks means that there are weaving spiders which are going on and it is a perfect private venue to vet people for political office.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, where else are you going to do it, if you are interested in vetting, if you are interesting and powerful people selecting?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well see, here's the question. Are these guys actually picking who's going to be president? Is that the decision which is being made or are they just deciding what horses they're going to back?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the latter is the simpler version of it, but it doesn't mean it's the other way around. But these are the kinds of, Nixon was, there was the whole 1960 thing. So he's the new Nixon, remember, and this is where the new Nixon apparently made a good impression on the right people because he did indeed get the Republican nomination and he did indeed become president.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there could also be a much more innocent explanation of really it's powerful people getting together and having conversations and through that conversation, influencing each other's view of the world and just having a legitimate discussion of policies, foreign policy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Why wouldn't they? Why would you assume that people are not going to do that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the owl thing with the robes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Why the owl and why the robes?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which is why it becomes really compelling when guys like Alex Jones, forgive me, but I have not watched his documentary, I probably should at some point, about the Bohemian Grove where he claims that there is a Satanist human sacrifice of, I think, children. And I think that's quite a popular conspiracy theory. Or has lost popularity, it kind of transformed itself into the QAnon set of conspiracy theories. But can you speak to that conspiracy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let's put it this way, the general public rich people are inherently suspicious.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of itself inherently evil or sinister, but it means that there are lots of different people in it who have different agendas. It goes back to what I said about how somebody feels about the cremation of care ritual. This is either just a waste of time, it's just some sort of silly thing that we're doing or it's something of great importance. Perhaps even mystical or religious importance. Because that's ostensibly what it's pretending to be. There's always this question as to what degree you begin to play and the play becomes serious. That tends to happen a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've studied a lot of cults and occultism, what do you think is the power of that mystical experience?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that it's a trick, yet we can't really figure out, if he does it well, how that trick is being accomplished because it seems to defy physical laws. And that's fascinating about it. So even though it's a trick, if you can't figure it out, it has this kind of power of fascination. But it's mimicking something. Stage magic is mimicking real magic. So what's real magic. Well, let's go back to Aleister Crowley because he always has to come. I knew he was going to come up at some point in this, earlier than not, because he always does.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All roads lead to Aleister.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be because if you're all a part of a mob, which is there in the gymnasium and you get into this and you get worked up and a cultist would argue what you're doing is you're creating a huge amount of energy. All of these people are putting energy into something and that energy goes somewhere. And maybe you can. Maybe, just maybe, you actually can slightly increase the chances of your team's victory. Of course, your opponents are having their own ritual at the same time. So whoever has the bigger mojo will apparently win on the team.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I would say trivial example of that, but a clear one. I do believe that there's incredible power in groups of humans getting together and morphing reality. I think that's probably one of the things that made human civilization what it is. Groups of people being able to believe a thing and bring that belief into reality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, you're exactly right. Bring to conceive of something and then through intention, will, to manifest that into this realm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, that power of the collective mind can be leveraged by charismatic leaders to do all kinds of stuff, where you get cults that do horrible things or anything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There might be a cult that does good things. I don't know. It depends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We usually don't call those cults.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't call those cults.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. A hundred percent.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Without endorsing this entirely and interesting, one of the questions, what's the difference between a cult and a religion? And it has been said that in the case of a cult, there's always someone at the top who knows what's going on, generally, who knows it's a scam. In a religion, that person is dead. So see, I've just managed to insult every single religion. But it's an... ... Insult every single... But, it's an interesting way of thinking about it, because I think there is some degree of accuracy in that statement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually, the interesting psychological question is, in cults, do you think the person at the top always knows that it's a scam? Do you think there's something about the human mind where you gradually begin to believe it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Begin to believe your own bullshit?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

There was none in the Ottoman Empire, which was a fairly tumultuous place, because in 1908 and 1909, there was the Young Turk Revolution. And, you had a military coup, which effectively overthrew the Ottoman Sultan and installed a military junta, which would go on during the first World War to make its greatest achievement in the Armenian Genocide. Eventually, it created a genocidal military regime which would lead the country into a disastrous first world war, which would destroy the Ottoman Empire, out of which modern Turkey emerges.

Well, the Russian Revolution, which had now brought the idea, which brought another solution to all of this, the idea of revolutionary Marxism.

It wasn't something imported by the Russians. It was a German invention. One of the things you can see in this is The Thule Society was particularly involved in a anti-Marxist or anti-Bolshevik agitation. Sebottendorff saw them as this whole movement. It was a counter to this. It was a counter-Marxist movement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we try to break that apart in a nuanced way? So, it was a nationalist movement. The occult was part of the picture, occult racial theories. So, there's a racial component, like the Aryan race, so it's not just the nation of Germany.

And the agreement basically is that the Army will support Ebert's government if Ebert supports the Army. And particularly that means the continuation of the Officer Corps and the general staff in one form or another. So a deal is made. And that of course, is what will eventually help defeat the Spartacist uprising.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Now, was the Army doing the similar things that we've talked about with the intelligence agencies, this same trying to control the direction of public power?<|eot_id|>"}

The excessive devotion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's not an ideology behind that, like something like Scientology or some kind of religious or some kind of... I don't know, utopian ideology. Nothing like this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. I think that Madison, again, was essentially a criminal. He had a sociopathic mindset, and he hit upon a pretty good deal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But how do people convince anybody of anything? With a cult, usually you have either an ideology or you have maybe personal relations, like you said, sex and drugs. But underneath that, can you really keep people with sex and drugs? You have to convince them that you love them in some deep sense. There's a commune of love.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have a lot of people there in the cult. They have some sort of, what we like to call dysfunctional families. A lot of the females in particular seem to have come from more or less middle-class families, but those are full of dysfunction. Their parents didn't love them. They were semi-runaways. And now they had this whole family. A lot of the younger women had children, some of them by Manson, some of them by the others. They bonded together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And again, we return to that pull towards belonging that gets us humans into trouble. So it does seem that there was a few crimes around this time. So, the Zodiac Killer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, California, where I'm from... I remember this period vividly. By the way, the Tate LaBianca killings occurred on my birthday, the year I graduated from high school. So I remember this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Happy birthday.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at. I didn't find much correspondence in any of those. In one of the killings, I think the one in Lake Berryessa, he does appear in this kind of weird hooded costume. He's got his symbol that sort of compass or aiming reticle circle with a cross through it. It can mean a variety of things. He used guns and he used knives, but he certainly had to think for couples. Except in the last of the killings, which is of a cab driver in downtown San Francisco, who he shoots in full view of witnesses, which is completely atypical.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also when he was stabbing the victims, it doesn't seem like he was very good at it. Or if the goal was to kill them, he wasn't very good at it because some of them survived.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, he's not particularly thorough about it. He seems to have had much more.... More of the violence seems to be directed at the females than the males.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I mean, there's a couple of questions to ask here. First of all, did people see his face?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at Berryessa, he was wearing a mask. So there's something in common initially in the targeting of victims, which doesn't in the last case. Then after that, there's just these different cases of where there's a pretty good case to be made. A woman who claims, I think she and a small child were picked up. Her car broke down, she got a flat tire, and she was picked up by this guy who she got a very sort of strange vibe from who eventually just let her go. Well, that might've been the Zodiac. It might not have been.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You do this kind of rigorous look saying like, okay, what is the actual facts that we know? Reduce it to the thing that we know for sure. And in speaking about his motivation, he said that he was collecting souls.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Souls for the afterlife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For the afterlife.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's kind of a cultie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean that's what I believe. Is it the Vikings or the Romans? They believed this in battle.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're essentially making sacrificial victims, and they will be your ghostly servants in the afterlife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think he actually believed that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's kind of an interesting clue. So does that mean he's a comic book collector? When would he have... I mean, that one and also where he got the idea from, and so he's incorporating these things from. Then there are of course his codes, which people have, which aren't all that difficult to decipher probably because they weren't meant to be. The other thing that you find often with serial or psychopathic killers is they're toying with the press. I mean, this goes all the way back to Jack the Ripper. They get attention, and then he just disappears.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think he was never caught?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think they knew who to look for. There was nothing much to go on. There was a guy who was long a suspect, and then eventually they tested his DNA and find it didn't match any of the things that they'd found. Again, it goes back to, I'm not even sure that it's one person who's responsible for all of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the interesting things you bring up here and our discussion of Manson inspires this, but there does seem to be a connection, a shared inspiration between several killers here, the Zodiac, the Son of Sam later, and the monster of Florence. So is it possible there's some kind of underworld that is connecting these people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>exist? Well, they do. Okay. There was one in my hometown, apparently quite harmless as far as I know, never did anything. But there are people who robes. Here we come again, robes, cut the head off a chicken, naked woman as an altar. You can get off on that I suppose, if that's your thing. So professed satanists exist, satanic cults exist, serial killers exist, ritual murders exist. Are those things necessarily connected? No. Could they be connected? Yes. There's nothing. Don't ever tell me that something is just too crazy for people to do because that's crazy talk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've studied secret societies. You gave a lot of amazing lectures on secret societies. It's fascinating to look at human history through the lens of secret societies because they've permeated all of human history. You've talked about from everything from the Knights Templar to Illuminati, Freemasons, like we brought up. Freemasons lasted a long time. Illuminati, you've talked about in its sort of main form, lasted a short time, but its legend.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Never gone away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Never gone away. So maybe Illuminati is a really interesting one. What was that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>anywhere, which leaves wondering what's its real name. So Illuminati is simply the plural of Illuminatus, which means one who is illuminated, one who has seen the light. So in Roman times, Christian converts were Illuminati because they had seen the light, anyone who thinks. And there have been organizations called Illuminati. The term is not trademarked, not copyrighted. Anybody who thinks they've seen the light about anything is an Illuminati. So it defines nothing. The symbol of the order was an owl, which interestingly enough is almost identical to the owl which is the emblem of the Bohemian Club.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, boy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was ruled by an Illuminati prince. And so nothing ever happens to these. No Illuminati is ever put to death or arrested in prison for any period of time. What happens is that their plan... Well, what was his plan? His plan was to essentially replace all existing religions and governments in the world with a one world order governed by the Illuminati. So to do this, you had to subvert and destroy all the existing order. And he argued the purpose for this is we wish to make men happy and free, but first we must make them good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hold of the order's, inner texts. So the story is they're delivered to them. I think that Weishaupt gave them to him. I think he engineered the exposure of his order because it gave him publicity. By being exposed in Bavaria, you gained great renown. And they continued to recruit after this, and the Bavarian government actually bans the Illuminati four different times. Why? Because apparently the first three times didn't work. So the fourth one does. You can notice that it's like Papal bans on Freemasonry. They just go on and on and on because this clearly isn't working.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you actually highlight, speaking of publicity, that there's a difference between visibility and transparency. That a secret society could be visible, it could be known about, it could be quite popular, but you could still have a secrecy within it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have no idea what's going on inside. It's like a black box. If I set a black box on this table, we can see that there is a black box. What's in the black box? A cat? Who knows?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In fact, the secrecy might be the very thing that makes it even more popular.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to make the order mysterious for that exact reason. Always hold out the possibility that knowledge, special knowledge that no mere mortals have other than you will have in that way. So he senses a lot of things, the use of vanity and ego to recruit people to influence both men and women, it's quite sophisticated and as you might expect from a professor of canon law trained by Jesuits. So I certainly don't think that it ceased when it was banned in Bavaria because everybody just scatters and goes elsewhere like Paris. And then you have the French Revolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the idea of the Illuminati to put it crudely, the branding is a really powerful one. And so it makes sense that there's a thread connecting it to this day that a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies can adopt the branding.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Anybody can call it. You can go out and form a club, and call it the Illuminati.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you are effective at it, I think it does attract. It's the chicken or the egg. But powerful people tend to have gigantic egos, and people with gigantic egos tend to like the exclusivity of secret societies. And so it's a gravitational force that pulls powerful people to these societies. It's exclusive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Only certain. And you also notice something goes back to when we were talking about much earlier when we were talking about intelligence. Remember MEIS? Ego.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ego, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Ease of recruitment and control. That's a great Achilles heel in human beings, the exploitation of ego.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, if we go back to the conversation of intelligence agencies, it would be very efficient and beneficial for intelligence agencies to infiltrate the secret societies because that's where the powerful people are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or the secret societies to infiltrate the intelligence agencies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh boy. Well, I mean that's actually in all the lectures, I kind of had a sense that intelligence agencies themselves are kind of secret societies, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>do ever. Or there will be dire consequences. So the method is very much the same. And also this idea of creating a kind of insular group. The organization is us, and everyone else is outside of that. We are guardians of special knowledge. See, this is the type of thing that would generally happen if you question whatever any kind of intelligence agency did. Well, we know things that you don't. Why? Because we're the organization that knows things. We collect information, we know the secrets, we guard the secrets. Therefore, if we tell you, you must believe us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I have this sense that there are very powerful secret societies operating today, and we don't really know or understand them. And the conspiracy theories in spirit might have something to them but are actually factually not correct. So an effective, powerful secret society or intelligence agency is not going to let you know anything that it doesn't want you to know, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mean, the Council on Foreign Relations is very similar to that and the Bilderbergers, and there's an overlap with the Bohemian Club. And then you've got the Pinay Cercle or Le Cercle, which is more military, but also linked to the so-called secret Gladio. The idea of the Soviets over around Western Europe, there would be a stay behind organization called Gladio. There'd be these freedom fighters. So the question I have about that is that how many secret organizations do you need? I mean, why all these separate groups which often seem to have the same people into them?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The closer I look, the more I wonder the same question we asked about the Russian intelligence agencies is where's the center of power? It seems to be very hard to figure out. Does the secrecy scare you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>cult leader is the answer to everything. And it seems to be very, very easy to get people to believe things. And then what happens is that whether or not those beliefs have any real basis in reality, they begin to influence your actions. So here again, regrettably in some ways to bring it back to the Nazis, what were the Nazis convinced of? They were convinced that Jews were basically evil aliens. That's what it comes down to. They weren't really humans. There's some sort of evil contamination which we must eradicate. And they set out to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they were sure that there's just a few problems that can be solved. And once you solve them that you have this beautiful utopia where everything would be just perfect, it'd be great, and we can just get there. And I think it's really strong belief in a global utopia. It just never goes right. It seems like impossible to know the truth in it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now in the future, everything will be good because the earth will be shared by the toilers. And from each abilities and to each according to his need. And it's this kind of sweet little song in some way. But I'm just sort of imagining this. If I was going to stage that, I'd have this choir of children singing it with a huge hammer and sickle behind them because that's what it's combining. And you can think that the sentiments that express in that song, which are legitimate in some way of all the horrors that then leads to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is fascinating about humans. A beautiful idea on paper, an innocent little idea about a utopian future can lead to so much suffering and so much destruction and the unintended consequences you see described.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The law of unintended consequences.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we learn from it. I mean, that's why history is important. We learn from it hopefully.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do we?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Slowly or slow learn.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm unconvinced of that, but perhaps.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of unconvinced, what gives you hope? If human beings are still here, maybe expanding out into the cosmos 1000, 5,000, 10,000 years from now, what gives you hope about that future, about even being a possible future about it happening?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Most people are cooperative and kind most of the time. And that's one of those things that can usually be depended upon. And usually you'll get back to what you put into it. Another thing that I have a weird fascination of watching are people who have meltdowns on airplanes because it's just bizarre.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating to watch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sort of psychotic break that occurs, and it's always going to end the same way. The cops are going to come on and drag you off the plane. Now. True, and you're going to inconvenience everybody there. And usually at some point, they don't care about that. That's the one little sense of power that they have. So they have some sort of sense of powerlessness. And if their only way of power is just to piss off everybody else on that plane, they're going to go ahead and do it even though it's going to lead nowhere for them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's similar sometimes psychological behavior in traffic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the road rage thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The road rage, yeah. It's fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I bet that most, there again, those are all people who up to some point were cooperative and kind and polite, and then they snap. So those are all part of the human makeup as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also part of the human makeup, difference between humans and chimps is the ability to get together, cooperate on a mass scale over an idea, create things like the Roman Empire did. Laws that prevent us and protect us from crazy human behavior, manifestations of a man, some type of human.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, human beings are just weird animals all year round. It's just completely peculiar. I'm not sure that we're all together natural.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I think we are all together beautiful. There is something magical about humans, and I hope humans stay here even as we get advanced robots walking around everywhere.
