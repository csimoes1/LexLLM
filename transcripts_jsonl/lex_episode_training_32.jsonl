Space exists separately in each world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Sean Carroll. His third time in this podcast. He is a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins, host of the Mindscape Podcast that I personally love and highly recommend, and author of many books, including the most recent book series called The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. The first book of which is titled Space, Time, and Motion. It's on the topic of general relativity. The second coming out on May 14th, you should definitely pre-order it, it's titled the Quanta and Fields. That one is on the topic of quantum mechanics. Sean is a legit, active, theoretical physicist and at the same time is one of the greatest communicators of physics ever. I highly encourage you listen to his podcast, read his books, and pre-order the new book to support his work. This was, as always, a big honor and a pleasure for me. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends here's Sean Carroll. In book one of the series, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe called Space, Time, Motion, you take on classical mechanics, general relativity by taking on the main equation of general relativity and making it accessibly easy to understand. Maybe at the high level, what is general relativity? What's a good way to start to try to explain it?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the tension between physics and mathematics.

It's two different theories. One theory in N dimensions of space-time without gravity, and another theory in N+1 dimensions of space-time with gravity. The idea is that this N dimensional theory is casting a hologram into the N+1 dimensional universe to make it look like it has gravity. That's holography with a vengeance, and that's an enormous source of interest for theoretical physicists these days.

To push back on what they're optimized for is different to describe how they're trained versus what they're optimized for. So they're trained in this very trivial way of predicting text tokens, but you can describe what they're optimized for and what the actual task in hand is, is to construct a world model, meaning an understanding of the world.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yup.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said that general relativity is the most beautiful theory ever.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So far.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you find beautiful about it?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, humans.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it brings attention to good science. I think it's probably a net negative for science because it makes people want to win the Nobel Prize.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a lot of fascinating human stories underneath it all. Science is its own thing but it's also a collection of humans and it's a beautiful collection. There's tension, there's competition, there's jealousy but there's also great collaborations and all that kind of stuff. Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed, is one of the great stories of collaboration in science.<|eot_id|>"}

And Sean, thank you for being the person that makes us celebrate science and fall in love with all of these beautiful ideas in science, for writing amazing books, for being legit and still pushing forward the research science side of it and for allowing me and these pothead questions and also for educating everybody through your own podcast. Everybody should stop everything and subscribe and listen to every single episode of Mindscape. So, thank you, I've been a huge fan forever, I'm really honored that you would speak with me in the early days when I was still starting this podcast in Meanings of the World.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I appreciate it. Thanks very much for having me on.

To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman. Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
