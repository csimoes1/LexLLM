As a trial lawyer, James, for over two decades, has negotiated and litigated a huge number of high conflict divorces. This has given him a deep understanding of how relationships fail and how they can succeed, and bigger than that, the role of love and pain in this whole messy rollercoaster ride we call life.

There's a Edgar Alan Poe quote, \"The years of love have been forgotten in the hatred of a minute.\" I always am saddened, deeply saddened how people seem to forget how many beautiful moments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways.<|eot_id|>"}

I think it is a deliberate choice because I think memory can basically... That's how trauma works. It can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff completely drowns out all the positives. So I think it's a deliberate choice to make your memory probably work that way. In relationships, betrayal can do that, right? Cheating, infidelity, one event can almost erase the entirety of your understanding of the past. And all the memories are shrouded in this darkness of, \"Okay.
