{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and I think more important question because like Tom Wolfe said about bankruptcy, \"It happens very slowly and then all at once.\" Disconnection happens very slowly and then all at once. So most of the time what I think people want is an answer like cheating, but cheating is the big all at once thing. How did we get to the place where cheating was even something you were thinking about doing or that you would think about and then cross the line from thought into action? And that's, I think, the big question. So disconnection would be my answer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's possible to introspect looking backwards for every individual case where the disconnection began and how it evolved?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>see it clearly. I think as a divorce lawyer whose job is to really drill down on the facts and figure out what's going on in this story, I have to look at both sides. So I have to think a lot about my own arguments, but I also have to think about what's the other lawyer's argument going to be, especially in custody cases. So I really have been forced to look at both sides for so many years, so deeply in relationships. Once you do that, you realize that the good guy, bad guy thing just doesn't apply.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder if it's the little things or a few big things that cause this connection. You've talked about granola and blowjobs, but those seem to be stories that you can tell to yourself like... Maybe that story should be explained or maybe not.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You don't think granola and blowjobs is self-explanatory?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Almost. I think people can construct a good... If you ask GPT, what do they mean? I think the story that would come up is a pretty good one. But that's a story you tell about when you first knew the disconnection has begun is when he stopped buying my favorite granola or when she stopped giving blowjobs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say when it's reached a critical mass.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, phase shift of some sort.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because I think it started before that. When she said, \"Yeah, I used to give him blowjobs when we were in our early relationship, and then one day, I just was like, oh well, we don't have as much time. I'll wait until later, and we'll have sex and then we both enjoy it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Blowjobs are inefficient.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>would never show us. If you said, \"Why does this person love you?\" They wouldn't say, \"Oh, I always make sure that when the paper comes, I bring it from the bottom of the driveway to the door so they don't have to go out and get it.\" Or \"I always hold the door for them.\" Again, \"I buy the granola that I know this person likes.\" Or \"I remembered that they don't like it when I put on this particular record so I don't put it on.\" Yes, they're small things, but they're not small. They're kind of everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's good to communicate that stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, 100%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It takes away some of the power of it, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>used to do this, and you've stopped,\" that feels like something to me. She said she didn't say anything about that, just like he probably didn't say anything about the blowjobs. I think if there had been a moment of, this is starting. Let's talk about it while it's starting. But people wait. From what I can see, people wait until the big thing happens. The financial impropriety, the substance use disorder, the cheating. They wait for that to happen and then they go, \"Where did we go wrong?\" And the answer is, quite a while ago with the granola.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. So when you notice something, you notice that little something, talk about it because that little something is probably a kernel of a deeper truth. Of course, there is also moods. We're all a rollercoaster of emotion. So you can not bring a granola one day just because you're in this place where just nothing is... Just cynicism everywhere, just anger and so on. But it's a temporary feeling, but maybe that temporary feeling is grounded in some other deeper current that's actually building up.<|eot_id|>"}

So I think it would be great if it didn't have to be a conscious practice, but I wonder if like anything in meditation or mindfulness, it's a matter of exercising that way of seeing.

That's so amazing about marriage is there's almost 8 billion people in the world, and you're picking this one. So when you marry, in theory, the stock is at its highest. You're as crazy about each other as you could possibly be. So that's the time to get into this mindfulness, to get into this practice, not once the wheels are starting to come off. It's much harder. It's gaining a bunch of weight and then saying, \"How am I going to lose the weight now?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think that even before marriage, right away, just see everything is beautiful.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a certain sense where if you, from the very beginning...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>worry about what everybody else is doing in their relationship. It's not to me surprising that as the performative aspects of life on social media increases, people's satisfaction with their relationships and the divorce rate is following the same trend because I think everyone is going, \"Well, what's everybody else doing? Well, how much sex is everyone else having?\" The only two people that should worry about how much sex you're having are the two people. If the two people are happy in the relationship, great.

Because you're going to either go without or go elsewhere, and neither of those is a particularly healthy option or helpful option. It's the start of that decline. So why open yourself to that decline, which invariably is just the path to the chair in front of me in my office?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a full section in your book on foot fetishes?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>song. I just don't know. Sex has been so politicized in recent years. Maybe it always was.

I'm not into feet, but if the woman I love was like, \"I'm really into feet, I really want to do stuff with your feet,\" I'd be like, all right, I can pretend that I'm into that. It's not going to kill me. I'm not going to be able to make it a centerpiece of our coupling, but yeah, I can pretend I'm into feet if you want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't personally have any fetishes that are outside of the normal discourse.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As a divorce lawyer, I get to experience the whole spectrum.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But if I was into furries, for example, I don't know how I would initiate the conversation with my partner about that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But frame the question the other direction.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so if you know you're super into furries and you don't tell your partner about that, and your partner says, \"I love you so much, and you know what I love, one of the things I love about us is we have such great sexual chemistry,\" You'll never feel that love because you know that's not true though, she doesn't know.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>who practice jiu-jitsu know, you start to sort of see jiu-jitsu in everything. I genuinely believe that in love, you have to give something to get something. Everything you do creates a vulnerability. Every move you make in jiu-jitsu creates opportunity and creates vulnerability. And so you have to be willing to create vulnerabilities in order to get any leverage, in order to get any progress and any way to move the position. You don't want a marriage that's just two people both in 50-50. You're just sitting in that guard doing nothing. You want it to actually move along.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the way I see love and relationships.

It really is shocking how much leverage we give to our romantic partners and how little genuine discussion we really have about it, how much we really are ever trained to think about it. There's nothing in school that teaches us about it. So much of literature and art is an idealized version of it. So little of it is real.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And no matter how it evolves, when it ends in tragedy or drama, I feel like what people don't do enough is appreciate the good times, appreciate how beautiful it is to having taken the risk and to having experienced that kind of love. I think when you look at people that are divorcing each other... There's a Edgar Alan Poe quote, \"The years of love have been forgotten in the hatred of a minute.\" I always am saddened, deeply saddened how people seem to forget how many beautiful moments have been shared when some reason, some drama, some breakup leads them to part ways.<|eot_id|>"}

But behind closed doors, I'm very candid with people.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was wrong. It was awful. And I don't understand why that would have to be how we do it. I think we could look at relationships like what they are, which is chapters in a book. And that book is our life, and those chapters all have significance. The later chapters, none of them would happen without the prior ones. So there's this beauty to me, of that. And I don't know if it's a choice or if that is how it is, and the rest is just narrative that we've put on top of it culturally for some reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think to push back a little bit, I think memory can also... I think it is a deliberate choice because I think memory can basically... That's how trauma works. It can surface the negative stuff and the negative stuff completely drowns out all the positives. So I think it's a deliberate choice to make your memory probably work that way. In relationships, betrayal can do that, right? Cheating, infidelity, one event can almost erase the entirety of your understanding of the past. And all the memories are shrouded in this darkness of, \"Okay. What I believed was true is totally untrue.\" And so to overcome that and still appreciate the beautiful moments.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm continually astounded by how long the hurt and anger of betrayal can reverberate. I have clients who were four years, five years past when the divorce ended, the cheating was discovered, and they're as angry as they were the day they found out. And I don't know what that's about because I also have clients that they look back on it and they go, \"We screwed up. We didn't do the best, but we did the best we could do at the time.

It just seems like it's complicated, and people's intentions and where they actually end up are different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

They thought that they had their Perry Mason moment.

It turns out I was really tired.\" Does that not happen by text?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No. Because sometimes, it's hard to probably apologize for being an asshole.

Every photo you post. I mean, that's going on with... what's his name... Jake Paul or whatever Paul and Dillon Danis right now.

I have to show these awful things to the world about myself, but it's not as bad as what she's claimed I've done.\" So I get it. I'm not saying That's incorrect. And for Amber Heard, I think her response is, \"Well, for him to say I'm lying, I have to prove my...\" But my god, what an awful thing to watch. All it really is, it's just another couple... You know how banal that is? You know how many of those-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this kind of stuff happens a lot?<|eot_id|>"}

So that's proof that I'm a good dad.\" I'm like, \"There's photos of Jeffrey Dahmer smiling with people he ate later. And you think these photos prove something?\" The lack of... I'm in the middle of a very complex domestic violence trial. And the entire defense on the other side is, \"Well, we have photos of them on vacation where they look very happy and she never called the cops.\" That's no defense at all. Most victims of intimate partner abuse don't call the cops. They don't self-identify as victims of domestic violence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they probably have many stretches of time of intense happiness, or happiness?<|eot_id|>"}

This should teach us something about how not only are there two sides to every story, that there's just so much complexity and nuance to these. But I think everyone was asking the question whether you were team Depp, team Heard, or team I could care less about either of these people. Everybody's looking at it going, \"Why? Eight billion people in the world. Why did you stay together? Just break up. You're miserable. It's obvious. It's obvious you're not...

Don't talk to anyone else. That's a little... what does he say... a two-arm circle or something, whatever the expression is. But basically resolve it all internally.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you don't take sides against the family. You don't show that weakness to the world. I mean, again, I don't know that Steve, in candor, would say, \"You shouldn't discuss it with your own therapist.\" But I think what he's saying is, don't project it out to the world, don't share that because I think it can change the way people view your relationship, which then will change the way you view your relationship. And so I think don't run reckless when it comes to that primary relationship, don't run your mouth recklessly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's, one of the things I mentioned to you offline, that my now close friend, Joe Rogan, I've never heard him ever speak negatively of his wife. It's always super positive how awesome of a person she is. And that, to me, has always been an inspiration to do the same for everybody in my life, to always speak positively about them.

Yeah, I'm not good at memorizing that, it takes time.\" But I've never heard him say, \"Oh, marriage is a lot of work.\" I think that's to his credit because it seems like they're enjoying that.

And so I actually think it's my number one, other than extemporaneous speaking ability, it is my number one job tool, is the ability to radically empathize and to put myself in the emotional state of someone in its best possible light and its worst possible light so that I can see again, the defense and I can see the vulnerability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I mean, so that's beautifully put, but also just to bear witness to this connection broken in those dramatic way, over and over and over and over.<|eot_id|>"}

And so for me, it's actually a job that is very consistent with my desire to build connection and to be empathetic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And witnessing the ashes doesn't make you cynical about the whole thing of love?<|eot_id|>"}

But you know what, I don't care. I don't care and I believe we don't care. Again, I think there's something to that.

And the old man says that that is the best part, missing the love is still love. The real bad part is when you forget it, when the pain fades and it's all gone.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Prenup is an excellent idea. A prenup is a contract between two people that binds their respective rights and obligations in the event of a divorce when it comes to financial issues. That's all it is and there's a lot of reasons to have them and there really aren't any reasons not to have them other than the fact it requires an uncomfortable conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I mean, there's a few questions here. First, do they work legally in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there are weird technicalities, but yeah, prenups are binding. As long as there's been some minimal asset disclosure, which is easily done in a prenup, and as long as there's not a language deficiency, meaning that the person who is reading it understands English to the level that they understand what they're signing, and if they don't that at least they've acknowledged in their native language that there is some opportunity for this to be translated for them, yeah, they're binding. They're presumptively binding. We live thankfully in a culture where people are allowed to enter into contracts about money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some prenups that you've seen that can be effective or that people converge towards in terms of what does an agreement look like? Because the popular conception is when there's no prenup, both sides get half.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are making changes to your rights and obligations under law. That's what you're doing. Marriage from a legal standpoint, what we mean when we say I got married is a state agency. It's been created by the state. This is a legal status that most people who are in it know nothing about. They just did the most legally significant thing they're ever going to do other than dying. And they have no idea what rights and obligations it created in them. And the first time they're going to get an education about it is in my office, that's crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When they get divorced.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so, prenup is an opportunity to learn something about it at the start.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So first of all, whenever someone approaches me about prenups and that's like four or five times a week probably depending on the season, right before wedding season, we get a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When's wedding season?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it used to just be the summer. They say when you marry in June, you're a bride all your life. That's from some Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Now, the fall is very big too. People love fall content, fall weddings, pretty pictures and things.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Listen, weddings is for the gram. I have to tell you, weddings is performative, man. See, the problem is though, it's curated. So here's us picking the cake, it's not here's us doing the prenup. You know how many people I've done prenups for that I've watched on their social media or them being interviewed by Andy Cohen on Bravo and saying, \"Well no, we don't have a prenup.\" Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. You do. It's in my office. It's in a folder. They have a prenup.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But prenups are not published any place. They're not filed with a court. They're maintained by the two people that signed it and their lawyers. That's it. So nobody has to admit that they have a prenup.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, but there's a certain problem with that insofar as a lot of people have prenups and we need to normalize prenups. There's no reason not to normalize prenups. Until some famous people say, \"Yeah, we have a prenup. We're crazy about each other. That's why we're getting married. But yeah, look, we're getting...\" I don't want to get a car accident but I got a seatbelt. You have it, just in case.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I mean, what do you do if you're running a company? What does that have to do with a prenup?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, his was before it was anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But how does that work in a prenup?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the prenuptial agreement that said for every 10 pounds she gained during the marriage, she would lose $10,000 a month in alimony if they divorced. Here's her baseline weight as of the time of execution of this agreement. I wondered if she did what a wrestler does. Did she bulk up right before and then cut when she eventually got divorced? Is she in there in a sauna with the suit on? And the appellate court essentially said, \"I don't know why you married this person having had them make you sign this, but it's binding, but it's binding.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wish somebody would do a contract like the rent for this place would be more expensive if I was fatter, and cheaper if I was skinnier, and that way I would have to weigh in and like the motivation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Like some motivation on you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. That kind of prenup is motivating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, what's his name? I think Tim Ferris says that about how he does, he said you should make bets with people. It's like if you gain this much, I got to give you this amount of money. I think he says that in one of his early books.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And try to make a binding somehow, which is tough.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think when we create incentives of that kind, that's why there was the No Nut November or No Shave November, sober, all those, it was a competition. When people make a competition of something, they gamify something, it makes it something that people are more likely to stick with. So I mean, I guess a prenup, it'd be interesting. The problem is there's also, people put in prenups what's called fidelity clauses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I discourage people from putting in prenups, but very often people still put in prenups even with my caveat is fidelity clauses and sunset clauses. So fidelity clauses is I'm waiving alimony, I'm waiving this, I'm waiving that. But if you cheat, I get a million bucks or I get this much alimony, I get this amount. And I know the intention is to disincentivize the person from cheating, it's a deterrent to have them cheat, but all it really does is just creates an interesting legal battle for lawyers like how did you prove that they cheated or not?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, right. Because what constitutes cheating also?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, is an emotional affair, and affair is oral sex. Cheating is... And by the way, how do you prove it? Well, I was in a hotel with her, but how do you prove that I had sex with her? And you're opening a can of worms with that kind of a thing, but people sometimes still put them in. And sunset clauses. Sunset clauses is if we're married X period of time, this goes away as if it never existed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And why is that a bad idea?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm willing to take all of my premarital assets and throw them in the pot right now? Because if not, I got six months to get divorced.\" So if you say to someone, if you got married tomorrow and then you found a company that's worth $100 million dollars, and under your prenup, that's your separate property, but there's a sunset clause that says that your prenup goes out the window in 15 years. Man, at year 14 and six months, you got to ask yourself some serious questions about where's this relationship going to be in five, 10 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's brilliant. That's why, kids, you pay for a lawyer. That's it.<|eot_id|>"}

And the heart wants with the heart wants and I'm sorry.\" That one's tough. That one's tough, because it's an interesting distinction between men and women to some degree that when a man finds out his wife was cheating, the question is, \"Did you fuck him?\" And when a woman finds out that a man cheated, the question is, \"Do you love her?\" And those are different things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel like there could be many and have been many books written on that very distinction.<|eot_id|>"}

You were subject to professional scorn and all kinds of things if you were gay or lesbian. So people were sneaking around and having affairs with their same sex partners, and then they get caught. And then it really was a function of the fact that they were closeted. And again, that's another kind of complicated dynamic, because I haven't had that happen to me where a woman left me for a woman.

And people like Esther Perel, those are people who are making very intelligent discussions about that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's a complicated one.

So there may be lots of people having open relationships that don't end up in a divorce lawyer's office, so I'd never meet them.

And then that connection of those two people, like you think it's a soulmate all of a sudden now and it goes in this other, because again, is that novelty, it's the reason why I don't understand why people have threesomes. It's kind of like when someone sings to you, I don't know where to look. I don't know where to look. If someone's singing to me, I don't know where to look. It feels weird, right?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>long-term partner who you're in a relationship with, and a new person, seems to me a very dangerous ground because you're going to want to enjoy the novelty of this new person, but you're going to have to spend time with this person after. So how much attention do you spend to the new novel exciting thing without creating the impression that you're not interested in this? Because you're my favorite person, but this is fun. So I want to just try this for a few. But then also I don't want to forget about that. It just seems tricky.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That analogy, by the way is brilliant. And also I guess it's tricky because the consequences of mistakes are quite high.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and there's an easy way to misinterpret the data.
