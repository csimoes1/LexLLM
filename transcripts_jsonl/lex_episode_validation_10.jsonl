You gave what I think is a truly brave speech on the Iraq War in 2002, I believe.

So if a lot of them speak out, that's why if it came from the top, if a president was using a very large platform to basically speak out, it provides a safety blanket for the other politicians to get it out of the system.

There's countless horrific stories, but just basic stories of cost. Like my friend Dr. Peter Attia has this story where he happens to be wealthy so he can afford it, but he had to take his son to the emergency room and the son was dehydrated and the bill was $6,000. They just did a basic test and gave him an IV, a basic thing. And he has really good insurance and the insurance covered $ 4,000 of it. So he had at the end paid $2,000 for a basic emergency room visit. And there's a lot of families for whom that one visit for such a simple thing would be just financially devastating.<|eot_id|>"}

But I think the American people want fundamental changes there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's another good example of a really popular idea that is not implemented because of the money in politics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>underinsured, and our life expectancy is lower than virtually every other major country. Do you think that might be an issue that we'd be discussing?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, if a single politician discusses it to get punished for it. So there needs to be a mass movement and probably, I mean from my perspective, it has to come from the very top. It has to come from the president. And the president has to be a populist president where they don't care about the parties with the rich people. They just speak out because they know it's a popular message and they know it's the right thing. So speaking of that, you had a historic campaign run for president in 2016, and in the eyes of many people, mine included, you were screwed over by the DNC, especially the WikiLeaks emails showed. What's your just looking back feelings about that? And you're angry, are upset?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>midst of COVID, a lot of the ideas that we fought forward were implemented in that bill.

Is the worker today in real inflation accounted for dollars making more money than that work 50 years ago?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of close arguments there, but your point is well taken. It's either the same or a little bit higher or a little bit lower, depending on the statistics. It has not increased significantly, and the wealth inequality has increased significantly.<|eot_id|>"}

So there's a lot of fans of yours that wanted you to keep fighting. Because you forgave in the end the establishment and joined them in support. And your fans wanted to keep fighting for a takeover, for a progressive takeover, the Democratic Party. If you just look back and had to do it all over again, what would you do different?<|eot_id|>"}

And in 2020 I did the same with Biden and we had more success with Biden than we had with Clinton.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's this interesting story about a long time coming meeting between you and Obama in 2018, I believe. So Ari Rabin-Havt, who was a former deputy campaign manager, wrote a great book I would say about you called The Fighting Soul: On the Road with Bernie Sanders. And he tells many great stories, but one of them is your meeting with Obama. And he says that Obama told you, Bernie... I wish I could do a good Obama impression. Bernie, you're an Old Testament prophet. A moral voice for our party giving us guidance. Here's the thing though, prophets don't get to be king. Kings have to make choices, prophets don't. Are you willing to make those choices? Basically Obama's making the case that you have to sort of moderate your approach in order to win. So was Obama right?<|eot_id|>"}

And that takes courage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it does.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then it also shows that once you get into office, it's not so easy to oppose or to work against the military industrial complex.<|eot_id|>"}

That is a thorough, rigorous criticism of I would say hypercapitalism, a certain kind of capitalism that you argue that we are existing in today in the United States. But a lot of people would attribute to capitalism all the amazing technological innovations over the past 70 plus years that have contributed to increase in quality of life in GDP, decrease in poverty, decrease in infant mortality, increase in expected life expectancy. So how do you see the tension, the pros of capitalism and the cons of capitalism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>his friends, you got probably not more than five, 10,000 extraordinarily wealthy families who have unbelievable economic power over 7 billion people on this planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Elon Musk is actually an interesting case because he's investing all the money back into the businesses. So I think there is a balance to be struck and you just spoke to it, which is we can still celebrate even big companies that are bringing wealth to the world, that are building cool stuff, that are improving quality of life. But we can question of why is it that the working class does not have a living wage? In many cases, and sort of trying to find that balance.<|eot_id|>"}

To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Aristotle. \" The real difference between democracy and oligarchy is poverty and wealth. Wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy. And where the poor rule, that is democracy.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
