{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I do. Everybody talks about themselves. It's not about me. Nice guy, not a nice guy. What politics should be about? Is the issues facing the people of our country, the people of the world, and how we're going to address it. That's what it should be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, there's a interesting aspects to your life story. For example, in 1963, you were very active in the Civil Rights Movement, got arrested even for protesting segregation in Chicago, and you attended the famous March on Washington where MLK gave his I Have a Dream speech. What was that like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was extraordinary. Took a bus ride down with fellow students in the University of Chicago, and there was a zillion people there. I'm not sure if it was the first time I'd ever been in Washington in my life, but it was a very impressive moment. And what he was talking about, people very often forget about that, it was not only racial justice, it was jobs. Jobs and justice, that was the name of that rally. And so it's something I've never forgotten.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What influence did he have on you? What'd you learn about the way he enacted change in the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the message sent out, \"You're black. Deal with civil rights. Don't worry about foreign policy. We'll take care of that.\" But he said, \"If I talk about peace and nonviolence, I can't sit back and allow what's going on in Vietnam to continue without speaking out.\" Incredible courage to do that. And by the way, when he was assassinated at a fighting for the rights of AFSCME workers, garbage, guys that delivered the garbage who were treated terribly, low wages, bad working conditions. And he went out to support their right to form a union. That's when he got killed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So on the war front, one of the things that people don't often talk about, your work in politics. You gave what I think is a truly brave speech on the Iraq War in 2002, I believe. You voted no on the Iraq Resolution, you voted no on the Patriot Act, and you basically predicted very accurately what would happen if we go into Iraq. What was your thinking at the time behind those speeches, behind voting no on the Patriot Act on the Iraq Resolution?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of maybe the war in Vietnam and the ease and lies that people told. We went into Vietnam under a lie. We lost close to 60,000 Americans. Millions of people in the Vietnam and Cambodia died as a result of that. So I think twice about it. And then the war in Iraq, you had people like Dick Cheney and others telling us, \"Oh, they have nuclear weapons and all that stuff. It's the only way we can resolve the issue.\" I didn't believe it. I didn't agree with it. And you're right, it turns out, historically, I was right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the way to fight this thing that Martin Luther King tried to fight, which is the military industrial complex?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>massively large corporations control what's produced and the prices we pay. And then you look at our political system, and we don't talk about it. What is the reality of the political system today? And that is that billionaires are spending huge amounts of money to buy this election. In Trump's campaign, you got three multi-billionaires spending over $200 million, three people. Democrats have their billionaires. It's not quite as concentrated. But at the end of the day, billionaires play an enormous role in terms of electing politicians and in Washington in determining what legislation gets seen and not seen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's not just single billionaires. It's companies with lobbyists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You got it. Let me give you one example, lobbyists. We pay, in the United States, by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. This is an issue I've been working hard on with some success. Take a wild and crazy guess how many lobbyists are there from the drug companies in Washington D.C.?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Over a thousand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is why, one of the reasons why we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Military-industrial complex, you've got a revolving door. People go from the military into the General Dynamics, into Lockheed Martin, and the other large companies, and what we see there is an institution in the Pentagon. We spend a trillion dollars a year on the Pentagon. It is the only federal agency that is not able to submit to an independent audit. So if you think there's not massive fraud and waste and cost overruns in the Pentagon, you would be sorely mistaken.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think most politicians are corrupt in accepting the money, or is the system corrupt? Or is it a bit of both?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They are, in a sense, your political base, so you're very cognizant of what you do in terms of not upsetting them. So it's not corruption in the sense of people taking envelopes with huge amounts of money to vote a certain way. That very, very rarely, if ever, happens. It is the power of big money to make politicians dependent on those folks. And that's why when I ran for president, what I probably may be most proud of is the fact that we received millions and millions of campaign contributions averaging 27 bucks apiece, I think, in 2016.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have companies, lobbyists ever tried to buy you, tried to influence you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't welcome them into our office. I do deal with these guys, but it's usually on a confrontational tone. No, so they don't come into my office very often telling me their problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do we fix the system? How do we get money out of politics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>view, we move to public funding of elections. That means you want to run for governing, you want to run for Senate, show that you have some support, get $5 contributions from X number of people to show you you're not a flake. You have some support and the government will pay a certain amount more, and there'll be a limit in the amount of money that can be spent. So it'll be a real... You can run against me and I'm not going to outspend you 10 to one. That's what we should be moving toward in my view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do we make that happen when there's so much money in the system and the politicians owe to the people who paid for their election? Does it have to come from the very top, essentially sort of a really strong, popular populist president?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you're right. You raised exactly the question. If I'm getting a huge amount of money from billionaires, do you think I'm going to go out and announce, \"I think billionaires should not be involved in buying elections\"? I doubt that very much. So what you're going to need, and you tell me if I'm missing something, but I pay attention, you don't hear either of the major candidates talking about that issue, do you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think what happens is when an individual politician speaks out about it, they get punished, but I think this is a popular idea. So if a lot of them speak out, that's why if it came from the top, if a president was using a very large platform to basically speak out, it provides a safety blanket for the other politicians to get it out of the system. But there has to be kind of a mass movement of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Republican, you're a Democrat, you're progressive, you're conservative, who really believes that we are a democracy when billionaires can spend tens and tens of millions of dollars to buy elections? So it is a very popular issue. It's important. You're right. We need political leaders to be speaking out on that, but we need a grassroots movement to say, when somebody is at a town meeting, you're running for the Senate, you're running for the House, what's your view on Citizens United? Are you prepared to vote to overturn that decision and move to public funding of elections? Extraordinarily important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So many of your policy proposals are quite radical.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, they're not. I beg to differ.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 00:13:26]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, they're popular. So what I mean is relative to what the way other politicians speak, it's usually a little bit more moderate. So from everything you've learned from politics, is it better to go sort of radical, maybe we can come up with a different word, versus a more moderate, safe, ambiguous kind of policies?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, let's talk about it. Fair enough. We talked about one issue, very important, money in politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Money, yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Getting big money out of politics, do you think that's a radical idea?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah. It's a popular idea. It's an idea that makes sense. But in order to implement it and actually make it happen, it requires to flip the system upside down, right? In that sense, it's radical.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>country in Europe. So the idea that healthcare should be available to all or that there should be no out-of-pocket expense because it's a human right is widespread around the world and very much agreed to in this country. Bottom line is that because of our corrupt political system, we have a healthcare system designed not to provide healthcare to all people, to make huge profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies. And that is what's happening, and we got to change that system. So I'm a strong advocate, and I've led the effort on Medicare for all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, let's talk about Medicare for all. If you could snap your fingers today and implement the best possible healthcare system for the United States of America, what would that look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we have a pretty good system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What would that look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>everybody in the system. So I think in a four or five year period you can strengthen Medicare and have everybody in the system. And when you do that, and this is not just me talking, number of studies have pointed this out. When you take the profit motive out of it from the insurance companies and the drug companies, you can end up providing quality care to all people at no more than we're spending right now. Because right now we are spending twice as much per personal healthcare as the people of any other nation. Incredibly wasteful system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the way to pay for the system is to increase taxes. But you're saying if you cut that cost and increase the taxes you're saying it's going to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Here's the story, and I've gotten my share of 30 second ads attacking me on this. Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes on healthcare. It's true, in a progressive way. But right now, do you have health insurance?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you are a family, let's just say you're self-employed right now and you have a couple of kids and a wife, it could cost you 15, $20,000 a year in insurance costs. Well, that's all eliminated. Will you have to pay more in taxes? Of course you will. Maybe it depends on your income level, but it could be that you'd be paying $12,000 more in taxes, but not $20,000 more in premiums, co-payments and deductibles, you save money. So it's paying taxes rather than paying money to the insurance company. You got a better deal through the tax system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the most painful thing in today's system is the surprise bills, the number one cause of bankruptcy and the psychological pain that comes from that, just worrying stress in debt.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You got it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And just basically afraid constantly of getting sick because you don't know if insurance is going to cover it. And if you're not insured, you don't know how much it's going to cost. So you're not going to go to the hospital even if there's something wrong with you, if there's pain and all that. So you just live in a state of fear, psychological fear. That's the number one problem. It's just not just financial, psychological-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you with cancer, you're scared to death. You're worried about how you're going to live, you're going to die, what's going to happen? And then on top of that, you got to worry about whether your family goes bankrupt. How insane and cruel is that? So to me, I think healthcare is what unites us all. Everybody has family. They get sick, we all get born, we all die, we all want care. And we all have got to come together to create a system that works for all of us, not just the drug companies or the insurance companies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just so many stories and not even the horrific stories. There's countless horrific stories, but just basic stories of cost. Like my friend Dr. Peter Attia has this story where he happens to be wealthy so he can afford it, but he had to take his son to the emergency room and the son was dehydrated and the bill was $6,000. They just did a basic test and gave him an IV, a basic thing. And he has really good insurance and the insurance covered $ 4,000 of it. So he had at the end paid $2,000 for a basic emergency room visit. And there's a lot of families for whom that one visit for such a simple thing would be just financially devastating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And you know what? People know that, and you know what they say? I don't feel well today. Something's wrong. I ain't going to go to that emergency room because I don't want a $6,000 bill. And what happens? He had insurance that paid two thirds of it, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what happens if he didn't? What happens if he didn't have money? He'd be handed by bill collectors for the rest of his life. So it is a disgusting system. It is an inhumane system, but the insurance companies and the drug companies are very powerful and they make a lot of campaign contributions, have a lot of lobbyists than we are where we are. But I think the American people want fundamental changes there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's another good example of a really popular idea that is not implemented because of the money in politics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You got it. That's wonderful. And I'll tell you that not only that, not only is it not implemented because of money, it's not even discussed. All right? So I'm saying here and no one disputes me, we are spending twice as much per person on healthcare, right? And yet 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, and our life expectancy is lower than virtually every other major country. Do you think that might be an issue that we'd be discussing?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, if a single politician discusses it to get punished for it. So there needs to be a mass movement and probably, I mean from my perspective, it has to come from the very top. It has to come from the president. And the president has to be a populist president where they don't care about the parties with the rich people. They just speak out because they know it's a popular message and they know it's the right thing. So speaking of that, you had a historic campaign run for president in 2016, and in the eyes of many people, mine included, you were screwed over by the DNC, especially the WikiLeaks emails showed. What's your just looking back feelings about that? And you're angry, are upset?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Democrats, I had one supporter, I had no governor supporting me. I think maybe a few people in the house. But we took on the whole political establishment and we did... We got millions of votes. And the ideas that we brought forth were ideas that they had to eventually deal with in one way or another. And if you look at the American Rescue Plan, which I'm proud to have helped write during the midst of COVID, a lot of the ideas that we fought forward were implemented in that bill. And I want to make them obviously permanent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you almost won. And a lot of people thought that you would win against Donald Trump.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And you know what? Working class people should feel angry, but they should make sure that their anger is directed in the right direction and not against people who are even worse off the nail, which is what demagogues like Trump always do. So I think we had, as I went around the country then, and now we have a lot of support from working class people who understand that there is something wrong. And this is an incredible fact that no one talks about. All right, I'm going to ask you a question. Are you ready for this Lex?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Here we go. Over the last 50 years, there's been a massive increase in worker productivity as a result of technology, right? Everyone agrees to that. And I don't know exactly what is, but the worker today is producing a lot more than the work of 50 years ago doing something similar. Is the worker today in real inflation accounted for dollars making more money than that work 50 years ago?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of close arguments there, but your point is well taken. It's either the same or a little bit higher or a little bit lower, depending on the statistics. It has not increased significantly, and the wealth inequality has increased significantly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>today making 300 times more than their workers. You got three people on top owning more wealth on the bottom half of American society. So that's why people are angry and they're worried that their kids may have a lowest standard of living than they in the country in the history of the world. So there's a lot of anger out there, and I think we tap some of that anger in a constructive way, essentially saying, you know what? We don't need so few to have so much in wealth and power. Let's distribute it more fairly in America.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got to get back to 2016 because it's such a historic moment. So there's a lot of fans of yours that wanted you to keep fighting. Because you forgave in the end the establishment and joined them in support. And your fans wanted to keep fighting for a takeover, for a progressive takeover, the Democratic Party. If you just look back and had to do it all over again, what would you do different?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think Donald Trump is an extremely dangerous person trying to undermine American democracy. So I can't support him. Hillary Clinton, obviously his views are very, very different than mine. But that in that moment, that's where politics becomes really tricky and it ain't easy. And sometimes you have to do things that you're not really all that excited about. But I think it was right to try to do what I could to prevent Trump from getting elected. And in 2020 I did the same with Biden and we had more success with Biden than we had with Clinton.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's this interesting story about a long time coming meeting between you and Obama in 2018, I believe. So Ari Rabin-Havt, who was a former deputy campaign manager, wrote a great book I would say about you called The Fighting Soul: On the Road with Bernie Sanders. And he tells many great stories, but one of them is your meeting with Obama. And he says that Obama told you, Bernie... I wish I could do a good Obama impression. Bernie, you're an Old Testament prophet. A moral voice for our party giving us guidance. Here's the thing though, prophets don't get to be king. Kings have to make choices, prophets don't. Are you willing to make those choices? Basically Obama's making the case that you have to sort of moderate your approach in order to win. So was Obama right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look, and again, that's why politics is very, very fascinating. Sometimes you can run and lose and you really win if your goal is not just individual power, but transforming society. One of my heroes, you mentioned Martin Luther King Jr. who is one of my heroes. Another one of my heroes is Eugene Victor Debs. Does that ring a bell?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yes.<|eot_id|>"}

We have seen in terms of civil rights, massive changes. Change happens when people at the grassroots level demand that... We talked about a healthcare a moment ago, we will get universal Medicare for all when millions of people make it clear that's what they want. So I believe politics starts at the grassroots level, and that's how you got to bring about change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So just to go back to Obama though, in many ways, he too is a singular historic figure in American politics who has brought about a lot of change.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that is a huge accomplishment. And I think he has had some significant achievements in his presidential tenure. He and I did disagree on a number of issues. I think he will tell you, I think his public stance is that, yeah, if you have to start all over again, he would do Medicare for all single payer. But where we are right now, the best he could do is the Affordable Care Act. Well, we disagree on that and we disagree on other things, but I think he deserves an enormous amount of credit for what he has accomplished.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he, like you, also gave a damn good speech opposing the Iraq war before running for president.

They want it all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I have to ask you about capitalism, the pros and cons. So you wrote a book, It's Okay To Be Angry About Capitalism. That is a thorough, rigorous criticism of I would say hypercapitalism, a certain kind of capitalism that you argue that we are existing in today in the United States. But a lot of people would attribute to capitalism all the amazing technological innovations over the past 70 plus years that have contributed to increase in quality of life in GDP, decrease in poverty, decrease in infant mortality, increase in expected life expectancy. So how do you see the tension, the pros of capitalism and the cons of capitalism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the street or developing a new drug. So I think we have gone a little bit far, and you're right, in talking about the book was an attack on I call, you call hypercapitalism or ubercapitalism. But right now, and this is not an American issue, this is a global issue. It's not an accident that Musk is over there in Saudi Arabia talking to the trillionaire families in the mid-East, these guys, Putin and his friends, you got probably not more than five, 10,000 extraordinarily wealthy families who have unbelievable economic power over 7 billion people on this planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Elon Musk is actually an interesting case because he's investing all the money back into the businesses. So I think there is a balance to be struck and you just spoke to it, which is we can still celebrate even big companies that are bringing wealth to the world, that are building cool stuff, that are improving quality of life. But we can question of why is it that the working class does not have a living wage? In many cases, and sort of trying to find that balance.<|eot_id|>"}

What kind of technologies out there can really cut back on carbon emissions? So I hope we focus on some of the most important issues that impact humanity, but reward innovators. I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem when three people end up owning more wealth at the bottom half of American society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe you can briefly speak to something you tweeted recently about Donald Trump going to McDonald's and the minimum wage, I believe of $7.50. Can you just speak to that tweet?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>reporter said, what do you think about raising the federal minimum wage? And he's, \"Oh, these are great workers. I love McDonald's and so forth.\" He didn't answer the question Well, I think that in the richest country in the history of the world, if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty. And that means we should have a federal minimum wage, not absurdly seven and a quarter an hour, but in my view, $17 an hour. Will that solve all the economic problems for working-class people? No, it won't. It'll help. It'll help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Since running for president, you've often been attacked, especially from the right about being worth I believe $2 million and owning three houses. So from my perspective, the answer to that is most of your wealth has been earned from writing books and selling those books. And you are one of the most famous politicians in the world. And so your wealth in the context in comparison to other people of that fame level and other politicians is actually quite modest. So what's your response usually to those attacks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>got a six-year term. You know what? Let's buy a house. So we bought a house and guess what? Like many thousands of people in the state of Vermont, I have a summer camp. It's a nice one on Lake Champlain. That's it. Now how did I get the money? You're right. I wrote two best-selling books, including this book on capitalism. It was New York Times bestseller for a while. And also another book was a youth book. I make, I don't know, $175,000 a year. And that's more or less how I became the zillionaire that I am.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I should also mention that sometimes the word mansion is used and I think your residences are quite modest, at least-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Normal houses and they're not... They're middle-class houses. Very nice house.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you started in politics I read you are worth $1,100.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that much. That's right. Has the increase in wealth changed your ability to relate to the working class?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of not worrying about a financial disaster, that's gone and that is enormous. I maybe as much or more than any other member of the Senate work hard not only for, but with working-class people. I'm chairman of the committee deals with labor issues. We have been involved probably in dozens of strikes all over this country. I've been on picket lines. So I do my best. It's a very easy trap to fall into. You can get separated from ordinary people and their struggles. Not hard to do. I try as hard as I can not to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So sometimes people say, can money buy happiness? I think I agree with you that worry, sort of being able to fill up your car and not worry about how much it's going to cost or be able to get a- And not worry about how much it's going to cost or be able to get food for dinner and not worry about how much it's going to cost. Or even, I've been poor most of my life, but I've been very fortunate recently to have enough wealth to not worry about healthcare, to have insurance, and be able to afford an emergency room visit. And that worry is just such a giant lift off your shoulders.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about that. But your point is, again, to me, I don't like big fancy cars or big fancy homes, don't go on... My wife will tell you we've not been on a real vacation for God knows how long, because I work pretty hard. But the major thing about having money, which is enormously important, is just what you said. I don't have to worry. If somebody in my family gets sick, I don't have to worry about that. I don't have to worry about putting food on the table or paying the mortgage. So, that's what money has done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Let me ask you about the future of the Democratic Party. So one of the biggest impacts you've had is you've been in the fuel, the catalyst for the increase of the progressive caucus, the progressive movement within the Democratic Party. Do you think that is the future, the progressives, even Democratic socialist leaders will take over the party?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>his ideas. Most working class people don't think we should give tax breaks to billionaires or worry about the size of Arnold Palmer's genitalia. But they are angry, people are angry. And the Democrats have not responded effectively to that anger. So, the struggle that we are waging right now is the future of the Democratic Party. Will it be a party of the working class and represent working class issues, whether you black or white or Latino or Asian or whatever you may be? Or will it be a corporately dominated party? That's the struggle we're in right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you consider running in 2024? From my perspective, I would've loved it if you ran. I think you would've had a great chance of winning. Not just the primary, but the presidency.<|eot_id|>"}

And that I did not want to see. So sometimes in life, and I know that a lot of younger people don't agree with me, but you got to make choices which are painful. So I strongly supported Biden, because I liked his domestic record. He's done some good things against a lot of opposition. And I'm supporting Kamala right now. But I'm doing my best to see that a dangerous guy like Donald Trump does not become president.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the hope for you is that there will be future candidates that are populist, that are progressive?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about AOC. She's become one of the most influential voices for the progressive cause in the United States. You two had a great conversation on your podcast and in general, you work together. So, what to you is most impressive about her?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>she had an approach to people, which was beautiful. I mean, it wasn't phony, it was real. But to be a politician, you got to know how to... You could be a great intellectual, but you can't relate to people. She relates well to people. And so, I think both from a personality perspective, from an intellect perspective, from an ideological perspective, she helped create the Green New Deal concept, the need to create jobs as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. Strong advocate for Medicare for all workers rights. So, I'm a big fan of Alexandria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is the most powerful enduring impact you've had on American politics? Looking back, you've been in it for quite a bit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is, \"The world is the way it is. It always will be this way. We got the wealth, we got the power. And don't think of anything else. This is the way it is. You have no power. Give up.\" They don't say it quite that way, but that's really what the intent is. And what we showed is, guess what? Running an outsider campaign, we took on the Democratic establishment, we came close to winning it. And we did win 23 states. And the ideas that we're talking about are the ideas that working-class people, young people believe in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you showed that it's possible to win. And that's an idea that will resonate for decades to come.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And out of that came dozens of candidates now in the House of Representatives, people on city council, people on state legislature who did win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we mentioned about the worry of getting sick, the worry of life that many people in the working class are suffering from.

That was stunning to me, that suddenly, I was in a hospital bed. I have a great deal of compassion for people as we speak, who are in nursing homes, having a hard time walking. Maybe your mental agility is slipping a little bit. That's tough. That's what worries me. We are all going to die, and that's that.

And where the poor rule, that is democracy.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
