And ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary tech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the tech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential voices in the tech world, including at the intersection of technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the best possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small tech, what would it be? What would it look like?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>then look, it's just I think, clearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea that we're talking about, I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction of people have that? To me, the preference falsification is really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? Because the dynamical system that is the difference between those two is fascinating. Throughout history the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting. Everybody was following the line until not. But for sure, privately, there was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where this is the bureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really bothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden there's a trigger that allows the vibe shift to happen. To me, the interesting question here is, what is the landscape of private thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how much dormant energy is there for this roaring twenties? What people are like, no more bullshit, let's get done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that part is also happening right now. And again, case study one of that would be Elon, and who turns out in truly massive following.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he has done that over and over in different industries, not just saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit in the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And it's like, well, but then there's the test. Is it crazy or is it the truth?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>precepts of what they're told they have to do to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the ways to avoid that in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between what's said in private and what's said in public small.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say, on edge on a lot of things. And that 60% is pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I would love to see where that pivot goes because there's internal battles happening right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>revolutionary. We must double down and we must celebrate murders in the street of health insurance executives. And that right now is a real fight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If I could tell you a little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a historian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking about having a podcast, on doing a podcast, and he eventually said that, \"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I just don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are the particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would surprise a lot of people if I said who it is. This is a person who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80 plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Nevertheless, he just doesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just have a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk to your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are feeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts, how quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you mentioned, 20, 60, 20 matters, and the contents of the private groups matters, and the dynamics of how that shifts matters. Because it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. Where just, there's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these new vibes, to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold.<|eot_id|>"}

And so, you're a farm boy in Wisconsin, or a Black American whose ancestors arrived here on a slave ship, 300 years ago, in Louisiana, or a Cambodian immigrant in the Bronx, and you are a kid, or a Jewish immigrant, or from a very successful Jewish family, and for three generations, you and your parents and grandparents went to Harvard, and what all of those groups know is the system that has been created is not for them. It's designed specifically to exclude them, and then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, yeah, let's bring in more foreigners. So, anyway, so the short version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the \"high-skilled immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also having the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another word for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative action conversation. And you need to actually deal with this at substance and to see what's actually happening to people, you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for high-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took over both the education process and the hiring process.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to be more people saying, yay, we need more American- born hires.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on this and not saying anything, and what I was...

And tell me if you saw one. I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart kids who are already here into these educational institutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true, I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it was literally, it was like the proponents of high-skilled immigrant... And again, this was me for a very long time. I kind of took myself by surprise on this because I had the much, say, simpler version of this story for a very long... Like I said, I've been in Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about, it never actually worked. But I've been on the other side of this one. But I was literally sitting there being like, all right, which of these super geniuses, many of whom by the way are very successful, high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled immigrants, which of these super geniuses are going to say, actually we have this incredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people, I'm talking about native-born Americans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure, those four groups,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But also white people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and also white people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're making that case are often not making it in a way that's... Making it in quite a radical way, let's put it this way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. But you have this interesting thing, you have a split between the sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. And I'm using air quote for people listening to audio, I'm making quotes in the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can. One side has all the certified experts, the other side just has a bunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite know how to explain it. And what was so unusual about the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of the Supreme Court is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record. They actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get... Because if you don't have experts, what do you have? You know something is wrong, but you have primarily an emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it into the words and tables and charts that a certified expert can? No, you can't, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. And so, it's just like, all right... Now, by the way, look, I think there are ways to square the circle, I think there's a way to have our cake and eat it too, I think there'd be many ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with high-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is under much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for universities to do that, they are still doing it, but they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part... That's happening for a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate lawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court rulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just is a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so, there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let me add one more nuance to it though, that makes it even more complicated. So, the cliche is we're going to brain drain the world, you've heard that? We're going to take all the smart people from all over the world, we're going to bring them here, we're going to educate them, and then we're going to keep them, and then they're going to raise their families here, create businesses here, create jobs here, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the cliche, that's a super positive thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Okay, so what happens to the rest of the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They lose?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious, highly conscientious, highly energetic, high achieving, high IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that many, and they all come here, and they aren't where they would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So, it's almost impossible for us here to have that conversation, in part because we become incredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just simply all the same, which is a whole thing we could talk about, but also we are purely the beneficiary of this effect. We are brain draining the world, not the other way around. There's only four... So, if you look at the flow of high-skilled immigration over time, there's only four permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration places people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, Australia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so, for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four countries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk about this I've discovered, because the Eurozone is, whatever, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over time have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I think it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've been migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this really hit the fan was in Greece. So, Greece falls into chaos, disaster, and then you're running the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic development plan together, all of your smart young kids have left, what are you going to do? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. In part because of this, because we enthusiastically recruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining Ukraine for a long time, but also, of course, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, when it comes time for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it going to have the talent base even that it had five years ago, is a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, we have brain drained a lot of really smart people out of Russia, a lot of them are here, over the last 30 years. And so, there's this thing, it's actually really funny if you think about it, the one thing that we know to be the height of absolute evil that the West ever did was colonization and resource extraction. So, we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and the English and everybody else went and had these colonies, and then went in and we took all the oil, and we took all the diamonds, or we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is. Well, for some reason we realized that that's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter, for some reason we think it's completely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious and beautiful and wonderful and the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral justice of our time to do it, and we don't think for one second what we're doing to the countries that we're pulling all these people out of. And this is one of these things, I don't know, maybe we're just going to live in this delusional state forever, and we'll just keep doing it, and it'll keep benefiting us, and we just won't care what happens, but I think there may come... This is one of these submarines 10 feet under the water line, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly realize, oh my God, what are we doing? We need the rest of the world to succeed too, we need these other countries to flourish. We don't want to be the only successful country in the middle of just complete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and we extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all of humanity. It's interesting, this is one of those truths where you just speak and it resonates, and I didn't even think about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, you were sitting during the holiday season, just boiling over. So, all that said, there's still to use some good to the H-1B?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Come all the way around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... there's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance, which is mostly in the valley we don't use H-1Bs anymore, mostly we use O1s. So, there's a separate class of these, and the O1 is like this... It turns out the O1 is the super genius visa. So, the O1 is basically our founder... When we have somebody from anywhere in the world, and they've invented a breakthrough new technology, and they want to come to the US to start a company, they come in through an O1 Visa. And that actually, it's a fairly high bar, it's a high acceptance rate, but it's a pretty high bar, and they do a lot of work, and you have to put real work into it, really prove your case. Mostly what's happened with the H-1B Visa program is that it has gone to basically two categories of employers. One is basically a small set of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies that you would think, and then the other is it goes to these, what they call the mills, the consulting mills. And so, there's these set of companies with names, I don't want to pick on companies, but names like Cognizant, that hire, basically have their business model is bringing in primarily Indians in large numbers, and they often have offices next to company-owned housing, and they'll have organizations that are literally thousands of Indians living and working in the US, and they do basically call it mid-tier IT consulting. So, these folks, they're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a or 100,000 a year, not the 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, in practice, the startups, basically little tech as we call it, or the startup world, mainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point, and mainly can't, because the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then, again, you get to the underlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, Amazon, Amazon's... I love Amazon. But they're a big powerful company, they've got more money than God, they've got resources, they've got long-term planning horizon, they do big profound things over decades at a time, they could, or any of these other companies, could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you'll notice they don't do that, they bring in 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so, you've got a question there, and then these mills, there's lots of questions around them, and whether that's even an ethical way... I don't want to say they're unethical, but there's questions around exactly what the trade-offs are there. And this like is a Pandora's box that really nobody really wanted to be opened. To play devil's advocate in all this, in terms of national immigration issues, none of this is a top end issue, just because the numbers are small, and so I don't think, the administration has said this is not a priority of theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is, there is actually a lot of complexity and nuance here. Like I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues who came over on H-1Bs or O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens, and every single one of them was... Not every single one. A lot of them were enthusiastic to defend the honor of immigrants throughout this whole period. And they said to me, it's like, well, Marc, how can we more clearly express the importance of high school immigration to the US? And I was like, I think you can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent. Do you want to inflame the issue or do you want to diffuse the issue? I think the answer is to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one more positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up on the university some more. Do you know about the National Merit Scholarship System, have you heard about this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not really, can you explain?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, there's a system that was created during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars, and it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the 50s or 60s when... It was people in government actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an idea as that sounds today. And so, it's basically a national talent search for, basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify basically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country. By the way, completely regardless of other characteristics. So, there's no race, gender, or any other aspect to it, it's just going for straight intelligence. It uses, first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory SAT that you take, and then the SAT. So, it uses those scores, that is the scoring, it's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. They use the SAT as a proxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to 1% of the population of the kids, of 18 year olds in an given year, who score highest on the PSAT, and then they further qualify down to the 0.5% that also replicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500. So, it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the best and the brightest. How many of our great and powerful universities use this as a scouting system? Our universities all have sports teams, they all have national scouting, they have full-time scouts who go out and they go to every high school and they try to find all the great basketball players and bring them into the NCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities use the National Merit System to go do a talent search for the smartest kids and just bring them in?<|eot_id|>"}

And I'm not special, it doesn't identify genius, I think you want to search for genius. And you want to create measures that find genius of all different kinds, speaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and over, defend immigrants, yes, but say we should hire more and more native-born.<|eot_id|>"}

Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite things about Yann LeCun? I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world.

First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the LLM path to AGI know. His basic notion is that there AI needs to have some physical understanding of the physical world, and that's very difficult to achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations of LLMs and so on.
