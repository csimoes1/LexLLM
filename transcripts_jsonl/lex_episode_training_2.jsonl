And ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Marc Andreessen, his second time on the podcast. Marc is a visionary tech leader and investor who fundamentally shaped the development of the internet and the tech industry in general over the past 30 years. He's the co-creator of Mosaic, the first widely used web browser, co-founder of Netscape, co-founder of the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and is one of the most influential voices in the tech world, including at the intersection of technology and politics. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Marc Andreessen. All right, let's start with optimism. If you were to imagine the best possible 1 to 2 years, 2025, '26 for tech, for big tech and small tech, what would it be? What would it look like? Lay out your vision for the best possible scenario trajectory for America?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>part because many of the best scientists and engineers in those fields come to the US. And so we have all of the preconditions for just a monster boom. I could see economic growth going way up, I could see productivity growth going way up, rate of technology adoption going way up. And then we can do a global tour, if you like. But basically, all of our competitors have profound issues, and we could go through them one by one, but the competitive landscape just is ... It's like it's remarkable how much better positioned we are for growth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the humans themselves? Almost a philosophical question. I travel across the world and there's something about the American spirit, the entrepreneurial spirit that's uniquely intense in America. I don't know what that is. I've talked to Saagar who claims it might be the Scots-Irish blood that runs through the history of America. What is it? You, at the heart of Silicon Valley, is there something in the water? Why is there this entrepreneurial spirit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So is this a family show or am I allowed to swear?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You can say whatever the fuck you want.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay. So the great TV show, succession, the show of course, which you were intended to root for exactly zero of the characters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The best line from succession was in the final episode of the first season when the whole family's over in Logan Roy's ancestral homeland of Scotland. And they're at this castle for some wedding. And Logan is just completely miserable because he's been in New York for 50 years, he's totally miserable being back in Scotland. And he gets in some argument with somebody and he says, finally just says, \"My God, I cannot wait to get out of here and go back to America where we can fuck without condoms.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Was that a metaphor or ... Okay<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And every night on the nightly news, it was lines around the block, energy crisis, depression, inflation. And then Reagan came in and Reagan was a very controversial character at the time. And he came in and he's like, \"Yep, nope, it's morning in America and we're the shining city on the hill, and we're going to do it.\" And he did it, and we did it. And the national spirit came roaring back and roared really hard for a full decade. I think that's exactly what ... I think we'll see, but I think that's what could happen here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I just did a super long podcast on Milton Friedman with Jennifer Burns, who's this incredible professor at Stanford, and he was part of the Reagan ... So there's a bunch of components to that, one of which is economic, and one of which maybe you can put a word on it of not to be romantic or anything, but freedom, individual freedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and just in general, individualism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The way I look at, it's like all of our problems are self-inflicted. Decline is a choice. All of our problems are basically demoralization campaigns, basically people telling us, people in positions of authority telling us that, \"We shouldn't stand out, we shouldn't be adventurous, we shouldn't be exciting, we shouldn't be exploratory, we shouldn't this, that, and the other thing. And we should feel bad about everything that we do.\" And I think we've lived through a decade where that's been the prevailing theme. And I think quite honestly, as of November, I think people are done with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we could go on a tangent of a tangent, since we're talking about individualism, and that's not all that it takes. You've mentioned in the past the book The Ancient City by, if I could only pronounce the name, French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges. I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. All right. From the 19th century. Anyway, you said this is an important book to understand who we are and where we come from.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>largely prides itself on no longer being religious in that way. We being the sort of most fully evolved, modern secular experts, scientists and so forth have basically re-evolved or fallen back on the exact same religious structure that the Indo-Europeans had, specifically ancestor worship, which is identity politics and nature worship, which is environmentalism. And so we have actually worked our way all the way back to their cult religions without realizing it. And it just goes to show that in some ways we have fallen far from the family tree, but in some cases we're exactly the same.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You kind of described this progressive idea of wokeism and so on as worshiping ancestors.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Identity politics is worshiping ancestors. It's tagging newborn infants with either benefits or responsibilities or levels of condemnation based on who their ancestors were. The Indo-Europeans would've recognized it on sight. We somehow think it's super socially progressive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it is not.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's a real downside. Full traditionalism is communitarianism, it's ethnic particularism, it's ethnic chauvinism, it's this incredible level of resistance to change. It just doesn't get you anywhere. It may be good and fine at the level of an individual tribe, but as a society living in the modern world, you can't evolve, you can't advance, you can't participate in all the good things that have happened. And so I think probably this is one of those things where extremists on either side is probably a bad idea, but this needs to be approached in a sophisticated and nuanced way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the beautiful picture you painted of the roaring 20s, how can the Trump administration play a part in making that future happen?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>up basically being this comprehensive message that says, \"You're terrible and if you try to do anything, you're terrible and fuck you.\" And the Biden administration reached the full pinnacle of that in our time. They got really bad on many fronts at the same time. And so just relieving that and getting back to a reasonably optimistic, constructive, pro-growth frame of mind, there's so much pent-up energy and potentially in the American system, that alone is going to, I think cause growth and spirit to take off. And then there's a lot of things proactively that could be done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you relieve that? To what degree has the thing you describe ideologically permeated government and permeated big companies?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>imposed by NASDAQ, your stock exchange imposing this stuff on you, and then the court, whatever, the Court of Appeals just nuked that. So these things basically are being ripped down one by one. And what's on the other side of it is basically finally being able to get back to everything that everybody always wanted to do, which is run their companies, have great products, have happy customers, succeed, achieve, outperform, and work with the best and the brightest and not be made to feel bad about it. And I think that's happening in many areas of American society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's great to hear that Peter Thiel is fundamentally a diversity hire.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sometimes. I think in fairness, they have trouble telling when I'm joking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned the Hollywood folks, maybe people in Silicon Valley and the vibe shift. Maybe you can speak to preference falsification. What do they actually believe? How many of them actually hate Trump? What percent of them are feeling this vibe shift and are interested in creating the roaring 20s in the way they've described?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have beliefs is mostly wrong. I think that most people just go along, and I think even most high status people just go along. And I think maybe the most high status people are the most prone to just go along because they're the most focused on status. And the way I would describe that is one of the great forbidden philosophers of our time is the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. And amidst his madness, he had this extremely interesting articulation. He was an insane lunatic murderer, but he was also a Harvard super genius. Not that those are in conflict.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Shots fired man.<|eot_id|>"}

I mean, they probably think they have rocks solid beliefs, but they don't actually have some inner core of rock solid beliefs. And then they kind of watch reality change around them and try to figure out how to keep their beliefs correct. I don't think that's what happens. I think what happens is they conform to the belief system around them, and I think most of the time they're not even aware that they're basically part of a herd.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible that the surface chatter ...<|eot_id|>"}

When you go outside the inner circle of one, two, three, four people who you really trust, then you start to conform. But inside there, inside the mind, there is an actual belief or a struggle, attention within New York Times or with the listener. For the listener, there's a slow smile that overtook Mark Andreessen's face.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the conferences, no, there's none of that. What there is that all of the heretical conversations, anything that challenges the status quo, any heretical ideas and any new idea is a heretical idea, any deviation is either discussed one-on-one, face-to-face, it's like a whisper network or it's like a real life social network. There's a secret handshake. Which is like, okay, you meet somebody and each other a little bit, but not well, and you're both trying to figure out if you can talk to the other person openly or whether you have to be fully conformist. It's a joke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, humor 100%.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Somebody cracks a joke, right? Somebody cracks a joke. If the other person laughs, the conversation is on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bankman-Fried term, one of the chivalrous. It has to be up against one of the things, one of the things that you're absolutely required to believe to be the dinner parties. And then at that point, what happens is have a peer-to-peer network. You have a one-to-one connection with somebody, then you have your little conspiracy of thought criminality, and then you've probably been through this, you have your network of thought criminals, and then they have their network of thought criminals, and then you have this delicate mating dance as to whether you should bring the thought criminals together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the fundamental mechanism of the dance is humor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's humor. Well, of course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Memes. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

But then group chats grew up to be the equivalent of Samizdat. Anybody who grew up in the Soviet Union under communism, note, they had the hard version of this. It's like, how do you know who you could talk to? And then how do you distribute information? And again, that was the hard authoritarian version of this. And then we've been living through this weird mutant soft authoritarian version, but with some of the same patterns.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And WhatsApp allows you to scale and make it more efficient to build on these groups of heretical ideas bonded by humor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>disappearing messages, which hit Signal probably four or five years ago and hit WhatsApp three or four years ago. And then the combination of encryption and disappearing messages I think really unleashed it. Well, then there's the fight over the length of disappearing messages. And so it's like I often get behind on my thing, so I set to seven day disappearing messages and my friends who are like, no, that's way too much risk. It's got to be a day. And then every once in a while somebody will set to five minutes before they send something particularly inflammatory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, 100%. One of the things that bothers me about WhatsApp, the choice is between 24 hours and seven days, one day or seven days. And I have to have an existential crisis deciding whether I can last for seven days with what I'm about to say.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know that everything just shifts back into public, but a tremendous amount of the verboten conversations can now shift back into public view. And this is one of those things, quite frankly, even if I was opposed to what people are saying, and I'm sure I am in some cases, I would argue still net better for society that those things happen in public instead of private. Does you want to know? And then look, it's just I think, clearly much healthier to live in a society in which people are not literally scared of what they're saying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, to push back, to come back to this idea that we're talking about, I do believe that people have beliefs and thoughts that are heretical, like a lot of people. I wonder what fraction of people have that? To me, the preference falsification is really interesting. What is the landscape of ideas that human civilization has in private as compared to what's out in public? Because the dynamical system that is the difference between those two is fascinating. Throughout history the fall of communism and multiple regimes throughout Europe is really interesting. Everybody was following the line until not. But for sure, privately, there was a huge number of boiling conversations happening, where this is the bureaucracy of communism, the corruption of communism, all of that was really bothering people more and more and more and more. And all of a sudden there's a trigger that allows the vibe shift to happen. To me, the interesting question here is, what is the landscape of private thoughts and ideas and conversations that are happening under the surface of Americans? Especially, my question is how much dormant energy is there for this roaring twenties? What people are like, no more bullshit, let's get done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we'll go through the theory of preference falsification just to-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. By the way, amazing. The books on this is fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that they're enforcing the actual ideology of the workers of the world uniting. It's that they're enforcing compliance and compliance with the regime. And you fuck you, you will comply. And so anyway, that's the other side of that. And of course, we have lived in the last decade through a lot of both of those. I think anybody listening to this could name a series of slogans that we've all been forced to chant for the last decade that everybody knows at this point are just simply not true. I'll let the audience speculate on their own group chats.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Send Marc your memes online as well, please.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>emotional views on them. And so when you really get the revolution, it's when you get the elites lined up with, or either the current elites change or the new set of elites, a new set of counter elites, basically come along and say, \"No, there's actually a different and better way to live.\" And then the people basically decide to follow the counter elite. So that's the other dimension to it. And of course, that part is also happening right now. And again, case study one of that would be Elon, and who turns out in truly massive following.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he has done that over and over in different industries, not just saying crazy shit online, but saying crazy shit in the realm of space, in the realm of autonomous driving, in the realm of AI, just over and over and over again. Turns out saying crazy shit is one of the ways to do a revolution and to actually make progress.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And it's like, well, but then there's the test. Is it crazy or is it the truth?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>basically incredibly corrupt elites wondering why they don't have the masses anymore, and a set of new elites that are running away with things. And so we're living through this incredible applied case study of these ideas. And if there's a moral of the story, it is I think fairly obvious, which is it's a really bad idea for a society to wedge itself into a position in which most people don't believe the fundamental precepts of what they're told they have to do to be good people like that. That is just not a good state to be in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the ways to avoid that in the future maybe, is to keep the delta between what's said in private and what's said in public small.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>point there's a contest and then, and then the question is, what happens in the middle? What happens in the 60%? And it is kind of my point. It's not even really does the 60% change their beliefs as much as it's like, okay, what is the thing that that 60% now decides to basically fall into step with? And in the valley, that 60% for the last decade decided to be woke and extremely, I would say, on edge on a lot of things. And that 60% is pivoting in real time. They're just done. They've just had it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I would love to see where that pivot goes because there's internal battles happening right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we need to go back to the center. We need to de-radicalize because we've lost the people. We've lost the people in the middle, and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election. And then the other half of them are saying, no, we weren't true to our principles. We were too weak. We were too soft. We must become more revolutionary. We must double down and we must celebrate murders in the street of health insurance executives. And that right now is a real fight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If I could tell you a little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit, there's a professor, a historian, I won't say who, who I admire deeply, love his work. He's kind of a heretical thinker. And we were talking about having a podcast, on doing a podcast, and he eventually said that, \"You know what, at this time, given your guest list, I just don't want the headache of being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution.\" And I asked, \"Who are the particular figures in this guest list?\" He said, \"Trump.\" And the second one, he said, \"That you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin.\" So I just don't want the headache. Now, I fully believe it would surprise a lot of people if I said who it is. This is a person who's not bothered by the guest list. And I should also say that 80 plus percent of the guest list is left wing. Nevertheless, he just doesn't want the headache. And that speaks to the thing that you've kind of mentioned, that you just don't want the headache. You just want to just have a pleasant morning with some coffee and talk to your fellow professors. And I think a lot of people are feeling that in universities and in other contexts, in tech companies. And I wonder if that shifts, how quickly that shifts? And there, the percentages you mentioned, 20, 60, 20 matters, and the contents of the private groups matters, and the dynamics of how that shifts matters. Because it's very possible, nothing really changes in universities and in major tech companies. Where just, there's a kind of excitement right now for potential revolution and these new ideas, these new vibes, to reverberate through these companies and universities, but it's possible the wall will hold.<|eot_id|>"}

I mean, think of the term academic freedom, and then think of what these people have done to it. It's gone. That entire thing was fake and is completely rotten. And these people are completely giving up the entire moral foundation of the system that's been built for them, which by the way, is paid for virtually 100% by taxpayer money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the inkling of hope in this?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no, no, no, no. Think about what happens next. Okay, so let's go through it. So the universities are funded by four primary sources of federal funding. The big one is a federal student loan program, which is in the many trillions of dollars at this point, and then only spiraling way faster than inflation. That's number one. Number two is federal research funding, which is also very large. And you probably know that when a scientist at the university gets a research grant, the university rakes as much as 70% of the money for central uses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you get progress. And of course, below that is what happens is this is the process of evolution. Why does anything ever get better? Things are tested and tried, and then the things that are good survive. And so these places, they've been allowed to cut themselves off, both from evolution of the institutional level and evolution of the individual level as shown by the just widespread abuse of tenure. And so we've just stalled out. We built an ossified system, an ossified, centralized, corrupt system, where we're surprised by the results. They are not fixable in their current form.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I disagree with you on that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's all of these third-party censorship bureaus.

It's truly disturbing. I don't think anybody wants this kind of overreach of power for government, including perhaps people that are participating in it.

It's a study of power and power dynamics, like you mentioned, looking at the actual reality of the machinery of power. From everything you've seen now in government, but also in companies, what are some interesting things you can continue to say about the dynamics of power, the jostling for power that happens inside these institutions?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>New York Times comes at you, it's also very hard to stay in the seat. If the Senate comes at you, it's very hard to stay in the seat. So a reductionist version of this that is a good shorthand is who can get who fired? So who has more power? The newspaper columnist who makes $200,000 a year, or the CEO who makes $200 million a year/ and it's like, well, I know for sure that the columnist can get the CEO fired. I've seen that happen before I have yet to see a CEO get a columnist fired.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did anyone ever get from the Bill Ackman assault on journalism? So Bill really showed the bullshit that happens in journalism.<|eot_id|>"}

Now for the first time, the owner is showing up saying, \"Oh no, I'm actually in charge,\" and the reporters are saying, \"No, you're not.\" It is freaking on. And so again, the Machiavellian's mindset on this is like, okay, how is power actually exercised here? Can a guy who's even super rich and super powerful who even owns his own newspaper, can he stand up to a full scale assault, not only by his own reporters, but by every other journalism outlet who also now thinks he's the Antichrist?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he is trying to exercise power by speaking out publicly and so that's the game of power there.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he has set new rules. He's now at long last actually exercising prerogatives of an owner of a business, which is decide on the policies and staffing of the business. There are certain other owners of these publications that are doing similar things right now. He's the one I don't know so he's the one I can talk about. But there are others that are going through the same thing right now. And I think it's a really interesting open question in a fight between the employees and the employer it's not crystal clear that the employer wins that one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And just to stay on journalism for a second, we mentioned Bill Ackman. I just want to say put him in the category we mentioned before of a really courageous person. I don't think I've ever seen anybody so fearless in going after, in following what he believes in publicly. That's courage. Several things he's done publicly has been really inspiring. Just being courageous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What do you think is the most impressive example?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where he went after journalists whose whole incentive is to ... It's like kicking the beehive or whatever. You know what's going to follow and to do that. That's why it's difficult to challenge journalistic organizations because they're going to ... There's just so many mechanisms they use, including writing articles and get cited by Wikipedia and then drive the narrative and then they can get you fired, all this stuff. Bill Ackman, like a bad MFer just tweets these essays and just goes after them legally and also in the public eye. I don't know. That was truly inspiring. There's not many people like that in public and hopefully that inspires not just me, but many others to be courageous themselves.<|eot_id|>"}

And so the Liam Neeson skill set is getting more broadly diffused just by being able to watch and learn from him. So I think he's having a ... I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody who's really affecting how all this is playing out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But even set aside just courage and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>also where he worries about that. So a couple of things. One, it's his willingness to go out a bit and risk his relationship with his own investors. But I will tell you the other thing, which is his investors ... I know this for a fact. His investors have been remarkably supportive of him doing that. Because as it turns out, a lot of them actually agree with him. It's the same thing he does in his activism campaigns. He is able to be the tip of the spear on something that actually a lot more people agree with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I should start by saying I'm not a member of the new administration.

Maybe they're more cynical now. Maybe they're not willing to go through the drama. By the way, a lot of people in the first term came under their own withering legal assaults, and some of them went to prison. A lot of stuff happened. Lots of investigations, lots of legal fees, lots of bad press, lots of debanking by the way. A lot of the officials in the first Trump term got debanked, including the president's wife and son.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I heard you tell that story. That's insane. That's just insane.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is a big change from the gerontocracy that we've been under for the last 30 years. I think the caliber has been outstanding. And we could sit here and list tons and tons of people, but the people who are running. It's everything from the people who are running all the different departments at HHS. The number two at the Pentagon is Steve Feinberg, who's just an incredible legend of private equity, incredible capable guy. Actually two of my partners are going in who I both think are amazing. Many, many parts of the government the people are really impressive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that given the human being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say favoritism versus meritocracy. That there's circles of sycophancy that form. And if you're be able to be loyal and never oppose and just basically suck up to the president, that you'll get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good position to speak to the degree that's happening versus hiring based on merit and just getting great teams.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of that. So that's one thing. I would just say, I think the way to look at that ... And look, like I said, I don't want to predict what's going to happen once this whole thing starts unfolding. I would just say again, the caliber of the people who are showing up and getting the jobs, and then the fact that these are some of the most accomplished people in the business world and in the medical field. Jay Bhattacharya coming in to run NIH. I was part of the interview team for a lot of the HHS folks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice. Jay's amazing.

I happen to know Jay. I happen to know Jay, and I respect him enormously. And then he proved himself under this ... Talk about a guy who proved himself under extraordinary pressure over the last five years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then go radical under the pressure.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to have somebody like that in there. And so anyway, I have 30 of these stories now across all these different positions. And then to be quite honest, you do the compare and contrast to the last four years, and these people are not in the same ballpark, they're just wildly better. And so pound for pound this maybe the best team in the White House since, I don't even know, maybe the 90s, maybe the 30s, maybe the 50s. Maybe Eisenhower had a team like this or something, but there's a lot of really good people in there now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the potential for change is certainly extremely high.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so start by saying, again, disclaimer, I have to say, I'm not on DOGE, I'm not a member of DOGE.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We should say there's about 10 lawyers in the room, they're staring.

And rule of many is they do get to vote, the people do get to vote basically, and then essentially Congress and this permanent bureaucratic class in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people I think have the power to do all kinds of things here, and I think that would be the way I would wash it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The transparency. Elon, just by who he is is incentivized to be transparent, and show the bull shit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's going to be so exciting.

It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they build eight charging stations, or it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody and cost you $30 billion, so these boondoggles.

And what's in the constitution is the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, there has been an additional interpretation of appropriations applied by the courts and by the system, which is the executive branch not only needs Congress to appropriate X amount of money, the executive branch is not allowed to underspend.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I'm aware of this.

I actually think you headed it a really good point, which is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this because it makes them bad people, and they didn't start out wanting to be bad people.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>been in D.C. many times arguing with prior administrations about this, always on the side of trying to get more H-1B's and trying to get more high-skilled immigration. And I think that argument is very strong and very solid, and has paid off for the US in many, many ways. And we can go through it, but I think it's the argument everybody already knows, it's like the stock. You take any Silicon Valley person, you press the button and they tell you why we need to brain drain the world to get more H-1B's. So everybody gets that argument.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's basically, just to summarize, it's a mechanism by which you can get super smart people from the rest of the world, import them in, keep them here to increase the productivity of the US companies.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>All of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they've been running this, it's a very, very explicit, very, very clear program. This, of course, has been a third rail of things that people are not supposed to discuss under any circumstances. The thing that has really changed the tenor on this is I think two things. Number one, those Supreme Court cases, the Supreme Court ruled that they can no longer do that. I will tell you, I don't believe there's a single education institution in America that is conforming with the Supreme Court ruling, I think they're all flagrantly ignoring it. And we could talk about that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mostly because of momentum probably, or what?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so you can see where I'm heading with this. We have been in a 60-year social engineering experiment to exclude native-born people from the educational slots and jobs that high-skill immigration has been funneling foreigners into. And so it turns out it's not a victim-free thing, there's 100%, there's victims. Because why? There's only so many, for sure there's only so many education slots, and then for sure, there's only so many of these jobs. Google only hires so many, whatever, level seven engineers. And so that's the other side of it, and so you're a farm boy in Wisconsin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, that's the other side of it. And so, you're a farm boy in Wisconsin, or a Black American whose ancestors arrived here on a slave ship, 300 years ago, in Louisiana, or a Cambodian immigrant in the Bronx, and you are a kid, or a Jewish immigrant, or from a very successful Jewish family, and for three generations, you and your parents and grandparents went to Harvard, and what all of those groups know is the system that has been created is not for them. It's designed specifically to exclude them, and then what happens is all of these tech people show up in public and say, yeah, let's bring in more foreigners. So, anyway, so the short version of it is, you can't anymore, I don't think, just have the \"high-skilled immigration,\" conversation for either education or for employment without also having the DEI conversation. And then DEI is just another word for affirmative action, so it's the affirmative action conversation. And you need to actually deal with this at substance and to see what's actually happening to people, you needed to join these topics. And I think it is much harder to make the moral claim for high-skilled immigration given the extent to which DEI took over both the education process and the hiring process.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, first of all, that was brilliantly laid out, the nuance of it. So, just to understand, it's not so much a criticism of H-1B, high-skilled immigration, it's that there needs to be more people saying, yay, we need more American- born hires.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, I spent the entire Christmas holiday reading every message on this and not saying anything, and what I was... Which you know me well enough to know that's a serious level of-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that was very Zen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, thank you, thank you. No, it wasn't, there was tremendous rage on the other side of it, but I suppressed it. So, I was waiting for the dog that didn't bark, and the dog that didn't bark was I did not... And tell me if you saw one. I did not see a single example of somebody pounding the table for more high-skilled immigration, who was also pounding the table to go get more smart kids who are already here into these educational institutions and into these jobs. I didn't see a single one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true, I think I agree with that. There really was a divide.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it was literally, it was like the proponents of high-skilled immigrant... And again, this was me for a very long time. I kind of took myself by surprise on this because I had the much, say, simpler version of this story for a very long... Like I said, I've been in Washington many times under past presidents, lobbying for this. By the way, never made any progress, which we could talk about, it never actually worked. But I've been on the other side of this one. But I was literally sitting there being like, all right, which of these super geniuses, many of whom by the way are very successful, high-skilled immigrants or children of high-skilled immigrants, which of these super geniuses are going to say, actually we have this incredible talent source here in the country? Which again, to be clear, I'm not talking about white people, I'm talking about native-born Americans, whites, Asians, Jews, Blacks, for sure. For sure, for sure, those four groups,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But also white people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and also white people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People that are making the case for American-born hires are usually not also supporting H-1B. It's an extreme divide, and those people, they're making that case are often not making it in a way that's... Making it in quite a radical way, let's put it this way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. But you have this interesting thing, you have a split between the sides that I've noticed, which is one side has all of the experts. And I'm using air quote for people listening to audio, I'm making quotes in the air with my fingers as vigorously as I can. One side has all the certified experts, the other side just has a bunch of people who are like, they know that something is wrong and they don't quite know how to explain it. And what was so unusual about the Harvard UNC cases, by the way, in front of the Supreme Court is they actually had sophisticated lawyers for the first time in a long time actually put all this evidence together and actually put it in the public record. They actually had experts, which is just really rare. Generally what you get is you get... Because if you don't have experts, what do you have? You know something is wrong, but you have primarily an emotional response. You feel it, but can you put it into the words and tables and charts that a certified expert can? No, you can't, that's not who you are. That doesn't mean that you're wrong, and it also doesn't mean that you have less of a moral stance. And so, it's just like, all right... Now, by the way, look, I think there are ways to square the circle, I think there's a way to have our cake and eat it too, I think there'd be many ways to resolve this. I think, again, I think the way to do it is to look at these issues combined, look at DEI combined with high-skilled immigration. It so happens that DEI is under much more scrutiny today than it has been for probably 20 years, affirmative action is. The Supreme Court did just rule that it is not legal for universities to do that, they are still doing it, but they should stop. And then, there are more and more, you've seen more companies now also ditching their DEI programs, in part... That's happening for a bunch of reasons, but it's happening in part because a lot of corporate lawyers will tell you that the Supreme Court rulings in education either already apply to businesses, or it just is a clear foreshadowing the Supreme Court will rule on new cases that will ban in businesses. And so, there is a moment here to be able to look at this on both sides. Let me add one more nuance to it though, that makes it even more complicated. So, the cliche is we're going to brain drain the world, you've heard that? We're going to take all the smart people from all over the world, we're going to bring them here, we're going to educate them, and then we're going to keep them, and then they're going to raise their families here, create businesses here, create jobs here, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the cliche, that's a super positive thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Okay, so what happens to the rest of the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They lose?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, how fungible are people? How many highly ambitious, highly conscientious, highly energetic, high achieving, high IQ, super geniuses are there in the world? And if there's a lot, that's great, but if there just aren't that many, and they all come here, and they aren't where they would be otherwise, what happens to all those other places? So, it's almost impossible for us here to have that conversation, in part because we become incredibly uncomfortable as a society talking about the fact that people aren't just simply all the same, which is a whole thing we could talk about, but also we are purely the beneficiary of this effect. We are brain draining the world, not the other way around. There's only four... So, if you look at the flow of high-skilled immigration over time, there's only four permanent sinks of high-skilled immigration places people go. It's the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, Australia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's four of the five, five eyes. It's the major Anglosphere countries. And so, for those countries, this seems like a no-lose proposition, it's all the other countries that, basically, what we four countries have been doing is draining all the smart people out. It's actually much easier for people in Europe to talk about this I've discovered, because the Eurozone is, whatever, 28 countries, and within the Eurozone, the high-skilled people over time have been migrating to originally the UK, but also specifically I think it's the Netherlands, Germany, and France. But specifically, they've been migrating out of the peripheral Eurozone countries. And the one where this really hit the fan was in Greece. So, Greece falls into chaos, disaster, and then you're running the government in Greece and you're trying to figure out how to put an economic development plan together, all of your smart young kids have left, what are you going to do? By the way, this is a potential... I know you care a lot about Ukraine, this is a potential crisis for Ukraine. In part because of this, because we enthusiastically recruit Ukrainians, of course, and so we've been brain draining Ukraine for a long time, but also, of course, war does tend to cause people to migrate out. And so, when it comes time for Ukraine to rebuild as a peaceful country, is it going to have the talent base even that it had five years ago, is a very big and important question. By the way, Russia, we have brain drained a lot of really smart people out of Russia, a lot of them are here, over the last 30 years. And so, there's this thing, it's actually really funny if you think about it, the one thing that we know to be the height of absolute evil that the West ever did was colonization and resource extraction. So, we know the height of absolute evil was when the Portuguese and the English and everybody else went and had these colonies, and then went in and we took all the oil, and we took all the diamonds, or we took all the whatever, lithium or whatever it is. Well, for some reason we realized that that's a deeply evil thing to do when it's a physical resource, when it's a non-conscious physical matter, for some reason we think it's completely morally acceptable to do it with human capital. In fact, we think it's glorious and beautiful and wonderful and the great flowering of peace and harmony and moral justice of our time to do it, and we don't think for one second what we're doing to the countries that we're pulling all these people out of. And this is one of these things, I don't know, maybe we're just going to live in this delusional state forever, and we'll just keep doing it, and it'll keep benefiting us, and we just won't care what happens, but I think there may come... This is one of these submarines 10 feet under the water line, I think it's just a matter of time until people suddenly realize, oh my God, what are we doing? We need the rest of the world to succeed too, we need these other countries to flourish. We don't want to be the only successful country in the middle of just complete chaos and disaster, and we just extract and we extract and we extract, and we don't think twice about it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is so deeply profound, actually. So, what is the cost of \"winning\" if these countries are drained in terms of human capital, on the level of geopolitics, what does that lead to? Even if we talk about wars and conflict and all of this, we actually want them to be strong, in the way we understand strong, not just in every way, so that cooperation and competition can build a better world for all of humanity. It's interesting, this is one of those truths where you just speak and it resonates, and I didn't even think about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, you were sitting during the holiday season, just boiling over. So, all that said, there's still to use some good to the H-1B?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so then you get this other... Okay, so then there's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Come all the way around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... there's another nuance. So there's another nuance, there's another nuance, which is mostly in the valley we don't use H-1Bs anymore, mostly we use O1s. So, there's a separate class of these, and the O1 is like this... It turns out the O1 is the super genius visa. So, the O1 is basically our founder... When we have somebody from anywhere in the world, and they've invented a breakthrough new technology, and they want to come to the US to start a company, they come in through an O1 Visa. And that actually, it's a fairly high bar, it's a high acceptance rate, but it's a pretty high bar, and they do a lot of work, and you have to put real work into it, really prove your case. Mostly what's happened with the H-1B Visa program is that it has gone to basically two categories of employers. One is basically a small set of big tech companies that hire in volume, which is exactly the companies that you would think, and then the other is it goes to these, what they call the mills, the consulting mills. And so, there's these set of companies with names, I don't want to pick on companies, but names like Cognizant, that hire, basically have their business model is bringing in primarily Indians in large numbers, and they often have offices next to company-owned housing, and they'll have organizations that are literally thousands of Indians living and working in the US, and they do basically call it mid-tier IT consulting. So, these folks, they're making good wages, but they're making 60 or 80 a or 100,000 a year, not the 300,000 that you'd make in the Valley. And so, in practice, the startups, basically little tech as we call it, or the startup world, mainly doesn't use H-1Bs at this point, and mainly can't, because the system is kind of rigged in a way that we really can't. And then, again, you get to the underlying morality here, which is, it's like, well, Amazon, Amazon's... I love Amazon. But they're a big powerful company, they've got more money than God, they've got resources, they've got long-term planning horizon, they do big profound things over decades at a time, they could, or any of these other companies, could launch massively effective programs to go recruit the best and brightest from all throughout the country. And you'll notice they don't do that, they bring in 10,000, 20,000 H1Bs a year. And so, you've got a question there, and then these mills, there's lots of questions around them, and whether that's even an ethical way... I don't want to say they're unethical, but there's questions around exactly what the trade-offs are there. And this like is a Pandora's box that really nobody really wanted to be opened. To play devil's advocate in all this, in terms of national immigration issues, none of this is a top end issue, just because the numbers are small, and so I don't think, the administration has said this is not a priority of theirs for right now. But I guess what I would say is, there is actually a lot of complexity and nuance here. Like I said, I have a lot of friends and colleagues who came over on H-1Bs or O-1s, green cards, many are now citizens, and every single one of them was... Not every single one. A lot of them were enthusiastic to defend the honor of immigrants throughout this whole period. And they said to me, it's like, well, Marc, how can we more clearly express the importance of high school immigration to the US? And I was like, I think you can do it by advocating for also developing our native-born talent. Do you want to inflame the issue or do you want to diffuse the issue? I think the answer is to diffuse the issue. Let me give you one more positive scenario, and then I'll also beat up on the university some more. Do you know about the National Merit Scholarship System, have you heard about this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not really, can you explain?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, there's a system that was created during the Cold War called the National Merit Scholars, and it is a, basically, it was created, I forget, in the 50s or 60s when... It was people in government actually wanted to identify the best and the brightest, as heretical an idea as that sounds today. And so, it's basically a national talent search for, basically, IQ. Its goal is to identify basically the top 0.5% of the IQ in the country. By the way, completely regardless of other characteristics. So, there's no race, gender, or any other aspect to it, it's just going for straight intelligence. It uses, first, the PSAT, which is the preparatory SAT that you take, and then the SAT. So, it uses those scores, that is the scoring, it's a straight PSAT/SAT scoring system. They use the SAT as a proxy for IQ, which it is. They run this every year, they identify, they get down to 1% of the population of the kids, of 18 year olds in an given year, who score highest on the PSAT, and then they further qualify down to the 0.5% that also replicate on the SAT. And then it's like, the scholarship amount is like $2,500. So, it was a lot of money 50 years ago, not as much today. But it's a national system being run, literally, to find the best and the brightest. How many of our great and powerful universities use this as a scouting system? Our universities all have sports teams, they all have national scouting, they have full-time scouts who go out and they go to every high school and they try to find all the great basketball players and bring them into the NCAA, into all these leagues. How many of our great and powerful and enlightened universities use the National Merit System to go do a talent search for the smartest kids and just bring them in?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let me guess, very few. Zero.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Zero. As you say it, that's brilliant, there should be that same level of scouting for talent internally.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>incredibly striking, and an enormous moral indictment of the current system that there are no universities that do this today. So, back to the immigration thing, just real quick, it's like, okay, we aren't even trying to go get the smart kids out of [inaudible 03:03:39], and even if they think that they can get into these places, they get turned down. And the same thing for the smart Asians, and the same thing for the smart Jews, and the same thing for the smart Black people. And I don't know how that's moral, I don't get it at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As you said about the 800, so I took the SAT and the ACT many times, and I've always gotten perfect on math, 800. And I'm not special, it doesn't identify genius, I think you want to search for genius. And you want to create measures that find genius of all different kinds, speaking of diversity. And I guess we should reiterate and say over and over and over, defend immigrants, yes, but say we should hire more and more native-born.<|eot_id|>"}

In fact, we don't have to have a war.<|eot_id|>"}

It feels like 2025 is a good year to build. So, I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe for advice for anybody who's trying to build, who is trying to build something useful in the world. Maybe launch a startup, or maybe just launch apps, services, whatever, ship software products. So, maybe, by way of advice, how do you actually get to shipping?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be phenomenally good. And it's already great. And anybody who wants to see this, just go on YouTube and look at AI coding demos, little kids making apps in 10 minutes, working with an AI coding system. And so, I think it's the golden age... I think this is an area where it's clearly the golden age. The tool set is extraordinary. In a day as a coder, for sure, in a day you can retrain yourself, start using these things, get a huge boost in productivity, as a non-coder, you can learn much more quickly than you could before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's actually a tricky one in terms of learning as a non-coder to build stuff, I feel like you still need to learn how to code.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>figured out massive performance increases, productivity increases with it already, there's other people who aren't even aware it's happening.

The blacksmiths were not necessarily in favor of the car business. So, there's the old William Gibson quote, \"The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet,\" and this is maybe the most potent version of that that I've ever seen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's the old meme with the bell curve, the people on both extremes say, \"AI coding is the future.\" It's very common, the programmers to say, if you're any good of a programmer, you're not going to be using it, that's just not true.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>big deal in those days, and there was a famous book called The Decline and Fall of the American Programmer, that predicted that these new coding systems were going to mean we wouldn't have programmers in the future, and of course, the number of programming jobs exploded by a factor of 100. My guess is we'll have more coding jobs probably by an order of magnitude 10 years from now. That will be different, they'll be different jobs, they'll involve orchestrating AI, but we will be creating so much more software that the whole industry will just explode in size.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you seeing the size of companies decrease in terms of startups?

Now, having said that, I am looking forward to the day, I am waiting for the first company to walk in saying, yes... The more radical form of it. So, basically, the companies that we see are basically one of two kinds, we see the companies that are basically... Sometimes we use weak form, strong form. So, the weak form companies, I sometimes use the term, it's call it the sixth bullet point, AI is the sixth bullet point on whatever they're doing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}

Okay, so we see those, and that's fine, that's like, I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. But then, we see the strong form, which is the companies that are building from scratch for AI, and they're building it... I actually just met with a company that is building literally an AI email system, as an example, so just-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, nice, I can't wait.<|eot_id|>"}

AI is the first bullet point, it's the strong form of the argument.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Cursor is an example of that, they basically said, okay, we're going to rebuild the thing with AI as the first citizen.<|eot_id|>"}

Because momentum, because it's hard to re-engineer the entirety of the system, because feels like Google is perfectly positioned to do it. Same with you have Perplexity, which I love, Google could technically take on Perplexity and do it much better, but they haven't, not yet.

But they're optimizing machines, they're optimizing against the existing business. And as you just said, this is a permanent state of affairs for large organizations.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>AI agents, and imagine a world of billions or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. And crypto, in our view, happens to be the ideal economic system for that, because it's a programmable money. It's a very easy way to plug in and do that. And there's this transaction processing system that can do that. And so I think the crypto AI intersection is potentially a very, very big deal. And so that was going to be impossible under the prior regime, and I think under the new regime, hopefully, it'll be something we can do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Almost for fun. Let me ask a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite things about Yann LeCun? I think he's a brilliant guy. I think he's important to the world. I think you guys disagree on a lot of things, but I personally like vigorous disagreement, I, as a person in the stands, like to watch the gladiators go at it. And-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but to the extent I can understand Yann's points, I can use them to really surface a lot of the questions for the people who are more bullish. And that's been, I think, very, very productive. So it is very striking that you have somebody who is that central in the space, who is actually a full-on skeptic. And again, this could go different ways. He could end up being very wrong. He could end up being totally right, or it could be that he will provoke the evolution of these systems to be much better than they would've been.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He could be both right and wrong. First of all, I do agree with that. He's one of the most legit and rigorous and deep critics of the LLM path to AGI know. His basic notion is that there AI needs to have some physical understanding of the physical world, and that's very difficult to achieve with LLMs. And that is a really good way to challenge the limitations of LLMs and so on. He's also been a vocal and a huge proponent of open source, which is a whole nother, which you have been as well.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Which is very useful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's been just fascinating to watch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And anti-doomer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Anti-doomer?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's very anti-doomer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He embodies ... he also has many wolves inside.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he does. So it's been really, really fun to watch. The other two. Okay, here's my other wolf coming out. The other two of the three godfathers of AI are radicals. Full-on far left, I would say either Marxists or borderline Marxists. And they're, I think, quite extreme in their social political views. And I think that feeds into their doomerism, and I think they are lobbying for draconian government. I think what would be ruinously destructive government legislation and regulation. And so it's actually super helpful, super, super helpful to have you on as a counterpoint to those two.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another fun question, our mutual friend Andrew Huberman. First maybe, what do you love most about Andrew? And second, what score on a scale of one to 10 do you think he would give you on your approach to health?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, three.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Physical three. You think you'd score that high, huh? Okay.<|eot_id|>"}

Having a glass of scotch at night, it was the thing I would do to relax. And so he has profoundly negatively impacted my emotional health. I blame him for making me much less happy as a person, but much, much, much healthier, physically healthier. So that I credit him with that. I'm glad I did that. But then his sleep stuff like, yeah, I'm not doing any of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It must be a metaphor for something.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it's a test. Look, it's a test of manhood as to whether you can have a blue screen in your face for three hours and then go right to sleep. I don't understand why you shouldn't want to take shortcuts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I now understand what they mean by toxic masculinity. All right. So let's see. You're exceptionally successful by most measures, but what to you is the definition of success?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the first ice cream cone makes you super happy. The first mile of the walk in the park during sunset makes super happy. The first kiss makes you super happy. The thousandth ice cream cone, not so much. The thousandth mile of the walk through the park. The thousandth kiss can still be good, but maybe just not right in a row. And so happiness is this very fleeting concept, and the people who anchor on happiness seem to go off the rails pretty often. So the deep sense of having been, I don't know how to put it, useful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's a good place to arrive at in life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>way are pretty centered and generally seem very, I don't know how to put it, pleased, proud, calm, at peace. The people who are sensation seekers ... Some of the sensations, ... By the way, there's certain entrepreneurs, for example, who are into every form of extreme sport and they get huge satisfaction out to that, or they're sensation seeking in useful and productive ways. Larry Ellison was always like that. Zuckerberg is like that. And then there's a lot of entrepreneurs who end up, drugs, like sexual escapades that seem like they'll be fun at first and then backfire.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But at the end of the day, if you're able to be at peace by yourself in a room at 4:00 AM and I would even say happy, but I know, I understand Thomas Jefferson didn't mean it the way, maybe I mean it, but I can be happy by myself at 4:00 AM with a blue screen.<|eot_id|>"}

She has a podcast called, Honestly, with Bari Weiss. She's great. People should go listen. You were asked if you believe in God. One of the joys ... See, we talked about happiness.

Many of the questions today were designed for that. You were asked if you believe in God, and you said after a pause, that you're not sure.

And then, I don't know, maybe God's the last 30 years or something. And then look, I mean just like Elon, it's just like, okay, the known universe is very complicated and mystifying. I mean, every time I pull up an astronomy, my kid super in astronomy, and it's like, Daddy, how many galaxies are there in the universe? And how many galaxies are there in the universe?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A hundred billion?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>most dangerous religion you could ever come up with, is the one where there's no forgiveness.

I mentioned earlier we somehow rediscover the religions of the Indo-Europeans. We're all into identity politics and environmentalism. I don't think that's an accident. So anyway, there is something very deep going on in the human psyche, on religion, that is not dismissible and needs to be taken seriously. Even if one struggles with the specifics of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think I speak for a lot of people that it has been a real joy and, for me, an honor to get to watch you seek to understand the human psyche as you described.
