We love you now, but don't you...\" They would, like that. So I called John Stewart, I was like, \"I don't know what to do.\" And he said the most interesting thing ever. And say, \"If you're afraid of something, make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Bassem Youssef, a legendary Egyptian-American comedian, the so-called John Stewart of the Middle East, who fearlessly satirized those in power even when his job and life were on the line. Bassem is a beautiful human being. It was truly a pleasure for me to get to know him and to have this fun, fascinating, and challenging conversation. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Bassem Youssef.

They understand the separation, but that kind of a grouping of blackmailing people and saying, and not saying what they have in their mind, it is that one of the things that kind of pushed me to go on the show.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The thing that was bothering you, was that what was being said or how it was being said?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Both. Because there are lies, which is usually in the media, but there was the total disregard of humanity.

What's the exchange rate today?\" Of course, it's terrible to see anybody die, but I feel that like, isn't our life not worth anything?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

What do you do? He can't even keep a job.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to us because I have to believe. It's also one of the things, like how it was said, it was stuff that I've been hearing. I don't know what turned on in my head, but it's stuff that I've been hearing all my life from the media, \"Israel warns civilians before bombing them, and that's okay,\" but that's not okay. Israel is trying to minimize the civilians, but killing them anyway. And that's okay, but that's not okay. So it is kind of like the indoctrination that we've been hearing, as if it is okay, and then suddenly it's not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a kind of several layers of bullshit, almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff. Just the basic value of human life. That said, it's a difficult situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What would you do if you were Israel?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, I'll definitely hear him out. That was like, \"Wait a minute. That's material.

Just like, I'm on my phone, and it was like, \"Oh, Netanyahu.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it just shows up that way. I mean, what would you do? What would you do in this situation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them is that, they don't really care about... That's why that the exchange rate thing. So for me, if I am Israel, it'll be like, \"What would you do if you're the United States in the time of the Native Americans? They were killing people with the millions.\" When you dehumanize a group of people, you really don't care. So if I was Israel, I would do exactly what Israel is doing right now, because there's no one is holding me accountable. There is no one stopping me, and I can get whatever I want, throughout my history, through violence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think a lot of the things you just said are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated. So let me try.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Please, please.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's try. So not everybody in Israel.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's look at several groups. So people in government, IDF soldiers and citizens that are neither of those. And not everybody of any of those sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage. So what percentage is that in your sense?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the people who have the power.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's mostly the focus of your commentary, when you say, \"People in Israel,\" you really mean the people in power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>go in, and they demonstrate against Netanyahu and they want him out of the government. But we have to admit that the Israeli society at a whole have moved quite bit to the right and has been many extreme. And you know what happens when you go to the right or you go to the most extreme, the other person go to the most extreme, and extremism breeds extremism. So thank you for the clarification, but I really meant, with the people of power. When people criticize the United States for going in Iraq, of course I'm not criticizing citizens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you made another point, which is an interesting point and it's very difficult to see in the heart of people. But I wonder if you look at the average Palestinian and the average Israeli, and when they look at the other, do they have some hate in their heart? Well, everybody probably has some. What is that amount? When you look at a person that looks different than you, how much hate is there?<|eot_id|>"}

February 11th, Mohammed Khattour, US citizens killed while being in a parked car.

This is a daily life of people in the West Bank.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is the justification the IDF provides?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Terrorism.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Terrorism?<|eot_id|>"}

So what happened, what Israel is doing, it is removing itself, like America too, drones [inaudible 00:19:55]. And then when you push someone to be, they always brag about bombing them to the Stone Ages. What happens when the screens, and all of the obstacles that you have been put between you and those people, that you have treated them this way, when this is a breach and you come face to face, you will come face to face with what you have created.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a lot of interesting things you just said. So one is the methodology of killing. If you want to look at some horrific, hard-scaled killing, people often talk about the Holocaust, but that's visceral. You can look at Holodomor by Stalin, where the murders through starvation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By Churchill in India.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Churchill, in India, and the Great Leap Forward by Mao. So starvation is a thing we don't often think of it as murder because it's quiet, it's slow. And the interesting thing about starvation is that the people don't complain as they're dying because they're exhausted. That's one. And the other is the value of human life, it does seem that every culture has an unequal valuation of human life. So those two things combined create a complicated military landscape of the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's like a lot of fish in the sea. Same with AI. Boom, 500 people killed. Boom, get killed. It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy. And then it's so far removed from you. So when you put these people in this condition, you have literally put them in a different universe than yours. You are behind in your air conditioned screens, pushing them, blowing up a university. It's amazing. But then you meet what you have done, you meet the Frankenstein that you have created, and then people are like, \"Oh, look what they did to us.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You just gave me this image of a dating app from hell.

And then, turn off the phone and go to sleep. So I traveled to the West Bank and I mentioned to you offline that I really loved the people there. I've met a bunch of people like that in Eastern Europe where I grew up. Yeah, like the flamboyant, the big personalities, all of that. I also met a person who's in charge of a refugee camp who was shot by an IDF soldier. And I'm not sure the words he said are important as the consequences of the thing that you mentioned, which is the deep hate in his eyes. That didn't feel repairable at all. It was pain, it was like a foundation of pain, and on top of that, a hatred. And I was like, \"Wow, you kill one person. This is what you create.\"<|eot_id|>"}

They throw little things at you so you don't know what to do. Or the honor war, \"The UNN,\" \"Anti-Semitic.\" \"October 7th,\" \"October 7th,\" \"October 7th,\" and then suddenly you are distracted and pulled into discussing all of these little things and you're not discussing what's happening right now. It is basically stalling, giving them time to do what they do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's some degree to the propaganda though. So the beheaded babies and all this kind of stuff that is so over the top that it shuts down actual conversation about actual wrongs, war crimes on both sides. So it's overstating it to where everyone on social media and everywhere in the press and everywhere is arguing, almost become desensitized to actual horrors of death, which are more mundane. They're not so dramatic as beheaded babies.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, because may be shot, but decapitated babies, there's like a knife blade that goes into the skin, the trachea, the flesh, the spine.

And that's why you-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have made me laugh at the darkest shit. You're such a beautiful person. Your dark humor is just wonderful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you see this happened to Jews before. Remember blood libel? Where did the blood libel come from?

But in constantly asking about sources of hope or solutions, there was none. There was a really dark sense of, it's hopeless, from both sides. It's hopeless. So I look to you for a source hope. For a source of hope. Is there any hope here? Solutions? Short term, long term?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Listen, what happened was there was a lot of catches on the Oslo Accord. It was very unfair to the Palestinians.

And then Ehud Barak left because there was election and he lost the Ariel Sharon game and it was destroyed. This is one of the reason why people... It's kind of like facts don't matter as much as what is the narrative that has been controlled.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But what were the biggest barriers to peace there?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if I have that much military, I can do whatever I want, why would I give up anything? I have that much power.

So it is really about what can push Israel to give up something? Because you are so much stronger than me, what could compel you to give up something? And this is why the whole thing about trying to equalize Palestinians and the Israeli state and government, it doesn't make any sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the source of hope?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Well, everybody's talking about the two-state solution, but Israel has said many times, or Netanyahu and [inaudible 00:32:15], \"There's going to be no state solutions.\" In the past, it's like even Naftali Bennett, he came in on [inaudible 00:32:23] like, \"Yeah, maybe in the past we wanted two-state solutions, but look, every time we give them land, they kill us.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The rhetoric that is supported by action. Because look at what they're doing in the West Bank, as you said.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a nice little picture of what's happening.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>little, little by little. And we would shout every time when it gets too much and then we'll shut down, and then little by little. But this time it was hard. It was hard to see the blatant oppression. And the world said, \"Maybe the Hamas Ministry of Health are giving us the bad numbers. Maybe these are human shields.\" And I laughed. There's 13,000 babies killed. Does that mean that there are 13,000 military target hiding in their diapers? Because it doesn't make any sense to kill that many babies it's just like, \"Oops, it's out of our hands.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's hard to know what to do with those numbers.

We never hear a story about the Palestinian kid. That's why thank you for giving me the space for saying the names of the Palestinian children that were killed just in four weeks. Because humans needs context. They need depth. They need a 3D look at what they can look at. But if you just tell numbers, \"Oh.\" They don't mean anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some degree to where both leaderships, Hamas, PA, Palestinian Authority, Israel, all want war, like perpetual war to remain in power?<|eot_id|>"}

They're not equal in power, they're not equal in influence, and they're not equal in international support, especially with the United States.

What can they change?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, is that true though, with how much support the Palestinian people have? So just like you said, there's a lot of Arab states that will voice their pro-Palestinian position in order to distract from their own corruption and abuses of power in their own countries.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what that entails. But those are Hamas, again, not defending them. They went into October 7th.

I didn't know what he was saying, I didn't understand what is Democrats, what is Republicans? Those names that he's saying... What is Fox News? I don't understand. But I was fascinated. There was something... You know when you don't understand the music, but you get the rhythm? It was that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder what that is that you saw.

And over the next two, three years, I had 30 to 40 million people watch. 30 to 40 million people watching every episode.

And some of them were taking pictures of me. And then I'm sitting there, and it was the most ridiculous interview ever because he was asking me about my jokes.

It's like, \"You made fun of us, so now it made it easier for people to kill us.\" Like, \"Dude, come on. You're doing that to me too. I just did it better than you.

It's like if this was an English show and I was telling you fuck and shit and bitch, you'll be, \"Ha, ha, ha, ha...\" But if I do one swear word, all of you will cringe.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Is it because we are ashamed of our own... So it's not just about swearing, it's about... There's a lot of philosophical pathways in this. Yeah, there's profanity and people have fun, whatever. But it is about how do we treat our language? And I tell them, \"We speak Arabic as Arabs, but it's not the same Arabic.\" It's crazy, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're doing the show in America also, which is another level of [inaudible 01:48:58].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah. Actually the Arab diaspora in America is some of the best audiences I have. They are wonderful.

It's just I'm different.\" And the places are different and the people are different and their circumstances are different. Whatever image you had you have of what you love is not there anymore. That's why a lot of immigrants, especially Arab immigrants, they live here, but they're there. And then when they go back for a vacation, they get disappointed because they didn't find what they want. And then they come back here and they're disappointed because they want to come back, but it's not there anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Their view of that place is from a different time. I have that... My parents, but everybody that left the Soviet Union, I mean it's such a complicated relationship with that. It's sometimes borders on hate, disappointment. In the case of the Soviet Union, perhaps similar to Egypt is the promise is sold when you were younger and the promise is broken by the possibility of what it was supposed to be. With the Soviet Union, I'm sure with Egypt it's the same. Iran is the same. So they have a very complicated relationship with that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

And there were people in the audience all wearing Iranian shirts. They hate the regime, but they have this kind of connection with the country. And this is the whole thing.

You could be a comedian.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Wow. You're making me feel good. Okay. Sam Harris has done several episodes on Jihad and people should go listen to it, even if you disagree with it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I totally agree. But people don't wake up in the morning and say like, \"I want to declare Jihad.\" Think about it.

One of the first suicide bombers in the Palestinian resistance were Christians.

They're dying by themselves.\" So the nitpicking of a certain narrative, religious narrative that is separate from the political context and what's happening right now, it's very unfair, because I can read... If you want to have a deep dive into religious texts, nobody will be happy. And I can bring stuff from the Talmud and the Torah and stuff that is horrible.
