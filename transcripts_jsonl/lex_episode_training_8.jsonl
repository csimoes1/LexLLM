{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it's very frightening. It's very frightening.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, the company that created Claude, that is currently and often at the top of most LLM benchmark leader boards. On top of that, Dario and the Anthropic team have been outspoken advocates for taking the topic of AI safety very seriously. And they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating AI on this and other topics. I'm also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from Anthropic. First Amanda Askell, who is a researcher working on alignment and fine-tuning of Claude, including the design of Claude's character and personality. A few folks told me she has probably talked with Claude more than any human at Anthropic. So she was definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering and practical advice on how to get the best out of Claude. After that, Chris Olah stopped by for a chat. He's one of the pioneers of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is an exciting set of efforts that aims to reverse engineering neural networks, to figure out what's going on inside, inferring behaviors from neural activation patterns inside the network. This is a very promising approach for keeping future super-intelligent AI systems safe. For example, by detecting from the activations when the model is trying to deceive the human it is talking to. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Dario Amodei. Let's start with a big idea of scaling laws and the scaling hypothesis. What is it? What is its history, and where do we stand today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that probably the scaling is going to continue, and that there's some magic to it that we haven't really explained on a theoretical basis yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course the scaling here is bigger networks, bigger data, bigger compute?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of those?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>others, you run out of the other reagents and the reaction stops. But if you scale up everything in series, then the reaction can proceed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course now that you have this kind of empirical science/art, you can apply it to other more nuanced things like scaling laws applied to interpretability or scaling laws applied to post-training. Or just seeing how does this thing scale. But the big scaling law, I guess the underlying scaling hypothesis has to do with big networks, big data leads to intelligence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>post-training or there are new types of reasoning models. And in all of those cases that we've measured, we see similar types of scaling laws.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A bit of a philosophical question, but what's your intuition about why bigger is better in terms of network size and data size? Why does it lead to more intelligent models?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so the guess, and this is pure speculation, would be that there's some kind of long tail distribution of the distribution of these ideas.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's the long tail, but also there's the height of the hierarchy of concepts that you're building up. So the bigger the network, presumably you have a higher capacity to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's not good at the paragraphs. And so these rarer and more complex patterns get picked up as I add more capacity to the network.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, the natural question then is what's the ceiling of this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How complicated and complex is the real world? How much is the stuff is there to learn?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think we'll only find out when we build these systems. It's very hard to know in advance. We can speculate, but we can't be sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And in some domains, the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracies and things like this, as you write about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So humans fundamentally has to be part of the loop. That's the cause of the ceiling, not maybe the limits of the intelligence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>balance. I strongly suspect that balance is kind of more on the side of wishing to make things happen faster, but there is a balance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we do hit a limit, if we do hit a slowdown in the scaling laws, what do you think would be the reason? Is it compute-limited, data-limited? Is it something else? Idea limited?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>need to unblock things. I've seen no evidence of that so far, but if things were to slow down, that perhaps could be one reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the limits of compute, meaning the expensive nature of building bigger and bigger data centers?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've pointed to a lot of possible reasons why that might not happen. But if the extrapolation curve continues, that is the trajectory we're on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Anthropic has several competitors. It'd be interesting to get your sort of view of it all. OpenAI, Google, XAI, Meta. What does it take to win in the broad sense of win in this space?<|eot_id|>"}

It's about shaping the incentives to point upward instead of shaping the incentives to point downward.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we should say this example of the field of mechanistic interpretability is just a rigorous non-hand wavy wave doing AI safety-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interventions on the model, where you kind of adjust its behavior, somehow emotionally made it seem more human than any other version of the model.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a strong personality, strong identity.<|eot_id|>"}

In March. Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku were released. Then Claude 3.5 Sonnet in July, with an updated version just now released. And then also Claude 3.5 Haiku was released. Okay.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's very much an inexact science. In many ways, the manner and personality of these models is more an art than it is a science.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the reason for the span of time between say, Claude Opus 3.0 and 3.5? What takes that time, if you can speak to it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but you want to make the process streamlined. And I think the creative tension between those is an important thing in making the models work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, rumor on the street, I forget who was saying that, Anthropic has really good tooling. So probably a lot of the challenge here is, on the software engineering side, is to build the tooling to have a efficient, low-friction interaction with the infrastructure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>other companies.

There's been leaps in performance.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the relay race better. And it's just natural that when we make a new model, we put all of these things in at once.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the data you have, the preference data you get from RLHF, is there ways to apply it to newer models as it get trained up?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are used every day. So it's not just RLHF, a bunch of other methods as well. Post-training, I think, is becoming more and more sophisticated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, what explains the big leap in performance for the new Sonnet 3.5, I mean, at least in the programming side? And maybe this is a good place to talk about benchmarks. What does it mean to get better? Just the number went up, but I program, but I also love programming, and I Claude 3.5 through Cursor is what I use to assist me in programming.

Why not Sonnet 3.6, which a lot of people are calling it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the companies have struggled with this. I think we were in a good position in terms of naming when we had Haiku, Sonnet and Opus.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was great, great start.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>been perfect at it. It's something we struggle with surprisingly much relative to how trivial it is for the grand science of training the models.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So from the user side, the user experience of the updated Sonnet 3.5 is just different than the previous June 2024 Sonnet 3.5. It would be nice to come up with some kind of labeling that embodies that. Because people talk about Sonnet 3.5, but now there's a different one.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are the personality properties we want models to have and which we don't want to have.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>From Reddit? Oh, boy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just this fascinating, to me at least, it's a psychological social phenomenon where people report that Claude has gotten dumber for them over time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>another effect, but that's all a very long-winded way of saying for the most part, with some fairly narrow exceptions, the models are not changing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there is a psychological effect. You just start getting used to it, the baseline raises. When people who have first gotten Wi-Fi on airplanes, it's amazing, magic.<|eot_id|>"}

So it's easy to have the conspiracy theory of, \"They're making Wi-Fi slower and slower.\" This is probably something I'll talk to Amanda much more about, but another Reddit question, \"When will Claude stop trying to be my pure tentacle grandmother imposing its moral worldview on me as a paying customer?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>anywhere. So once you have the pre-trained model, you have all the representations you need to get the model where you want it to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So do you think RLHF makes the model smarter, or just appear smarter to the humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with human feedback. But, the kind of RLHF we do today mostly doesn't do that yet, although we're very quickly starting to be able to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But if you look at the metric of helpfulness, it increases that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think RLHF unhobbles the models in some ways.

Or is post-training creep up to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>cost.

Might Anthropic release a model spec as well?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>from them. So again, I think this is an example of the positive dynamic that I think we should all want the field to have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's talk about the incredible essay Machines of Loving Grace. I recommend everybody read it. It's a long one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is rather long.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

And you took a bold stance because it's very possible that you might be wrong on the dates or the specific applications-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>details. I might be just spectacularly wrong about the whole thing and people will laugh at me for years. That's just how the future works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you provided a bunch of concrete positive impacts of AI and how exactly a super intelligent AI might accelerate the rate of breakthroughs in, for example, biology and chemistry, that would then lead to things like we cure most cancers, prevent all infectious disease, double the human lifespan and so on. So let's talk about this essay first. Can you give a high-level vision of this essay? And what are the key takeaways that people have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the benefits and you really want humanity or civilization to seize those benefits. But, you also get very serious about anything that could derail them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I think the starting point is to talk about what this Powerful AI, which is the term you like to use, most of the world uses AGI, but you don't like the term, because it's basically has too much baggage, it's become meaningless. It's like we're stuck with the terms whether we like them or not.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe we're stuck with the terms and my efforts to change them are futile.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's admirable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'll tell you what else I don't ... This is a pointless semantic point, but I keep talking about it-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's back to naming again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in AGI. But, if AGI is some discrete or separate thing, which is the way people often talk about it, then it's a meaningless buzzword.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To me, it's just a platonic form of a powerful AI, exactly how you define it. You define it very nicely, so on the intelligence axis, it's just on pure intelligence, it's smarter than a Nobel Prize winner as you describe across most relevant disciplines. So okay, that's just intelligence. So it's both in creativity and be able to generate new ideas, all that kind of stuff in every discipline, Nobel Prize winner in their prime. It can use every modality, so this is self-explanatory, but just operate across all the modalities of the world. It can go off for many hours, days and weeks to do tasks and do its own detailed planning and only ask you help when it's needed. This is actually interesting. I think in the essay you said ... Again, it's a bet that it's not going to be embodied, but it can control embodied tools. So it can control tools, robots, laboratory equipment., the resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run millions of copies of it, and each of those copies would be independent that could do their own independent work. So you can do the cloning of the intelligence systems.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Oh, we'll have one and it'll take a while to make them,\" my point there was, no. Actually you have millions of them right away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And in general they can learn and act 10 to 100 times faster than humans. So that's a really nice definition of powerful AI. Okay, so that. But, you also write that, \"Clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problems very fast, but it is not trivial to figure out how fast. Two \"extreme\" positions both seem false to me.\" So the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite and the other extreme. Can you describe each of the extremes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So why?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>complex enough that just iterating, just running the experiment is going to beat any modeling, no matter how smart the system doing the modeling is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, even if it's not interacting with the physical world, just the modeling is going to be hard?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, the modeling is going to be hard and getting the model to match the physical world is going to be<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right. So it does have to interact with the physical world to verify.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>AI, who can't understand how it could possibly be the case that these things won't change so fast. I think they don't understand these things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what to you is the timeline to where we achieve AGI, A.K.A. powerful AI, A.K.A. super useful AI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm going to start calling it that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a debate about naming. On pure intelligence smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in every relevant discipline and all the things we've said. Modality, can go and do stuff on its own for days, weeks, and do biology experiments on its own in one ... You know what? Let's just stick to biology, because you sold me on the whole biology and health section. And that's so exciting from just ... I was getting giddy from a scientific perspective. It made me want to be a biologist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we fight about all these political questions, is this something that could actually bring us together? But you were asking when will we get this?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When? When do you think? Just putting numbers on the table.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>these clips will crop out the thing I just said and only say the thing I'm about to say. But I'll just say it anyway-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have fun with it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're not laws of the universe. They're empirical regularities.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>simulate at all. AI is not God, but can we shift the curve substantially and radically?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>programming as a role, programming as a job will not change. It'll just be less writing things line by line and it'll be more macroscopic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I wonder what the future of IDEs looks like. So the tooling of interacting with AI systems, this is true for programming and also probably true for in other contexts like computer use, but maybe domain specific, like we mentioned biology, it probably needs its own tooling about how to be effective.

And I think that's the guide to the sorts of traits that I tend to think about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's a beautiful framework. I want you to think about this, a world traveler, and while holding onto your opinions, you don't talk down to people, you don't think you're better than them because you have those opinions, that kind of thing. You have to be good at listening and understanding their perspective, even if it doesn't match your own. So that's a tricky balance to strike. So how can Claude represent multiple perspectives on a thing? Is that challenging? We could talk about politics is a very divisive, but there's other divisive topics on baseball teams, sports and so on. How is it possible to empathize with a different perspective and to be able to communicate clearly about the multiple perspectives?<|eot_id|>"}

But I'm a little bit less inclined to affect how you think because it feels much more important that you maintain autonomy there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you really embody intellectual humility, the desire to speak decreases quickly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. But Claude has to speak, but without being overbearing. But then there's a line when you're discussing whether the earth is flat or something like that. Actually, I remember a long time ago was speaking to a few high profile folks and they were so dismissive of the idea that the earth is flat, so arrogant about it. There's a lot of people that believe the earth is flat. I don't know if that movement is there anymore, that was a meme for a while, but they really believed it. And okay, so I think it's really disrespectful to completely mock them. I think you have to understand where they're coming from. I think probably where they're coming from is the general skepticism of institutions which is grounded in a, there's a deep philosophy there which you could understand, you can even agree with in parts. And then from there you can use it as an opportunity to talk about physics without mocking them, without someone, but it's just like, okay, what would the world look like? What would the physics of the world with the flat earth look like? There's a few cool videos on this. And then is it possible the physics is different? And what kind of experience would we do? And just without disrespect, without dismissiveness, have that conversation. Anyway, that to me is a useful thought experiment of how does Claude talk to a flat earth believer and still teach them something, still grow, help them grow, that kind of stuff. That's challenging.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>reach wherever they reach. And that's a line that is difficult, but that's the kind of thing that language models have to try and do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So like I said, you've had a lot of conversations with Claude. Can you just map out what those conversations are like? What are some memorable conversations? What's the purpose, the goal of those conversations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just aren't, or questions that are just mildly augmented and you have thousands of them might be less relevant than a hundred really well-selected questions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's see, you're talking to somebody who as a hobby does a podcast. I agree with you 100%. If you're able to ask the right questions and are able to hear, understand the depth and the flaws in the answer, you can get a lot of data from that. So your task is basically how to probe with questions. And you're exploring the long tail, the edges, the edge cases, or are you looking for general behavior?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people think is fine, can actually produce things that at least to my mind are probably a little bit more divisive, but I like them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I guess a poem is a nice clean way to observe creativity. It's just easy to detect vanilla versus non-vanilla.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's interesting. That's really interesting. So on that topic, so the way to produce creativity or something special, you mentioned writing prompts. And I've heard you talk about the science and the art of prompt engineering. Could you just speak to what it takes to write great prompts?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>get clear on things myself. So in many ways clear prompting for me is often just me understanding what I want is half the task.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I guess that's quite challenging. There's a laziness that overtakes me if I'm talking to Claude where I hope Claude just figures it out. So for example, I asked Claude for today to ask some interesting questions. And the questions that came up and I think I listed a few interesting counterintuitive or funny or something like this. All right. And it gave me some pretty good, it was okay, but I think what I'm hearing you say is like, all right, well I have to be more rigorous here. I should probably give examples of what I mean by interesting and what I mean by funny or counterintuitive and iteratively build that prompt to better to get what feels like is the right... Because it is really, it's a creative act. I'm not asking for factual information, I'm asking together with Claude. So I almost have to program using natural language.<|eot_id|>"}

You can play around with these things quite a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To jump into technical for a little bit, so the magic of post-training, why do you think RLHF works so well to make the model seem smarter, to make it more interesting and useful to talk to and so on?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot of that feels like it's there in the pre-trained models.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I worked on it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain this idea from your perspective, how does it integrate into making Claude what it is? By the way, do you gender Claude or no?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in this particular case, you're taking lots of things that could make a response preferable and getting models to do the labeling for you, basically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a nice trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>data relatively quickly that should just train the models to have that trait.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's how we nudged the model to have a better shape, which doesn't mean that we actually agree with that wording,\" if that makes sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's system prompts that made public, you tweeted one of the earlier ones for Claude 3, I think, and then they're made public since then. It was interesting to read through them. I can feel the thought that went into each one. And I also wonder how much impact each one has. Some of them you can tell Claude was really not behaving well, so you have to have a system prompt to like, Hey, trivial stuff, I guess, basic informational things. On the topic of controversial topics that you've mentioned, one interesting one I thought is if it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of use held by a significant number of people, Claude provides assistance with a task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information. Claude presents the request information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive and without claiming to be presenting the objective facts. It's less about objective facts according to Claude, and it's more about our large number of people believing this thing. And that's interesting. I mean, I'm sure a lot of thought went into that. Can you just speak to it? How do you address things that are a tension \"Claude's views\"?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what you think is objective. So that was with initial versions of that part, the system prompt, when I was iterating on it was like.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a lot of parts of these sentences-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Are doing work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... are doing some work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's what it felt like. That's fascinating. Can you explain maybe some ways in which the prompts evolved over the past few months? Different versions. I saw that the filler phrase request was removed, the filler it reads, Claude responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations to filler phrases. Certainly, of course, absolutely, great, sure. Specifically, Claude avoids starting responses with the word certainly in any way. That seems like good guidance, but why was it removed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the system prompt. So I think that's just something where we're like, Claude does affirmations a bit less, and so it wasn't doing as much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I see. So the system prompt works hand in hand with the post-training and maybe even the pre-training to adjust the final overall system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>behaviors to make it better and more to people's preferences. So yeah, it's almost like the less robust but faster way of just solving problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about the feeling of intelligence. So Dario said that any one model of Claude is not getting dumber, but- Any one model of Claude is not getting dumber, but there is a popular thing online where people have this feeling Claude might be getting dumber.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>internet. And it was really interesting, because I knew that... At least in the cases I was looking at, I was like, nothing has changed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with a few prompts or something, and it looked like it was getting much worse and actually it was just...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All the times that Claude says something really smart, your sense of its intelligent grows in your mind, I think.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then if you return back and you prompt in a similar way, not the same way, in a similar way, concept it was okay with before, and it says something dumb, that negative experience really stands out.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tried it, it would've only succeeded half of the time, and now it only succeeds half of the time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I just feel like it's the opposite. Things move fast and you have a lot of responsibility and I quite enjoy it for some reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It really is a huge amount of impact, if you think about constitutional AI and writing a system prompt for something that's tending towards super intelligence and potentially is extremely useful to a very large number of people.<|eot_id|>"}

But I don't know, ethically, philosophically don't know what to really do with that. There potentially could be laws that prevent AI systems from claiming to be conscious, something like this, and maybe some AIs get to be conscious and some don't.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how it works.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not the simplest way, or the most economical way, or something like this.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. So, maybe I'll start by just describing some phenomena, and then we can build to the idea of features and circuits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wonderful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be, these idealized neurons. The things that are the nice neurons, but also maybe there's more of them somehow hidden.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in some ways, the core thing. It's like we can talk about this outside the context of neurons. Are you familiar with the Word2Vec results?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm- hmm.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to a vector. I mean, that in itself, by the way, is kind of a crazy thing if you haven't thought about it before, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>add things together, that you can independently modify, say gender and royalty, or cuisine type, or country, and the concept of food by adding them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think the linear hypothesis holds-<|eot_id|>"}

That's kind of how I feel about space travel, like colonizing Mars. There's a lot of people that criticize that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>networks, my guest would be, could do very well in terms of going and packing things to the point that's probably not the limiting factor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How does the problem of polysemanticity enter the picture here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>explains the observation of polysemanticity.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so I think if you want the deepest reason why we want to have interpretable monosomatic features, I think that's really the deep reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so the goal here as your recent work has been aiming at is how do we extract the monosomatic features from a neural net that has polysemantic features and all this mess.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>would necessarily predict, but it turns out that works very, very well. To me, that seems like some non-trivial validation of linear representations and superposition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So with dictionary learning, you're not looking for particular kind of categories. You don't know what they are, they just emerge.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't know what's going to be there.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>might still very well fail, but I think that some very significant amount of research risk was put behind us when that started to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you describe what kind of features can be extracted in this way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you're like the, and then predict vector or matrix, all these mathematical words, whereas in other contexts you would predict other things, that was common.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And basically we need clever humans to assign labels to what we're seeing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tokens than regular. And there's some things about tokenization as well that it can exploit.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on the specific of what's going on. So I think that's a pretty common situation.

That little gap between it is true, but it doesn't quite get to the deep nuance of a thing. That's a general challenge, it's already an incredible caution that can say a true thing, but it's missing the depth sometimes.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>something we can trust?

Yeah, for sure. So it turns out TLDR, it worked.<|eot_id|>"}

They respond to images and texts for the same concept, which is fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Can you explain that? I mean, backdoor, there's just a lot of examples that you can-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some of the top data set examples where things like dash dash, disable SSL or something like this, which are sort of obviously really insecure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So at this point, maybe it's just because the examples are presented that way, it's kind of surface a little bit more obvious examples. I guess the idea is that down the line it might be able to detect more nuance like deception or bugs or that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that, but I was kind of delighted that that was the thing that it came up with as the top image examples for the feature.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's nice. It's multimodal. It's multi almost context. It's broad, strong definition of a singular concept. It's nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To me, one of the really interesting features, especially for AI safety, is deception and lying. And the possibility that these kinds of methods could detect lying in a model, especially get smarter and smarter and smarter. Presumably that's a big threat over super intelligent model that it can deceive the people operating it as to its intentions or any of that kind of stuff. So what have you learned from detecting lying inside models?<|eot_id|>"}

You've written about this as kind of organs question.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we think of interpretability as a kind of anatomy of neural networks, most of the circus threads involve studying tiny little veins looking at the small scale and individual neurons and how they connect. However, there are many natural questions that the small-scale approach doesn't address. In contrast, the most prominent abstractions and biological anatomy involve larger-scale structures like individual organs, like the heart or entire organ systems like the respiratory system. And so we wonder, is there a respiratory system or heart or brain region of an artificial neural network?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>inside neural networks, a lot of very deep beauty if we're just willing to take the time to go and see it and understand it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I love Mechinterp.
