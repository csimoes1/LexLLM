{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's not true.\" The best protection against evil is recognizing that it lies in every human heart and the possibility that it takes you over.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you ever sit back in the quiet of your mind and think, Am I participating in evil? The following is a conversation with Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator, host of the Ben Shapiro show, co-founder of The Daily Wire, and author of several books, including The Authoritarian Moment, The Right Side of History and Facts Don't Care About Your Feelings. Whatever Your political leanings, I humbly asked that you tried to put those aside and listen with an open mind trying to give the most charitable interpretation of the words we say. This is true in general for this podcast, whether the guest is Ben Shapiro or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Donald Trump, or Barack Obama, I will talk to everyone from every side, from the far left to the far right, from presidents to prisoners, from artists to scientists, from the powerful to the powerless, because we are all human, all capable of good and evil, all with fascinating stories and ideas to explore. I seek only to understand, and in so doing, hopefully add a bit of love to the world. This is Lex Fridman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro. Let's start with a difficult topic. What do you think about the comments made by Ye formerly known as Kanye West about Jewish people?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the general, the group, the Jews in general. That's textbook bigotry, and if we're putting any other context, he would probably recognize it as such.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To the degree that's what fuels hate in the world. What's the way to reverse that process? What's the way to alleviate the hate?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the latest opportunity to jump on that particular bandwagon. But listen, I think that people do have a moral duty to call that stuff out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there is a degree to which it normalizes that idea that Jews control the media, Jews control X institution. Is there a way to talk about a high representation of a group like Jewish people in a certain institution like the media or Hollywood and so on without it being a hateful conversation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>when you are attributing a bad characteristic to an entire population based on the notion that some members of that population are doing bad things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a jump between... It's also possible that record label owners as a group have a culture that Fs over artists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Doesn't treat artists fairly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>conspiracy theory about the levers of power being controlled by a shadowy cadre of people who are getting together behind closed doors to control things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The most absurd illustration of antisemitism, just like you said, is Stalin versus Hitler over Poland that every bad guy was a Jew. So every enemy... There's a lot of different enemy groups, intellectuals, political and so on. Military. And behind any movement that is considered the enemy for the Nazis and any movement that's considered the enemy for the Soviet army are the Jews.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no question Communists could have taken power.

And so that person has to be stopped by any means necessary, and that's dangerous stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the communists had to be stopped in Nazi Germany, and so they're the devil. And so any useful buffoon, as long as they're effective against the communists would do.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It actually is a super, super long list. People should check it out. And it's quite honest and raw. It's interesting to ask you, given how pro-life you are about, Ye's, comments about comparing the Holocaust to the 900, 000 abortions in the United States a year.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>then you do think that what's happening is a great tragedy on scale that involves the dehumanization of an entire class of people, the pre-born.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the philosophical you understand the comparison.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in his comments, in the jumping from the individual to the group, I'd like to ask you... You're one of the most effective people in the world that are attacking the left, and sometimes it can slip into attacking the group. Do you worry that's the same kind of oversimplification that Ye's, doing about Jewish people that you can sometimes do with the left as a group?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>philosophy is bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that you as a person are bad. But it does mean that I think your philosophy is bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the grouping is based on the philosophy versus something like a race. The color of your skin or race as in the case of the Jewish people. So it's a different thing. You can be a little bit more nonchalant and careless in attacking a group because it's ultimately attacking a set of ideas.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>whether I'm mislabeling, whether I'm taking somebody who's not actually a communist and then shoving them in that group of Communists, that would be inaccurate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The dangerous thing is it expands the group as opposed to you talking about the philosophy you're throwing everybody who's ever said, \"I'm curious about communism. I'm curious about socialism.\" There's like a gradient. It's like to throw something at you, I think Joe Biden said, \"Maga Republicans.\" I think that's a very careless statement because the thing you jump to immediately is all Republicans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>All Republicans voted for Trump.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Vote for Trump versus I think in the charitable interpretation that means a set of ideas.<|eot_id|>"}

I'll try to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also you don't shy away from humor and occasional trolling and mockery and all that kind of stuff for the fun, for chaos, all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>loves Venn diagrams or electric buses. That's funny stuff. So if I can't make fun of that, then my job becomes pretty morose pretty quickly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's funny to figure out what is the perfect balance between seeing the humor and the absurdity of the game of it versus taking it seriously enough because it does affect hundreds of millions of people. It's a weird balance to strike. It's like I am afraid with the internet that everything becomes a joke.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because it would've, just factually speaking. So if I can speak that way about myself, I feel like everybody else can take it as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Difficult question. In 2017, there was a mosque shooting in Quebec City, six people died, five others seriously injured. The 27 year old gunman consumed a lot of content online and checked Twitter accounts a lot, of a lot of people. But one of the people he checked quite a lot of is you 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting. If you could talk to that young man, what would you tell him? And maybe other young men listening to this that have hate in their heart in that same way. What would you tell them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hate. Hate is a form of violence, speech is a form of violence. Speech needs to be curbed. And that to me is deeply disturbing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So definitely that man, that 27 year old man is the only one responsible for the evil he did. But what if he and others like him are not nut cases? What if they're people with pain, with anger in their heart? What would you say to them? You're exceptionally influential and other people like you that speak passionately about ideas. What do you think is your opportunity to alleviate the hate in their heart?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I didn't think that it were worth trying to convince people of my point of view, I wouldn't do what I do for a living.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So violence doesn't solve anything?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>support for Israel is all about the Benjamins, and she's had to be [inaudible 00:29:36] by members of her own party about this stuff before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you empathize with the plight of Palestinian people?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what he's pitching at Twitter, he I think should enact that himself and be a little more careful in the stuff that he tweets out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's a tricky balance. The reason a lot of people are freaking out is because one, he's putting his thumb on the scale by saying he is more likely to vote Republican. He's showing himself to be center-right, and just having a political opinion versus being this amorphous thing that doesn't have a political opinion. I think, I haven't talked to him about it, but if I were to guess, he's sending a kind of signal that's important for Twitter, the company itself, because if we're being honest, most of the employees are left-leaning. So you have to send a signal like a resisting mechanism to say, since most of the employees are left, it's good for Elon to be more right to balance out the way the actual engineering is done to say, \"We're not going to do any kind of act activism inside the engineering.\" If I were to guess, that's the effective aspect of that mechanism. The other one by posting the Pelosi thing is probably to expand the Overton window. Like saying, \"We could post stuff, we could post conspiracy theories and then through discourse figure out what is and isn't true.\"<|eot_id|>"}

The people inside the company should not be putting a thumb on the scale of what is and isn't allowed. You should create a mechanism for the people to decide what is and isn't allowed.

You and a lot of people are pretty snarky on Twitter, sometimes to the point of mockery derision, even a bit of, if I were to say, bad faith in the kind of mockery, and you see it as a war. I disagree with both you and Elon on this. Elon sees Twitter as a war zone, or at least has saw it that way in the past.

But it's really tricky. But like you, I'm very uncomfortable in general, but then you kind of slowing down with any kind of censorship.
