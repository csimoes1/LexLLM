You have given a set of lectures on Nietzsche as part of the new Peterson Academy, and the lectures were powerful. There's some element of the contradictions, the tensions, the drama, the way you like, lock in on an idea, but then are struggling with that idea, all of that, that feels like it's a Nietzschean.<|eot_id|>"}

And yeah, it's been great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Taking each sentence seriously and deconstructing it and really struggling with it. I think underpinning that approach to writing requires deep respect for the person. I think if we approach writing with that kind of respect, you can take Orwell, you can take a lot of writers and really dig in on singular sentences.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>images and then into the actions. And that's what happens in a meaningful conversation. It's a very good way of understanding how we communicate linguistically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if the words spring to the full visual complexity and then that can then transform itself into action.<|eot_id|>"}

That's way deeper than just how you think about it or how you feel about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about not just profound thinkers, but thinkers that deliver a powerful idea, for example, utopian ideas of Marx or utopian ideas, you could say dystopian ideas of Hitler?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right. Even a certain set of emotions as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's intense and it's direct, and they're so powerful that they completely altered the perception and the words spring to life.<|eot_id|>"}

But he didn't mean the power motivation that people like Foucault or Marx became so hung up on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's not power like you're trying to destroy the other. It's power, full flourishing of a human being, the creative force of a human being in that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say with the ethos that governs western societies, free western societies, there's really a qualitative difference, and it's not some morally relativistic illusion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we just look at the nuance of Nietzsche's thought, the idea he first introduced in Thus Spoke Zarathustra of the Ubermensch. That's another one that's very easy to misinterpret because it sounds awfully a lot like it's about power. For example, in the 20th century, it was misrepresented and co-opted by Hitler to advocate for the extermination of the inferior non-Aryan races.<|eot_id|>"}

Postmodernists are a good example of that as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. But if we lay on the table, religion, communism, Nazism, they are all unifying ethos. They're unifying ideas, but they're also horribly dividing ideas. They both unify and divide. Religion has also divided people because in the nuances of how the different peoples wrestle with God, they have come to different conclusions, and then they use those conclusions that perhaps the people in power use those conclusions to then start wars, to start hatred, to divide.<|eot_id|>"}

And none of that's arbitrary.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But don't you think we both arrived to this conversation with rigid axioms?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of structure, because we wouldn't be able to understand each other or communicate if a lot of things weren't already assumed or taken for granted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How rigid is the hierarchy of axioms that religion provides? This is what I'm trying to understand, the rigidity of that hierarchy.<|eot_id|>"}

But it makes you more than you are, and there's a directionality in that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The reason I like talking about communism because it has clearly been shown as a set of ideas to be destructive to humanity. But I would like to understand from an engineering perspective the characteristics of communism versus religion where you could identify religious thought is going to lead to a better human being, a better society and communist Marxist thought does not. Because there's ambiguity, there's room for play in communism and Marxism, because they had a utopian sense of where everybody's headed, don't know how it's going to happen. Maybe revolution is required. But after the revolution is done, we'll figure it out. And there's an underlying assumption that maybe human beings are good and they'll figure it out once you remove the oppressor. I mean, all these ideas, until you put them into practice, it can be quite convincing if you were in the 19th century. If I was reading, which is fascinating, the 19th century produced such powerful ideas, Marx and Nietzsche.<|eot_id|>"}

And the free market answer to that is something like, well, if you get the price right, people will buy it and you'll survive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is a fascinating way to describe how ideas fail. So communism perhaps fails because just like with people who believe the earth is flat, when you look outside, it looks flat, but you can't see beyond the horizon, I guess. In the same way with communism, communism seems like a great idea in my family and people I love, but it doesn't scale.<|eot_id|>"}

So one over-representation, psychopathy online with anonymity. That's a serious fascinating problem.

But in terms of the pattern of stuff we see online, my hope is that a lot of people on the extreme left and extreme right, or just the trolls in general are just young people kind of going through the similar stuff that we've been talking about, trying on the cynicism and the resentment.

Let's look at Nietzsche. He suffered through several health issues throughout his life, migraines, eyesight issues, digestive problems, depression with suicidal thoughts, and yet he is one of the greatest minds in the history of humanity.
