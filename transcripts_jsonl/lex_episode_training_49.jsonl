And all you hear from the other side, which dominates the discourse and dominates every element of your existence, are promises of complete erasure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as Malcolm X did, you're calling for highlighting the asymmetry in violence and asymmetry in moral reasoning.<|eot_id|>"}

When Malcolm said that if you stick a knife nine inches into my back and pull it out six inches, that's not progress. Progress is healing the wounds, and you're not even willing to acknowledge that the knife is there yet. Those that don't acknowledge what is determined now by any international human rights organization, even Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem and others, to be apartheid, a state of apartheid and a state of occupation, and now an unfolding genocide, are not partners for peace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just hurts me to think how long it takes to heal. Even if the healing begins now, with the knife metaphor, it's just going to be generations.

The urgency of the world right now should be entirely focused on ending this atrocity that, unfortunately, the world has become so complacent with. Again, prior to October 7th, the status quo was not acceptable, and there was no means in sight in the global arena to rein this in, to make Israel more accountable to stop this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was wondering if you can comment on a idea and notion that comes up often in conversations about this, of why can't other nations in the region take in Palestinian refugees?<|eot_id|>"}

I was listening to Nikki Haley, when she said in one of her interviews, \"Why is it that you think no one wants to take the Palestinians in?\" She had this deeply disturbing laugh to it. Or Ben Shapiro, when he said, \"Israelis like to build and Arabs like to bomb crap and live in their sewage.\" Or, \"Why is it that no one wants to govern the Palestinians?\" suggesting that Palestinians are ungovernable and not fit to bring into your countries, and that's why they're being turned away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How difficult has it been for people in Gaza to flee?<|eot_id|>"}

You can't bomb Palestine out of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine out of our hearts. I think that's a critical mistake that Israel is making. It thinks that if it destroys Gaza enough, if it wipes out all the buildings, that people will never want to come back. But we don't want to go anywhere, as a Palestinian people, in a way that would remove us from our homes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The Palestinian people are proud people.<|eot_id|>"}

I think those of us that are in diaspora, Palestine is not leaving our hearts, and those of us that are still there are not leaving their land. The world has to make the occupier more accountable, not tell the occupied how to cope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you ever imagine that if your family did not flee and you were now living, say in Gaza, what you would be doing?<|eot_id|>"}

I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on their behalf, but I'm also guilty that they have to bear the brunt of this evil hatred that unfortunately displaced our parents in the first place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned that Palestinians invoke the plight of Indigenous people like Native Americans.

We are living here in the United States on stolen lands that is drenched in the blood of the Natives, and that was built upon with the blood, sweat, and labor of enslaved Africans that were brought from overseas. It's a great evil that we have to reckon with constantly, so I think that's the power of solidarity. If you look in Canada and you look in places like Australia, there has been a refocus on the crimes against the Indigenous of those places.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why is Palestine a special place, a holy land?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the land of prophets. It is a land that holds deep significance, obviously to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It's the land of Abraham, peace be upon him. It is the land that has such a rich history to it that connects multiple peoples in multiple ways. It's precious. I think that history, while it tells the story of tragedy and struggle over that piece of land, also tells a beautiful story of sanctity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mention Abraham, prophets. Prophet Muhammad is deeply venerated in Islam, obviously, but other prophets are as well, Jesus being one of them. What are the similarities and differences in the teachings from these two prophets?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>God in the way that he commands you to serve him. So to us, as it says in the Quran that we do not distinguish between the prophets, all of the prophets came with one message, one mission. There's a coherence in the creed. There is a beauty in the foundation of what would become the legislation of each of those prophets, and we see them all as siblings in prophethood. And so we love the prophets of God and we believe that they each came with the legislation that was necessary for the time, but with the same message.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the message is fundamentally the same. Is there a difference in emphasis, for example, the emphasis on love with Jesus?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>changes within legislation, changes within the divine law, but the divine spirit remained the same. And so I don't see them as being counter to each other, nor do I see that any prophet betrayed the message that came before them. I think they're all part of the same beautiful message that we have to be at harmony with our creator and that we turn towards him for our guidance, and that when we do so, we establish a greater existence here on earth. And so I think that that's something that's consistent throughout the message of all the prophets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have been longtime friends with and had amazing conversations with people of other faiths, Christian, Jewish. How has the events of October 7th and the days after affected this in the United States? Your ability to have interfaith conversations, connections, relationships, friendships.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Complicated. Very complicated. And it's not just Muslims and Jews, it's also Christian Zionists. Christian Zionism is at the root of the problem, in my opinion, especially when we talk about what drives America's unshakable, unconditional commitment to Israel. It's devastating, I think, to Palestinian Christians in particular when Israel can bomb some of the oldest churches of Christianity in Gaza and kill Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Christians are barred from going to the Holy Sepulcher or to their places of worship in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, and Christians here in the United States turn their back on them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you wish more rabbis would be able to have a conversation like we're having today and also not allow it to be seen as them turning their back on their religion?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Rabbis, pastors, again, it's not just Jewish leadership; it's also Christian leadership. I think that it's important for those that have claimed to be allies in the fight against Islamophobia, to see that you cannot be opposed to Islamophobia while also extending anti-Palestinian bigotry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, one of the things since we last spoke, I've gotten to meet a lot of Palestinian Christians, including in West Bank, and that was fascinating. And those are beautiful people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think people should watch Reverend Munther Isaac's sermon on Christmas, Jesus in the Rubble. It was deeply profound. I had a chance to speak to Mitri Raheb from the Lutheran Church there as well. No, they're devastated. It was eyeopening to many people here when Justin Amash, who was a Republican congressman, right, Palestinian Christian, Republican congressman, posted about his own family dying in one of the church bombings. So it's strange, strange times. And I think that it shows that the philosophy of hate that drives this terrible policy is secular at it's root and not religious.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the criticisms of Islam points to specific verses of the Quran and the criticism being that it is not a religion of peace. Can you speak to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>than that, contextualizing the birth of Islam, the revelation of the Quran, which was over 23 years in response to deep persecution of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, makes it very clear that none of those verses are what they've been made out to be. If Muslims believed that they had to kill people wherever they are, mankind would not exist. There are two billion of us, right? If we believe that we were called by the Quran to hurt people and to kill people simply for being non-believers, right, it would not make for a sustainable world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think these narratives have taken hold in present discourse, at least in the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>greater violence against the Muslim community domestically and abroad. The United States has launched wars against primarily Muslim countries, right? And has a particularly violent foreign policy towards the Muslim world. And the Muslim community here in the United States has dealt with, unfortunately, multiple aggressive iterations of programs of suppression and surveillance under Republican and Democratic administrations. And so there's a convenience to that Islamophobia. There's a convenience to that framing of the Muslim community that also distracts from other forms of violence that are deeply pervasive and present, including the ones that are committed by the government itself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If it's okay, you've mentioned al-Aqsa Mosque a couple of times. I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we honor it. And Masjid al-Aqsa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj, the night journey of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also the first Qibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca and prayer, for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem in their prayer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the al-Aqsa Mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Ka'bah itself that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself. And so when I see a person in Gaza aggressed upon, when I see one [foreign language 02:07:36], when I see one child, that's greater to me than even al-Aqsa. But al-Aqsa is at the heart of who we are as well. And it's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets, and it's a place that should be treated prophetically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned to me that since October 7th, a lot of young people in the United States and in general have been showing interest in Islam. First of all, can you explain what you've been seeing and experiencing in terms of that trend?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Quran TikTok trends where you had a few people that went on camera and said, \"I'm reading the Quran for the first time.\" And I think that that's the beauty of the faith of the people of Gaza, the beauty of their resilience. When you're looking at these people living what's hell on earth, but they're seeking paradise outside, and they're able to still be inspired towards words of faith, and determination, and certainty, you're like, what is their secret? What are they reading? What are they on that allows them to still face this brutality with such grace, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's a good way to get introduced to Islam, the faith, the spiritual experience of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a bit, experience it, listen to the sermon, meet people from different backgrounds, and ask questions. Muslims love to be asked, by the way, about their faith because they're so sick of hearing other people talk about it. So Muslims love to be asked about their faith. Palestinians love to be asked about Palestine because they're so sick of other people talking about it. So ask questions, and you will have them answered. But there's nothing like a physical connection. There's nothing like a human connection. So definitely try to reach out to your local Islamic organizations and meet people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How difficult is it to convert to Islam?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>when you testify to the oneness of God and to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, being his final prophet, you are accepting what's known as the six articles of faith. Six articles of faith are belief in one God, belief in the angels, belief in the messengers. So you can't be a Muslim without believing in Jesus, or Moses, or Abraham, or Muhammad to believe in the messages that God has spoken to humanity through divine revelation. The Quran being the last revelation to believe in the day of Judgment and to believe in divine decree and predestination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because for you as a Palestinian-American this year, the Ramadan perhaps would be especially difficult spiritually.

This time we're going in, and if this is still ongoing, we are dealing with a continued genocide. So I think that the mood has been somber in the community. The mood has been different from anything I've ever seen before. So I anticipate this Ramadan would be different from anything we've ever seen before. I think the focus will continue to be on Gaza, and on either stopping the aggression on Gaza, or beginning the rebuilding of Gaza.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a general heaviness permeates just your prayers and your thoughts throughout this?<|eot_id|>"}

We also have people in our communities that have lost 20, 30, 40 people in our midst. It's not the same. If we start to have refugees or people that escape for medical treatment or that are able to get out through Egypt and join their families. It's becoming more real, right? It's becoming more personal for people. So I think that Ramadan will surround both in terms of messaging as well as community, the pain of the moment with a prayer for hope and healing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to put you on the spot, but in your sermons, in your private life, what is the passage in the Quran that is one you find yourself returning to often?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>language 02:16:42]. Your Lord does not forget. Your Lord does not forget. And so, as you see what's transpiring right now, our hope is not in creation, our hope is in our Creator. And our hope is not in this life, our hope is in the afterlife. And so that verse deeply resonates because I think that many of us often wonder how are they going to build? How are they going to get past this? And we know that God has a way of restoring everything. God will restore everything, if not in this life, then in the next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's an eternal flame of hope that burns there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and the people of Gaza have it. The people of Gaza have it. You can be more easily deluded by this material world if you're hostage to it. But the people of Gaza have never been deluded by the material world because they never really had it. They've always been attached to a greater idea, to a greater place. And so it is part of the secret ingredient that they have, that they believe in something greater than this. And so you can't survive hell on earth unless you believe in paradise outside of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you look far into the future, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're doing another podcast, and 80s and 90-years-old, what do you hope to see in the Middle East?

And then that drives horrific policies towards people that are so distant from us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have been fearless in walking through the fire.
