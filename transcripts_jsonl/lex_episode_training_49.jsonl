And so, when we talk about this not existing in a vacuum, if people only hear about Gaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the problem.

Why is it that the plight of the people of Gaza is not brought up until an attack happens on Israel?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Imam Dr. Omar Suleiman, his second time on the podcast. He is a Palestinian American, a Muslim scholar, a civil rights leader, president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, and is one of the most influential Muslims in the world. Our previous conversation was focused on Islam. This time the focus was on Gaza and Palestine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the first feeling was that there's going to be a lot of death and destruction in Gaza as a result. We always kind of see this where one Israeli casualty leads to hundreds of Palestinian casualties, right? So, it's a pretty familiar cycle in some ways where there are daily transgressions against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza, the checkpoints, the aggression on Mosque Al-Aqsa, the settlements expanding, the stories of Palestinian death. And then you have rockets fired from Gaza, and that's when the Western press catches up and starts to cover it. Israel responds with Hellfire missiles, white phosphorus bombs, and the casualties are wildly disproportionate. And so, I think that I wasn't surprised. I prayed for the people that I knew were going to bear the brunt of this outbreak, but the outbreak was predictable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote a statement on October 9th. I was hoping to read it, if it's okay?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, go ahead.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Our Palestinian casualties are always your footnotes. The daily humiliation of occupation ignored, the aggression by settlers and soldiers alike on holy sites and souls, the annihilation of entire families that follows, the devastation of whatever scraps remain in the open air prison of Gaza, unsustainable and inhumane. So, if you're waking up to a sudden interest in the region and want to know what's been happening, dig a bit deeper than two weeks and try to read beyond the headlines of a media that has been dehumanizing us for decades.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Again, this was not surprising. This was very predictable. If you've been watching what's been unfolding before October 7th, 2021, Human Rights Watch puts out the report, Threshold reached, Israel is an apartheid state. Amnesty International 2022, the crime of apartheid, showing how all of the legal determinations of apartheid have been reached, the occupations only getting more aggressive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned settlements.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. You can't disconnect Gaza from Palestine. You can't disconnect the West Bank from Palestine. You can't disconnect Jerusalem from Palestine. And you can't disconnect the very human story from the political plight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the Palestinians in the diaspora feeling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think deeply frustrated, a great sense of anger, sadness. Every single Palestinian right now knows someone that's been killed. Every single Palestinian is a part of a story of displacement or destruction. Every single Palestinian has a relative that's either missing a limb or a loved one. Every single Palestinian in the world is traumatized by this. And in some ways, being outside of Palestine, being away from it all hurts even more because you see your people being killed, and starved, and brutalized, and slaughtered, and you can't do anything about it. And the people around you are justifying that slaughter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're somebody who's always rushed into the midst of a crisis.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's really hard. I mean, when any group of people are killed, my instinct, and I think a lot of people is to go there to help, whether it's a natural disaster or especially after an incident of terror, wherever it is. It's rush there and do the best that you can to help people get through it. So, it's been extremely hard to watch this from afar and feel like I can't do anything about it.

He has seen the worst of the occupation before. He's seen the worst of the genocide while on TV. I mean, and this is insane when you think about it. We have over a hundred journalists now, that's more than any conflict in history, that have been killed. And there is sufficient evidence by international watchdogs that this is intentional. That journalists have been killed intentionally, but then their families.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have posted videos and written about what is happening in Gaza since October 7th.

So, every aspect of Gazan life has been under occupation. I would argue that it's an injustice to even call it an open air prison because inmates are not bombed in prisons routinely by the most sophisticated weapons in the world. Regular bombardment of Gaza, every single person in Gaza has lived through multiple rounds of bombardment. It is deeply distressing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, pragmatically and psychologically, it's very difficult to flourish when you're just waiting for more bombardment.<|eot_id|>"}

There's a cultural genocide as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, those kids growing up in Gaza now, to you, they have almost no choice but to have hatred for Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's human. I mean, look, any child that is under that type of oppression is going to hate their oppressor. I don't care who you are. I don't care what you are. But here's my problem with how that gets brought up. You're talking about the future of the security of Israel. Even some people that speak about it seemingly from a place of being well-meaning, that say the only way that Israel can have its security is to stop killing Palestinians. And so, the future of Israel depends upon Palestinians not hating Israel so much.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You don't pass out candy in a concentration camp, you and the occupation. And so, there has to be a solution that is beyond merely acts of kindness. At the end of the day, if you're occupying a people, you have to remove that occupation. Apartheid is not dealt with by acts of kindness on the part of the occupying power. Apartheid is dealt with by ending apartheid. And so, there has to be a level of accountability. It's not just acts of kindness. It's not just treating the people with more dignity. It's giving them the ability to pursue their own dignity. To depend on the benevolence of my occupier, and when my occupier feels like throwing me a few more crumbs, it has to end. There has to be a point now where the world says this is not sustainable. It's not just about ending the present genocide. A ceasefire is the bare minimum. I think any decent human being would be calling for a ceasefire right now, but at some point you cease occupation, you cease apartheid because what led to the ability of Israel to carry out a genocide without any accountability was that the global arena has permitted it to do so, largely due to American obstruction of justice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is violence an effective method of resistance?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, the framework that I would propose is that Dr. King mentioned that peace is not the absence of violence, it's the presence of justice. And so, occupation and apartheid are violent even in their most benevolent manifestations. The default of occupation is that it is unjustified. The default of apartheid is that it is unjustified, and it must be dealt with. The default of resistance to occupation and apartheid is that it is justified, but there can be transgressions even in resisting occupation and apartheid, right? And I come to this from an Islamic perspective. My moral framework is Islam. The prophet Muhammad, peace be upon Him, was outraged when he saw a woman or a child that was dead from the other side, the side of his persecutor. And so, yes, we have a saying as Muslims that they are not our teachers. Our oppressors are not our teachers, but the concept of resistance to occupation, it is morally justified. It is justified by international law. Any occupied people have the right to defend themselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, you did talk about [inaudible 00:35:37] and dignity, and you mentioned transgressions, so there is places where violence can go too far?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. So violence, again, the point is that you ask yourself why we've been silent about the violence all of this time. And you know what? When people say, \"Well, what about this? Well, what about that?\" My response is this. What I would love to see is effective international bodies of justice, being able to reign in any party that has committed an act of aggression or committed an act of injustice and hold them accountable. Any reasonable human being would say, \"Yeah, you know what? There should be effective international bodies that can reign in parties that can't be reigned in domestically, that could stop the violence. That could assign blame properly, and then have methods of accountability.\" The problem is that Israel has been made invincible in the international arena because of the United States. And then we wonder why there's such a rise in global anti-American sentiment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, to you, violence becomes terrorism when women and children, non-combatants, are killed, no matter who is doing the killing?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It feels like there is a return to some of the days after 911, the dehumanization, the feeling of complete disregard for our humanity at the level of government, at the level of media. Feeling of an increase in surveillance, the feeling in an increase in bigotry. People are losing their jobs, and people are being berated on campuses, in grocery stores, and people are being killed. I went to the funeral of a 6-year-old boy who was killed directly due to anti-Palestinian propaganda. And so I think that a lot of us are feeling a return to that, but we also refuse to be cornered into a position where we are told to perpetually condemn acts of violence and not speak about the violence that's committed against us here or abroad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you tell the story of this boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume?

What are you going to do about the global day of Jihad?\" It's like, \"What are you talking about?\" It's like, \"Well, Hamas has called for a global day of Jihad, so how are you going to stop Muslims from attacking people?\" Right?

She fought him off, escaped to call 911. And while she is calling 911, she hears Wadea. Wadea ran up to the man, calling him Uncle Joe because the landlord prior to that, had been kind to them, used to give Wadea toys. Wadea had an infectious, beautiful smile. Every picture you see of that kid, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful smile. And so, Wadea runs up to him, says, \"Uncle Joe.\" He runs up to him to give him a hug, even though he's carrying a military grade knife with blood on it, because Wadea doesn't believe that harm can come to him from that man. And Hanaan didn't think that he would do anything to her kid, even in that fit of rage. The last thing that she says she heard was, \"Oh, no,\" Wadea the says, \"Oh, no.\" And then, he starts to stab him 26 times, says, \"You, Muslims, must die.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is a deep geopolitical connection between the United States and that part of the world.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We need another podcast. That's going to take a few hours to talk about where Joe Biden has failed. For one, the first time he seemed to find the word Palestinian in his vocabulary was when he accused the Palestinians of lying about the death toll in Gaza. And then, that turned out to also be false. In fact, the numbers that were coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry, according to multiple international bodies, have been underreporting Palestinian casualty counts. Israeli intelligence has said that the civilian count or the death toll is actually higher than what's been coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry, so he's failed on that front. ... of reflection. This is a moment of restoration if you want it to be, right? And to think about what we've enabled in the first place, he's shown absolutely no real empathy, and I think that he is under great delusion in thinking that the Muslim community or people of conscience are going to forgive this, are going to forget this come November.

And Joe Biden is already a failed democracy, and so he never had the hearts and minds of the Muslim community. People always saw past his rhetoric. He always has had a terrible disposition towards Palestine. He's always had a terrible disposition towards the Muslim world.

Whereas when the Stand With Israel Rally happened between the 300,000 strong Palestine rally and the 400,000 strong Palestine rally, there was a Stand with Israel rally where congressmen were bused from Congress to speak at that rally, Democrats and Republicans and high profile celebrities, and it was live-streamed across multiple places. I have to say this, the ICJ, if that wasn't the greatest display of media bias in the domain of United States mainstream media, then I don't know what is.

I see it every single time. But the overwhelming tenor of all of these protests has been consistent. It's been calling for freedom. It's been calling for liberation. It's been calling for an end to the genocide, a ceasefire, an end to the occupation, an end to the apartheid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the average sentiment is anti- occupation, not anti-Semitic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's incredibly lazy to say that anti-Zionism or that anti-occupation is anti-Semitic.

The Muslim community has been at the forefront of condemning anti-Semitism. We have stood in front of synagogues. We have stood with the Jewish community when the Jewish community is attacked. This is about occupation. This is a story of a colonial entity that has driven us out of our homes and has done so in such a way that has forced us to try to be the voice of a people that are being exterminated overseas right now.

It's pretty unfair when you judge the entire protest movement by some of these incidents that have happened at protests, and you don't pay attention to what they're protesting about in the first place, which is a genocide. Right now, everything is secondary to ending a genocide that is ongoing. In the course of this discussion, it's not an exaggeration to say that at least 30, 40 people would've been killed just over the last few hours because we're averaging 135 to 150 a day. So everything else is secondary to that. This is where we all need to be right now as people of conscience. How do we stop this?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think that's factual. Look, anti-Semitism is always to be condemned. It's wrong.

Synagogues should be protected, and if a person is attacked for being Jewish, we will be the first to go and to stand with them and to reject that attack on them.

The people that live in Gaza and the people that live in the West Bank, the Palestinians have had their identity stolen from them. So there's the freedom of movement. There is the freedom of thriving. There is self-determination. All of that has been stolen from the people of Gaza. There's no airport in Gaza, that was destroyed by Israel as well. It is an occupation at every level and by any meaningful legal determination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about Yemen's Houthi rebels attacking Israel in response to October 7th and then the United States and the UK initiating bombing of multiple targets in Yemen in response to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think that it's clear that the United States cares more about its shipping lanes than it does about Palestinian lives, and that actually has proved it. Look, I do not support the Houthis as Houthis or their policies in general, but if you look at what has transpired and what they have said, they're attacking these ships in response to the occupation or in response to the genocide and saying that they will continue to do so, to stop business as usual until a ceasefire is reached. They have not killed anyone. They have seized ships. They have blocked the lanes, but they have said that if a ceasefire happens, they will cease their activity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned paying respects to the legacy of EBJ, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and remembering Palestinian child prisoners. Can you explain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson was one of the few co-sponsors of a bill that has been on the floor of Congress for years, initially sponsored by Congresswoman Betty McCollum to penalize Israel for its detention of child prisoners. Thousands of children arbitrarily detained, put in military courts, solitary confinement, and yes, sexual violence that's been documented by human rights organizations against them, and there have been no repercussions. So I want you to think about this, just the thought of conditioning aid to Israel so that it doesn't indiscriminately bomb entire populations has not been able to find any home in mainstream American politics. For years. Just trying to stop Israel from picking up children and throwing them into military prisons where they disappear for decades at times, has not found any thrust in mainstream American politics. Whereas any resolution that is pro-Israel will make it past both chambers relatively quickly. Two million people in Gaza are hostages. Every Palestinian that lives under occupation is a hostage. But all of those prisoners that have been picked up, women, children, innocent people with absolutely no process of making sure that they're treated right, or given fair trials, or even given a communication line with their families, or with any government to help them, is absolutely criminal. All of those prisoners are also hostages. When you already propose this idea that there are Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, you're already implying that one group is complicit in their own devastation, whereas another group has had devastation visited upon them entirely out of their own doing. So it's important for people to learn about children prisoners who are indeed hostages to an apartheid system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to you, big peace agreements of the like of Abraham Accords should include Palestine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Abraham Accords is nothing but an agreement in which you slap the name of Abraham on arms deals. In exchange for countries being able to undertake their own unholy pursuits, they use one of the holiest names in history and continue to erase the main victims of this atrocity. So the Abraham Accords are an insult to humanity, an insult to the Palestinians, an insult to the name of Abraham.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But do you think something like that, agreements of that nature, of that scale, could be made that include the Palestinian people and that would actually make progress?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If they're honest to the plight of the Palestinians. If they are honest to the roots of the problem, absolutely. Look, again, peace is sought, but peace cannot be used to silence. The entire peace process has been hung over the Palestinians all of these years while settlements continue to expand and their situation only continue to get worse. Is Israel really going to remove the 700,000, 800,000 settlers and suddenly change its tune on a two-state solution? Benjamin Netanyahu is saying right now, and he's speaking to, unfortunately, what is clearly a majority of the Israeli public, that there will never be a Palestinian state. So these peace talks cannot be used to suffocate all of the work of justice and bringing Israel to accountability. The world has to act when they see apartheid. The world has to act when they see occupation. If the world fails to bring Israel to a place of accountability, then a few countries that have their own agendas cannot put forth anything meaningful for the victims of Israel, being the Palestinian people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of questions I want to ask you about the nature of resistance and what is the proper way to resist. What is the practical, pragmatic, effective ways of resisting. One example that is often brought up is the difference between MLK and Malcolm X. One emphasized nonviolent resistance, the other emphasized any-means-necessary resistance. Which do you side with in general, and in this particular case of what has happened over the past 100-plus days?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In general, that framing relies on a sanitization of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and a vilification of Malcolm X, that a lot of people do put forth and present as two polar opposites in how they approached the plight of Black people in America and resisting racism here in America. When I taught a course at Southern Methodist University on MLK, and Malcolm X, and Islam, and the Civil Rights Movement, what I'd often do is I'd give my students a set of quotes. I would say, \"Assign this to Malcolm or Martin.\" and they'd always get it wrong, right? You can find quotes from MLK in Breaking the Silence, and especially when he took a stand against the Vietnam War, that sound so radical when you compare them to the image of MLK. And Malcolm is, of course, turned into this militant, angry Muslim who just wanted violence and was seeking chaos here in the United States.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about the seeming fact the majority of Palestinians support the October 7th attacks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have to see their world through their eyes. You can't try to see their world through your eyes. If you live under occupation, you're routinely harassed at Israeli checkpoints. The occupation is expanding into your territory. You're meeting families regularly that have been thrown out of their homes and that are looking for a new place in this shrinking territory. You deal with routine airstrikes. You have no way to get out. You have no way to grow. You don't even have a passport. Your education is subpar. Your standards of living are lower than the rest of the world. And all you hear from the other side, which dominates the discourse and dominates every element of your existence, are promises of complete erasure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as Malcolm X did, you're calling for highlighting the asymmetry in violence and asymmetry in moral reasoning.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. It's important. You're not going to be able to solve this problem unless you're able to do that. When Malcolm said that if you stick a knife nine inches into my back and pull it out six inches, that's not progress. Progress is healing the wounds, and you're not even willing to acknowledge that the knife is there yet. Those that don't acknowledge what is determined now by any international human rights organization, even Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem and others, to be apartheid, a state of apartheid and a state of occupation, and now an unfolding genocide, are not partners for peace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just hurts me to think how long it takes to heal. Even if the healing begins now, with the knife metaphor, it's just going to be generations. Because people don't forget when your father and mother were murdered, or somebody that you know in your family was killed. They don't forget.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look, I think the point is that we have to come to terms with the fact that the trauma of the past does not justify the murder of the present, and the fear of the future does not justify the murder of the present. The urgency of the world right now should be entirely focused on ending this atrocity that, unfortunately, the world has become so complacent with. Again, prior to October 7th, the status quo was not acceptable, and there was no means in sight in the global arena to rein this in, to make Israel more accountable to stop this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was wondering if you can comment on a idea and notion that comes up often in conversations about this, of why can't other nations in the region take in Palestinian refugees?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that we have to tackle what's implied by that at multiple levels, and I actually want to walk back. I was listening to Nikki Haley, when she said in one of her interviews, \"Why is it that you think no one wants to take the Palestinians in?\" She had this deeply disturbing laugh to it. Or Ben Shapiro, when he said, \"Israelis like to build and Arabs like to bomb crap and live in their sewage.\" Or, \"Why is it that no one wants to govern the Palestinians?\" suggesting that Palestinians are ungovernable and not fit to bring into your countries, and that's why they're being turned away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How difficult has it been for people in Gaza to flee?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, they're blockaded from all directions. There is nowhere for people in Gaza to go. They cannot get out, and the reality is that they don't want to leave. They do not want to leave. The Palestinian people want to live in their land, in their homes, and to continue to produce an extension of the beautiful culture and legacy that was handed to them. They don't want to leave. In fact, those that have fled for whatever reason, or have been able to get out for medical treatment, or because they have some sort of citizenship in other countries, all they're talking about is going back and rebuilding. You can't bomb Palestine out of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine out of our hearts. I think that's a critical mistake that Israel is making. It thinks that if it destroys Gaza enough, if it wipes out all the buildings, that people will never want to come back. But we don't want to go anywhere, as a Palestinian people, in a way that would remove us from our homes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The Palestinian people are proud people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you've met a lot of them, right? When you sat with Mohammed El-Kurd, or people in East Jerusalem, what those people have been subjected to, the harassment. Think about the tenacity and the character that it takes to still try to walk back into your home after an intruder has been brought in by the state, that's sitting in your living room, that is pushing you around, and you're saying, \"I'm not leaving my home.\" This is literally what's been happening in East Jerusalem, and we're not going anywhere. I think those of us that are in diaspora, Palestine is not leaving our hearts, and those of us that are still there are not leaving their land. The world has to make the occupier more accountable, not tell the occupied how to cope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you ever imagine that if your family did not flee and you were now living, say in Gaza, what you would be doing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think about what could've been all the time. I actually mentioned this in the first D.C. protest, that I remember getting a news notification just prior to October, with my name in it. I always get these notifications, right, if my name has been mentioned in an article. So, \"Oh, your name has been mentioned in an article.\" and it was a 16-year-old Omar Suleiman who was murdered in the West Bank. He literally had my name. I held up his picture and I realized that could've been me. So I think of why God chose me to not be there, and hopefully Him choosing all of us that are not there to be for those that are still there, to be their voices. I'm grateful and I'm also in pain. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on their behalf, but I'm also guilty that they have to bear the brunt of this evil hatred that unfortunately displaced our parents in the first place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned that Palestinians invoke the plight of Indigenous people like Native Americans. What works and doesn't work about this analogy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that there's a powerful connection between the Palestinian people and the Indigenous in this land and in other places that have been wronged. We are living here in the United States on stolen lands that is drenched in the blood of the Natives, and that was built upon with the blood, sweat, and labor of enslaved Africans that were brought from overseas. It's a great evil that we have to reckon with constantly, so I think that's the power of solidarity. If you look in Canada and you look in places like Australia, there has been a refocus on the crimes against the Indigenous of those places.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why is Palestine a special place, a holy land?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the land of prophets. It is a land that holds deep significance, obviously to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It's the land of Abraham, peace be upon him. It is the land that has such a rich history to it that connects multiple peoples in multiple ways. It's precious. I think that history, while it tells the story of tragedy and struggle over that piece of land, also tells a beautiful story of sanctity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mention Abraham, prophets. Prophet Muhammad is deeply venerated in Islam, obviously, but other prophets are as well, Jesus being one of them. What are the similarities and differences in the teachings from these two prophets?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, Islam refers to this idea of submission to one God and attaining peace in the process. And refers to the way of life that prophets have all come with, which is this idea of monotheism, and serving that one God in the way that he commands you to serve him. So to us, as it says in the Quran that we do not distinguish between the prophets, all of the prophets came with one message, one mission. There's a coherence in the creed. There is a beauty in the foundation of what would become the legislation of each of those prophets, and we see them all as siblings in prophethood. And so we love the prophets of God and we believe that they each came with the legislation that was necessary for the time, but with the same message.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the message is fundamentally the same. Is there a difference in emphasis, for example, the emphasis on love with Jesus?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's like when you talk about MLK and Malcolm to an extent, except there was actually some difference, right, between MLK and Malcolm. I just think that the difference is exaggerated between them. But I don't think that Moses didn't emphasize love, but Jesus emphasized love. And then Muhammad didn't emphasize love, peace be upon them all. I think that they each emphasized the same attributes and names of God and ways of knowing God. But there were, of course, changes within legislation, changes within the divine law, but the divine spirit remained the same. And so I don't see them as being counter to each other, nor do I see that any prophet betrayed the message that came before them. I think they're all part of the same beautiful message that we have to be at harmony with our creator and that we turn towards him for our guidance, and that when we do so, we establish a greater existence here on earth. And so I think that that's something that's consistent throughout the message of all the prophets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have been longtime friends with and had amazing conversations with people of other faiths, Christian, Jewish. How has the events of October 7th and the days after affected this in the United States? Your ability to have interfaith conversations, connections, relationships, friendships.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Complicated. Very complicated. And it's not just Muslims and Jews, it's also Christian Zionists. Christian Zionism is at the root of the problem, in my opinion, especially when we talk about what drives America's unshakable, unconditional commitment to Israel. It's devastating, I think, to Palestinian Christians in particular when Israel can bomb some of the oldest churches of Christianity in Gaza and kill Palestinian Christians, and Palestinian Christians are barred from going to the Holy Sepulcher or to their places of worship in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, and Christians here in the United States turn their back on them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you wish more rabbis would be able to have a conversation like we're having today and also not allow it to be seen as them turning their back on their religion?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Rabbis, pastors, again, it's not just Jewish leadership; it's also Christian leadership. I think that it's important for those that have claimed to be allies in the fight against Islamophobia, to see that you cannot be opposed to Islamophobia while also extending anti-Palestinian bigotry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, one of the things since we last spoke, I've gotten to meet a lot of Palestinian Christians, including in West Bank, and that was fascinating. And those are beautiful people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think people should watch Reverend Munther Isaac's sermon on Christmas, Jesus in the Rubble. It was deeply profound. I had a chance to speak to Mitri Raheb from the Lutheran Church there as well. No, they're devastated. It was eyeopening to many people here when Justin Amash, who was a Republican congressman, right, Palestinian Christian, Republican congressman, posted about his own family dying in one of the church bombings. So it's strange, strange times. And I think that it shows that the philosophy of hate that drives this terrible policy is secular at it's root and not religious.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the criticisms of Islam points to specific verses of the Quran and the criticism being that it is not a religion of peace. Can you speak to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So objectively speaking, if you were to take the verses of the Quran about violence and compare them just from a purely percentage-based comparison to the New Testament and the Old Testament, you would find less verses about war in the Quran than the Old Testament or the New Testament. And there are plenty of studies to speak to that. Deeper than that, contextualizing the birth of Islam, the revelation of the Quran, which was over 23 years in response to deep persecution of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, makes it very clear that none of those verses are what they've been made out to be. If Muslims believed that they had to kill people wherever they are, mankind would not exist. There are two billion of us, right? If we believe that we were called by the Quran to hurt people and to kill people simply for being non-believers, right, it would not make for a sustainable world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think these narratives have taken hold in present discourse, at least in the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because they allow for greater violence against the Muslim community domestically and abroad. The United States has launched wars against primarily Muslim countries, right? And has a particularly violent foreign policy towards the Muslim world. And the Muslim community here in the United States has dealt with, unfortunately, multiple aggressive iterations of programs of suppression and surveillance under Republican and Democratic administrations. And so there's a convenience to that Islamophobia. There's a convenience to that framing of the Muslim community that also distracts from other forms of violence that are deeply pervasive and present, including the ones that are committed by the government itself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If it's okay, you've mentioned al-Aqsa Mosque a couple of times. I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets. So all of the prophets that have walked in that place, all of the prophets that have worshiped in that place, all of that makes it sacred. So it's not separated from Muslims, from post-Muhammad, peace be upon him, versus prior to Muhammad, peace be upon him, in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we honor it. And Masjid al-Aqsa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as Al-Isra' wal-Mi'raj, the night journey of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also the first Qibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims faced Mecca and prayer, for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem in their prayer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the al-Aqsa Mosque. That's a foundational idea for Islam.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Ka'bah itself that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself. And so when I see a person in Gaza aggressed upon, when I see one [foreign language 02:07:36], when I see one child, that's greater to me than even al-Aqsa. But al-Aqsa is at the heart of who we are as well. And it's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets, and it's a place that should be treated prophetically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned to me that since October 7th, a lot of young people in the United States and in general have been showing interest in Islam. First of all, can you explain what you've been seeing and experiencing in terms of that trend?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we have Quran TikTok trends where you had a few people that went on camera and said, \"I'm reading the Quran for the first time.\" And I think that that's the beauty of the faith of the people of Gaza, the beauty of their resilience. When you're looking at these people living what's hell on earth, but they're seeking paradise outside, and they're able to still be inspired towards words of faith, and determination, and certainty, you're like, what is their secret? What are they reading? What are they on that allows them to still face this brutality with such grace, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's a good way to get introduced to Islam, the faith, the spiritual experience of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think, look, you go to our websites, you go to whyislam.org, you come to Yaqeen's website, yaqeeninstitute.org, you go to multiple Islamic websites to get those questions answered. But there's nothing like going to a mosque. There's nothing like actually going to a mosque, and meeting Muslims, and asking questions. And I tell people, you have to step out of your comfort zone and go there and let your world be complicated a bit, experience it, listen to the sermon, meet people from different backgrounds, and ask questions. Muslims love to be asked, by the way, about their faith because they're so sick of hearing other people talk about it. So Muslims love to be asked about their faith. Palestinians love to be asked about Palestine because they're so sick of other people talking about it. So ask questions, and you will have them answered. But there's nothing like a physical connection. There's nothing like a human connection. So definitely try to reach out to your local Islamic organizations and meet people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How difficult is it to convert to Islam?<|eot_id|>"}

And when you testify to the oneness of God and to the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, being his final prophet, you are accepting what's known as the six articles of faith. Six articles of faith are belief in one God, belief in the angels, belief in the messengers. So you can't be a Muslim without believing in Jesus, or Moses, or Abraham, or Muhammad to believe in the messages that God has spoken to humanity through divine revelation. The Quran being the last revelation to believe in the day of Judgment and to believe in divine decree and predestination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because for you as a Palestinian-American this year, the Ramadan perhaps would be especially difficult spiritually.

I hope that at that point we're rebuilding Gaza, talking about rebuilding Gaza, and helping people that have been damaged in so many different ways. I hope that Ramadan is turning a corner. Every Ramadan, the aggression against the Palestinian people seems to grow. So we're usually dealing with last the 10 nights of Ramadan, and then the incursions on Masjid al-Aqsa, really sour it for the entire Muslim world because you're watching worshipers being assaulted in one of the holiest places in the world. And at the same time, you're trying to find your deep connection, your own deep, holy connection in Ramadan. This time we're going in, and if this is still ongoing, we are dealing with a continued genocide. So I think that the mood has been somber in the community. The mood has been different from anything I've ever seen before. So I anticipate this Ramadan would be different from anything we've ever seen before. I think the focus will continue to be on Gaza, and on either stopping the aggression on Gaza, or beginning the rebuilding of Gaza.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a general heaviness permeates just your prayers and your thoughts throughout this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, look, every sermon I've given since October 7th has had to have some inclusion of this because it's what's on everyone's hearts and minds. We also have people in our communities that have lost 20, 30, 40 people in our midst. It's not the same. If we start to have refugees or people that escape for medical treatment or that are able to get out through Egypt and join their families. It's becoming more real, right? It's becoming more personal for people. So I think that Ramadan will surround both in terms of messaging as well as community, the pain of the moment with a prayer for hope and healing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to put you on the spot, but in your sermons, in your private life, what is the passage in the Quran that is one you find yourself returning to often?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The part of the Quran, I get asked this question, that resonates with me most usually has to do with what is heaviest for me at the moment. There is a verse in the chapter of Mary, a part of the verse, [foreign language 02:16:42]. Your Lord does not forget. Your Lord does not forget. And so, as you see what's transpiring right now, our hope is not in creation, our hope is in our Creator. And our hope is not in this life, our hope is in the afterlife. And so that verse deeply resonates because I think that many of us often wonder how are they going to build? How are they going to get past this? And we know that God has a way of restoring everything. God will restore everything, if not in this life, then in the next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's an eternal flame of hope that burns there.<|eot_id|>"}

You can be more easily deluded by this material world if you're hostage to it. But the people of Gaza have never been deluded by the material world because they never really had it. They've always been attached to a greater idea, to a greater place. And so it is part of the secret ingredient that they have, that they believe in something greater than this. And so you can't survive hell on earth unless you believe in paradise outside of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you look far into the future, 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're doing another podcast, and 80s and 90-years-old, what do you hope to see in the Middle East? What do you hope to see change in the Middle East and the United States as a people, as a set of policies, cultures, nations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that the nation-state model and nationalism are becoming so unsustainable just with the growth of refugee populations, desperate refugee populations. The rise of, unfortunately, fanaticism and fascism in different parts of the world, climate, and all that that presents to us in terms of displacement. We're going to have to figure out how to function as a world rather than as nations and states. We're going to have to figure out how to not see everyone outside of our borders as threats and people that are different from us within our borders as threats. We're going to have to start seeing people as people. And so my hope would be that we would have made people uncomfortable enough to transcend some of the barriers in their hearts and some of the barriers that we have in the world that don't allow us to see other people as people. And then that drives horrific policies towards people that are so distant from us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have been fearless in walking through the fire. What gives you strength psychologically to keep going, to speak out, but just also maintain an optimism and a hope for the future?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't believe that anyone gives me success or causes me failure without the permission of God. I don't seek fuel from anyone else. I don't seek hope from anyone else. I believe in a creator that has a greater plan, and I want to be a greater part of that plan. And I'm inspired by the resilience of the people of Gaza. I'm inspired by the resilience of my parents, and our grandparents, and Palestinians around the world that have refused to succumb to their erasure, that have refused to give up. And so we have both the energy that we need and we have the examples that we need. The energy is from above. The examples are all around us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Omar Imam, this is a huge honor to once again speak with you. And I just want to say thank you, not just for this, but for many private notes you have sent me of kindness, and support, and love through some of the low points, as silly as they are for me personally. So it's just great to be able to call you a friend and to be able to have you in my corner. I'm forever grateful to you for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I appreciate it. Thank you so much, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And thank you for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Omar Suleiman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you some words from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
