There is another way.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Tulsi Gabbard, who was a longtime Democrat, including being the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She endorsed Bernie in 2016 and Biden in 2020. She has been both loved and heavily criticized for her independent thinking and bold political stances, especially on topics of war and the military industrial complex. She served in the US military for many years, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. And now she's the author of a new book called For Love of Country. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Tulsi Gabbard. You've served in the US military for many years, achieving rank of Lieutenant Colonel. You were deployed in Iraq in 2004 and '05, Kuwait in '08 and '09. What lessons about life and about country have you learned from that experience of war?<|eot_id|>"}

And I knew somehow, someway I needed to find a way to use those experiences to try to make a positive impact, to try to influence those... I mean, frankly, the politicians who are making decisions to go and launch these regime-change wars and send our men and women in uniform into war, and to what end, ultimately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we can just go back to that list.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how it is the reality of war. Behind every one of those names on that list was a husband or a wife, parents, sons and daughters, family members, who had no idea what we were dealing with, really. All they knew was what they saw on the news. What my dad told me later when I got home after that deployment was that every time they saw the news, and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some IED, they held their breath until they saw or heard the news of who it was or what it was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What can you say about what the soldiers had to go through physically and psychologically when they get injured?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>building those relationships. Again, I served in a medical unit and what we saw was a downward shift in casualties from the unit that had been there before us, simply because of that basic human connection that our guys sought to make. And then, gradually, finding local people who lived in the town right next to us were saying, \"Hey, you guys, somebody was digging a big hole a mile down the road. You might want to bypass that or check that out.\" And finding weapons, caches and IEDs, improvised explosive devices, and other things that helped save people's lives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the cost side of things, how is it possible for a company like Halliburton or others to get away with $40 bananas?

Obviously, there are other companies that this is their business model. They get away with it because of their political connections, and the lobbyists that they have, the relationships they have with politicians. And ultimately, what President Eisenhower warned against with regard to that cozy relationship between Congress and even what he called then the military industrial complex, it's been alive and well. He warned us against it, and I would say it's thriving more now than ever before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How powerful is the military industrial complex as a thing?

He retired as a general officer, went and served on one of the boards for one of the big defense contractors, and then now back as the Secretary of Defense. We see the same thing in Congress with members of Congress and senior professional staffers in Congress. Same exact revolving door where you have people, whether they're writing contracts for the Department of Defense, for the company that then wins the bid for that contract, and then going and working for that company. Or those in Congress who are writing policies and doing exactly the same thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have been both a war hawk and a war dove at times.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>War is justified when it is in the best interest of our national security, and when it is the last resort, when all diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted and war is the last possible route that must be taken to ensure the safety, security, and freedom of the American people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's a high-level beautiful idea, but there's messy details.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The United States involvement in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan was in part the big umbrella of the war on terrorism.

To what degree is it possible to defeat terrorism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that they refused to accurately identify that ideology driving these terrorist groups. And instead said, \"We are countering violent extremism,\" was the term that the Obama administration started to use and was coined and kind of mandated across the US government. Well, again, you have to know the enemy that threatens you and why they're doing what they're doing if you have any hope of actually preventing their attack, both militarily, and as we're seeing now with Hamas's actions, not only directly in the assault on Israel, but how Hamas achieved their objectives in spreading their ideology around the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you look at the lessons learned from the US involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, how do you fight terrorism?<|eot_id|>"}

War is ugly and it is messy. It is also an unfortunate reality of the world we live in. So, while I firmly believe that we must always pursue peace, I'm not a pacifist, I'm a realist, and recognize that where there are these threats, we must do what we can to work towards that safety, that security, that freedom and peace that we all want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we look at the perspective of Israel and the Israel-Gaza war going on now, what do you do with the fact that the death of a civilian serves as a catalyst, gives birth to hate, potentially generational hate? So in Israel's stated goal of destroying Hamas, they are creating immeasurable hate. What do you do with that? From a perspective of Israel, what is the correct action to take in response to October 7th?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Palestinian people in Gaza at all and want them to go and repatriate in other countries, I think that's a big problem, and that further exacerbates this hatred and resentment that continues to grow there. This is a generation's long challenge, unfortunately, of the resentment and tension that exists between many Israelis and many Palestinians that can only be resolved when there's strong leadership representing both peoples who are able and willing to come together and recognize that the only way forward is to let the past be in the past and find a way towards peace in the future.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you think, how do you hope the war in Ukraine will end?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've enjoyed and appreciated the time that I've spent there. When I hear from my friends about how afraid they are of their husbands being conscripted and feeling like they have to hide for fear of being yanked off the streets, their friends and family members who've been killed in this war. The only way this ends is when both sides come to the table and find an agreement that neither side is going to be completely happy with, both sides being forced to make some concessions, but one where they will both walk away and this war can end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the role of the US president perhaps to bring everybody to the table? Do you think that the US president should sit down with Zelenskyy and Putin together?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>role that they have to take is actually encouraging Zelenskyy to sit down and begin this process. Those kinds of engagements are the most, to me, the most powerful exercises of diplomacy that can't be matched, especially when our president's foremost role and responsibility is to serve as commander in chief, and I wish that we had leaders who were more willing to engage because I think we'd make a lot more progress more quickly to find areas both of mutual interest as well as to help de-conflict and de-escalate areas where there is tension or disagreement or adversarial interests.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, some of it is basic human camaraderie. People call me naive for this, but sometimes, just knowing that there's a human on the other side. Even when it's in private, if you look at Zelenskyy and Putin for example, just humor. Both are very intelligent, witty at times, even funny people. Yes, this is wartime. Yes, a lot of civilians and soldiers are dying. There's hate, but if you can look above it all and think about the future of the countries, the flourishing of the people and the stopping of the death of civilians and soldiers, then in that place, you can have that basic human connection.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree. I don't think that's naive at all and I think there are so many examples through history that point to the power of that, the real power in that. In the Cuban Missile crisis, how JFK had to literally find a secret way to communicate with Khrushchev to try to go around the backs of the military commanders who were urging him to take military action, and instead find, hey, we both ultimately want the same thing. Neither of us wants to launch a catastrophic nuclear war so let's figure this out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course, there's examples throughout history. Leaders are complicated people. They're manipulative people, so you have Hitler and Chamberlain meeting and Chamberlain kind of getting hoodwinked by Hitler's charisma and being convinced that Hitler doesn't have any interest in invading and destroying the rest of the world, so you have to-<|eot_id|>"}

Don't be hoodwinked.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've met, and you've been criticized for this, you've met with Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and as part of the campaign when running for president, got criticized for not calling him a war criminal. What's the right way to meet and communicate with these kinds of leaders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>use of arming and equipping known terrorists within Syria to overthrow the regime,\" without them stating any realistic idea of who would take control once Assad was overthrown. But the reality actually being that no matter which opposition group they might try to prop up, they would not have the power to withstand the terrorist groups whose stated goal it was to go and take over power from Assad. They had no interest in trying to gain true understanding, and it was very disheartening. It was very disheartening and a big lesson learned about where their interests really were focused.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's a simplistic narrative template that's fit into every single situation. A lot of stuff is not talked about in the Russia-Ukraine war. One of the things that's not talked about is, okay, so Putin is overthrown, then who do you think will come into power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things I talk about with Arestovych is that Putin, and he gets criticized for this, that Putin, out of all the people that might take power is the most liberal, is the most dovish. In fact, every indication shows that he really hates this war, and so everybody that will step in if he steps down or if he is overthrown is just going to accelerate this war and the expansionism and the thirst for empire and all that kind of stuff that the U.S military industrial complex will feed into. So you have to think about what the future holds and what the different power players are and what the level of corruption there is, and the realistic view of the situation versus the idealistic view of the situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just on that note real quick, I think that was exposed in broad daylight when it appeared that the former head of the Wagner Group was about to try to launch a coup, and how that was so celebrated, even on MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and others touting that this was somehow going to be a great thing, without looking at who is this guy really? What has he been doing in different countries around the world and what would be his ruling philosophy and how that would differ or benefit American interests or the interest of security and peace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also the interest of Ukraine or Russia, or humanity overall, just the flourishing of nations, which is great for everybody, and collaborations with nations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Friendly competition. One of the things I love about the 20th century is the friendly, sometimes not so friendly, competition between the Soviet Union and the United States in space, in the space race. That's created some incredible engineering and scientific breakthroughs and all of this, and also made people dream about reaching out to the stars, and war destroys all of that, or damages it. Hopefully just damages it. Hopefully the Phoenix will rise again. Well, let me ask you about the criticism you've mentioned. It's probably the most common criticism of you, that you love Putin. So just to linger on it, what do you think is the foundation of this criticism?<|eot_id|>"}

It's happened to Bobby Kennedy. It's happened to people like Rand Paul and others. There's a small group, but a growing number, at least I'm on the Republican side at this point, people who are actually willing to stand up and challenge the military industrial complex, challenge the warmongers in both parties.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, people on the left have challenged the warmongers as well throughout the last few decades.<|eot_id|>"}

And what we have seen is that's exactly what's happened, and people have retracted statements or just fallen silent or whatever the case may be. This debate that should be existent within both parties, on the Democrat side unfortunately, it just doesn't exist anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There seems to be some kind of mass hysteria over the war in Ukraine. It was strange to watch that the nuance aspect of the discussion was lost very quickly. It was, \"Putin bad.\" It was a war between good and evil.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, which is pretty sick when you think about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The cynical view is, of course, it's the military industrial complex machine, the war profiteers just driving this kind of conversation. I hope they don't have that much power. I hope they just have incentives and they push people and they use people's natural desire to divide the world into good and evil and fight for the side of good.

They've got a lot of tools to do that, which I think is why President Eisenhower chose to include this in his farewell address as a warning, because the only recourse, the only real power that has the ability to destroy them and stand up against them is a free people living in a free society, exercising the rights that we have enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just talked to Annie Jacobsen.

Even potentially with tactical nuclear weapons, that the machinery of it, how clueless everybody is combined with the machinery of it, it's just impossible to stop, and it's just between Russia and the United States especially. And then all of a sudden, you have nuclear winter and 5 billion people are dead, and they die through just essentially torture, slowly. How do we avoid that? How do we avoid a nuclear war? That's something that you talk about and think about. How do we avoid this kind of escalation of a hot war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a nuclear war occurring, whether it be an intentional attack, or as we saw during the last Cold War, one that could be launched unintentionally. How many near misses were there during the last Cold War? I saw this documentary called The Man Who Saved the World, and it was some mid-level officer who happened to be on duty and who didn't do what he was told in launching the nuclear missiles because of what they thought was an incoming attack, and it turned out to be a complete mistake or misread on the radar, but that's what we're facing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But by the way, there's so many things to say there, but one of the things that Annie Jacobsen details is just how organized the machinery of all of this is, where the humans involved don't have to think. They just follow orders. There's a very clear set of steps you take, and there's very few places where you can inject your humanity and be like, \"Wait a minute, what's the big picture of this?\" The only person that can think is the... That can think is the president of the United States. The president of the United States gets six minutes after the warning. The early warning system says, whether it's false or not, says that, \"We believe that there's been a nuclear weapon launched. You have six minutes before you can make the decision of launch back, initiate.\" And to me, that's what I'm voting based on, in the current situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You really have to see that as one of the most important aspects of the United States President, is, \"Who do you trust in those six minutes to sit there?\"<|eot_id|>"}

To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. \"A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. American makers of plowshares could with time and as required, make swords as well. But now, we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. This conjunction of immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
