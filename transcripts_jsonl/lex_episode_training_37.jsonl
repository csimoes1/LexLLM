Even potentially with tactical nuclear weapons, that the machinery of it, how clueless everybody is combined with the machinery of it, it's just impossible to stop, and it's just between Russia and the United States especially. And then all of a sudden, you have nuclear winter and 5 billion people are dead, and they die through just essentially torture, slowly. How do we avoid that? How do we avoid a nuclear war? That's something that you talk about and think about. How do we avoid this kind of escalation of a hot war?<|eot_id|>"}

They just follow orders. There's a very clear set of steps you take, and there's very few places where you can inject your humanity and be like, \"Wait a minute, what's the big picture of this?\" The only person that can think is the... That can think is the president of the United States. The president of the United States gets six minutes after the warning. The early warning system says, whether it's false or not, says that, \"We believe that there's been a nuclear weapon launched. You have six minutes before you can make the decision of launch back, initiate.\" And to me, that's what I'm voting based on, in the current situation.<|eot_id|>"}

Some aspect of that is just the psychology of being able to withstand their attacks that are there in the political game, and that can break people. You just don't want the headaches. So to withstand the attacks is tough, and something about his psychology allows for that. I mean, I guess a question for you also in your own psychology, you've been attacked quite a bit.

To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address. \"A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. American makers of plowshares could with time and as required, make swords as well. But now, we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. This conjunction of immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
