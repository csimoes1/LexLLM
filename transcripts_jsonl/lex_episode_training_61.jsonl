{"text": "<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Jared Kushner, former senior advisor to the President during the Donald Trump administration and author of Breaking History, A White House memoir. He's one of the most influential and effective presidential advisors in modern history, helping conduct negotiations with some of the most powerful leaders in the world and deliver results on trade, criminal justice reform, and historic progress towards peace in the Middle East. On Thursday, October 5th, we recorded conversation on topics of war and peace, history and power in the Middle East and beyond. This was about a day and a half before the Hamas attack on Israel, and then we felt we must sit down again on Monday, October 9th and add a discussion on the current situation. We open the podcast with a second newly recorded part. My heart goes out to everyone who has and is suffering in this war. I pray for your strength and for the long-term peace and flourishing of the Israeli and Palestinian people. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Jared Kushner. We did a lot of this conversation before the Hamas attack on Israel, and we decided to sit down again and finish the discussion to address the current situation which is still developing. If I may allow me to summarize the situation as it stands today, it's morning Monday, October 9th. On Saturday, October 7th at 6:30 AM Israel time, Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Southern Israel. The rocket attacks served as cover for a multi-pronged infiltration of Israel territory by over 1000 Hamas militants. This is shortly after at 7:40 AM. The Hamas militants went door to door in border towns killing civilians and taking captives, including women and children. In response to this, Israeli Air Force began carrying out strikes in Gaza, also fighting on the ground in Israel to clear out Hamas militants from Israel territory and preparing to mobilize Israeli troops for potential ground attack on Hamas and Gaza. Now, of course, this is what it appears to be right now, and this along with other things might change because the situation is still developing. The IDF is ordering civilian residents of Gaza to evacuate their homes for their safety. Benjamin Netanyahu declared war in several statements and warned Israelis to brace themselves for a long and difficult war. Just today, Israeli ministers ordered a \"complete siege of Gaza interrupting supplies of electricity, food, water, and fuel from Israel to Gaza.\" As of now, October 9th, the death toll is over 1200 people and over 130 hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas. As I said, the events are rapidly unfolding, so these numbers will sadly increase, but hopefully our words here can at least in part, speak to the timeless underlying currents of the history and as you write about the power dynamics of the region. For people who don't know, Gaza is a 25 miles long, six miles wide strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. It borders Israel on the east and north and Egypt on the southwest. It's densely populated, about 2.3 million people, and there's been a blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt since 2007 when Hamas took power. I could just summarize that Hamas is a Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. It originated in 1988, and it came to power in Gaza in 2006. As part of its charter, it's sworn to the destruction of Israel, and it is designated by the United States, European Union, UK, and of course Israel as a terrorist group. Given that context, what are your feelings as a human being and what is your analysis as the former senior advisor to the president under the Trump administration of the current situation in Israel and Gaza?<|eot_id|>"}

What conversations would you have?

Let's let the current situation play out and then hopefully there'll be a way for it to move forward.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just hope there's still people on the US side picking up the phone and calling UAE, Saudi Arabia just as human beings, as friends, as allies, and just keeping that channel of communication going. Maybe you can correct me, but I just feel like there's just simple human dynamics that play out here, that divisions can form and just run away from you. Over simple misunderstandings, over just inability to see a tragedy from the same perspective because of conversations that could have happened but didn't happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's actually what's most important. So communication, I hope for. But deepening and trusting relationships, that's what I believe makes progress and keeps people safe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We talk quite extensively about the value of trust in negotiation and just working with leaders, which I think is a fascinating conversation. And you've taught me a lot about that. Let me ask you about the end here. What are the various trajectories this war can take, in your view? What are some of the end states, as you've said, which are desirable and are achievable?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>complicating factors, but that's the end state that the global community should be looking to come together. And it's very achievable. It's very, very achievable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As we stand here today, there's a lot of different ways that this war can evolve. If a ground invasion happens, by Israeli forces, of Gaza, and if the number is correct of 100,000 Israeli soldiers.

And I do think that division definitely creates risk for countries.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me switch gears here and just zoom out and look at our society and our public discourse at the moment.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be secure and then having an opportunity for the Palestinian people to live a better life is the right pathway to try and pursue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you, there's a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people, in that Hamas is the enemy of progress and the flourishing of the Palestinian people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is, then maybe that brings more unity and understanding and we get to a conclusion better that could improve the lives of the Palestinian people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pragmatic question about the future.

It's a big honor to speak with you again. Every time I speak to you, I learn a lot about the world. And I deeply appreciate, like I said, your humility and your understanding of the details of all the complex power dynamics and human dynamics that are going on in the world. Once again, thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they should be safe and they should be really watched by God to accomplish whatever mission will enable to make the world a safer place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for listening to this newly-recorded segment of The Conversation that addresses the current situation in Israel and Gaza. And now we go on to the second part of the conversation recorded on Thursday, October 5th. Given your experience in negotiating with some of the most powerful and influential leaders in the world, what's the key to negotiating difficult agreements in geopolitics? I start with a big question.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And both of them, in a divided time of the Trump administration, were bipartisan wins with big, big votes in the Senate and the House.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a lot of stories of this kind, sometimes a soft approach, sometimes a hard approach. I think the story where with Bibi, there was a potential, a dramatic election coming up, and you have to say, \"No. No excuses, no delaying. We have to make this agreement.\" I know Bibi cares about Israel more than the particular dynamics of the election. You had to draw a hard line there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>assume that people were acting mostly in good faith, you were able to navigate areas where you didn't have complete overlap of priorities and objectives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to go back to the trust thing, you sometimes see that with leaders, where it looks like they're trying to screw over the other person when they're talking. And so, not having that, I think is a really powerful thing for earning trust. That people actually can believe that you're results driven and are working towards a certain end. Is there a skill to that? Is that genetics, you're born with that? Or is that something you develop? So basically, it requires you to look at the game of politics and not have a kind of cynicism about it, to where everybody's trying to manipulate you. And actually just go in with a kind open mind and open heart and actually speak truthfully to people on a basic human level.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I act in a way where I could be the type of partner or friend to others that I wish others would be to me?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you look for a good partner, don't you think there's the capacity for both good and bad in every person? So when you negotiate with all of these leaders, aren't there multiple people you're speaking to inside one person, that you're trying to encourage, catalyze the goodness in the human?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to find areas where you have common interests and then work well together to pursue those common interests in order to achieve a certain goal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, you're incredibly well-read. I've gotten to know you and I've gotten to know Ivanka, and the book recommendation list is just incredible. So first of all, thank you for that. You told me about The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman. It's a book on World War I, and I went down a whole rabbit hole there. She's an incredible historian. But anyway, there's a bunch of stuff you learned from that, but one of the things you told me is it influenced your general approach to diplomacy of just picking up the phone and giving it a try. So as opposed to planning and strategizing, just pick up the phone.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>getting calls from friends at the time saying, \"I'm trying to go to Hawaii for vacation. Should I not be going? Is it not safe?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>where people want to play it safe, which is not the notion that really was taken during the time that President Trump was in office.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it has to be that way? I think there's something in the human spirit, in the public that desires politicians to take on the big, bold problems. Right? Why is it the politicians need to be so afraid of failure?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is there, they would stab you in the eye, in DC they would stab you in the back, and it just became a whole different-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>God line.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be if you have the right people in power who are willing to take on the right challenges and do it in the right way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if we just linger on the North Korea and the deescalation and the meeting, what's the trajectory from this could be the most catastrophic thing that destroys the world, to you find back channels? Do you start talking and start arranging the meeting? Is there some insights you can give to how difficult that is to do? In that, in the North Korea case, which seems like to be one of the more closed off parts of the world. And any other cases that you worked on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>move things forward. And again, I think that there's a lot of possibility there for what could happen if it's worked in the right way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just want to know how you word that first email or text message, what emojis do you use? Like the hugging emoji. It's just personally, I've gotten to know a lot of powerful and rich people, and it's funny that they're all human, just like you're saying. And a lot of the drama, a lot of the problems can be resolved with just a little comradery, a little kindness, a little just actually just reaching out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be successful, and people want to be good. And you're right too. There's way more emojis involved in diplomacy than I ever would've expected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And every leader, I'm sure, has their favorite emoji. This is also I learned about people. Everybody has their go-to emoji. I usually go to the heart very quickly, emoji. There's some people who go the hugging, whatever that, you're like the hugging thing. Anyway. This conversation quickly turned to the ridiculous. But to do another book reference, you mentioned the book Thirteen Days in September by Lawrence Wright, in discussing all the work you've done in Israel and the Middle East. I just want to ask you sort of the interesting aspect of that book, which is the influence of the personalities and personal relationships on these negotiations. You kind of started to allude to that with the trust, but how much do the personalities matter in this? So going from North Korea to the Middle East here, to within Congress and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it. A very entertaining read and something that at least gave me encouragement to keep going when the task I was pursuing seemed so large.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you could just linger on the personalities. You write in the book that words matter. Or you write in the context of saying, in the diplomacy business, words matter. And then you said that, \"We're in the results business,\" is a badass line. But if we just stick to the diplomacy business and words mattering, it seems like one of the things you really highlight that individual words can really have... You can fight over individual words. So how do you operate in a world where single words matter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's a different kind of notion. And it was just understanding the mentality and trying to adjust and bridging the divides between the different trainings.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that the biggest thing you took from your business background, is that just be really results focused?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of opportunity with our government, of people with more business mindsets who are going to think about things from a solutions perspective, go and serve.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that one of the main problems here? So you also mentioned the book, the Great Degeneration by Niall Ferguson, an awesome historian. He's been on this podcast. It helped you understand the inefficiencies of government regulation. I'd love it if you can give an insight into why government is so inefficient at times. When it is inefficient, when it doesn't work, why is that the case? The bureaucracy that you spoke to, the negative aspects of the bureaucracy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>different actions you take? And often, government gets it wrong by taking an action that feels right, but has big negative consequences down the road.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's go to some difficult topics. You've wrote in the book about your experience with some very low points in government. You've been attacked quite a bit. One of the ones that stands out is the accusations of collusion with Russia. And you tell in the book, in general, this whole story, this whole journey, on a personal level, on a sort of big political level. Can you tell me some aspects of this story?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to kind of stay focused on the objectives and the policies. But it was a crazy time, and I learned a lot from that experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's crazy how just an accusation can be viral and can just go. One of the things that worries me is the effect on your mind, the psychology of it, to make sure it doesn't make you cynical. People that are trying to do stuff, those kinds of stories that can destroy their mind. So one of the things I'd love to sort of understand, you, who kind of rolled in from the business world, and all of a sudden, the entire world, from CNN to everybody's accusing you of colluding with the Russians. When you're sitting at home, how do you keep a calm mind, a clear mind, an optimistic one, that doesn't become cynical and actually just keep trying to push on and do stuff in the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>through it, it's good. So it's in the past and then I started moving to the future and that's really where I spent my time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But I want to linger on it because to me, that has a really discouraging effect on anyone who's trying to do positive in the world. These kinds of attacks are intense. You say one of the lessons you learned is that you really have to be perfect, but I hate that to be the lesson. I feel like you should be able to do stupid stuff, take big risks, and people celebrate the big risks and not try to weave gigantic stories over nothing. I just want to understand the two aspects of this, how to not have such stories of so much legs, and the other is how to stay psychologically strong? So you waved it off that you didn't have a fact problem, but it can just have a effect in your psyche. You seem to be pretty stoic about the whole thing, but just on the psychology side, how did you stay calm and not become cynical where you can continue to do stuff and take big risks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I didn't have a choice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you mean?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to people who are in tough situations. And I tried to just get tougher and I tried to just get better and work through it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You said that you and Ivanka, this intense time brought you two together and helped you deal with the intensity, with the chaos of it all.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and knowing that you had somebody who loved you and believed in you. I think that was definitely by far the biggest of anything. And-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Love is the answer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>right and she has a very strong moral compass. And I feel very lucky to have her as a partner. And I respect her tremendously.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. She walks through the fire with grace, I would say. And she's recommended a bunch of amazing books to me and she has an incredible, fascinating mind. But one thing that jumped out to me is you both love diners, Jersey diners. So I lived in Philly for a while and I traveled quite a bit and traveling from Boston down to Philly, maybe to DC, you can drive through Jersey. It's something about Jersey. I don't know what it is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the best. It's the best.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You listen to Bruce Springsteen. Louis C.K has this bit where I think it's part of criticizing cell phones today where people are too much on their phone. They don't just sit there, be bored, but he uses that story to tell where he's just driving and Bruce Springsteen's song comes on and he just wants to pull over to the side of the road and just weep for unexplainable reason. I think that's true because life is difficult. Life is full of suffering or struggle or challenges. So sometimes, it's always Bruce Springsteen, but some song like this can really make you reflect on life, that melancholy feeling. But that melancholy feeling is the other side of the happiness coin where, if you just allow yourself to feel that pain, you can also feel the highest joys. That's the sort of the point Louis C.K makes. And there's something about Jersey with the diners, often late at night... There's several diner experiences I should say. There's the family friendly, there's a nice waitress and there's a sweetness, a kindness like hello sweetheart, that kind of thing. There's also the 3:00 AM diner, the ones that are open 24 hours, that has a romantic element when you're a young man or young woman, you're traveling. The loneliness of that, it's all of it. The American diner is from Jack Kerouac on, represents something. I'm not sure what that is, but it's a real beautiful experience. And the food itself too.<|eot_id|>"}

You sent me a great essay from Paul Graham. I'm a big fan of. I think it explains a lot of your success. The essay is called How to Do Great Work, and people should go definitely read the full essay. There's a few things I could read from it, some quotes. \"Having new ideas is a strange game because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before? Seeing something obvious sounds easy, and yet empirically having new ideas is hard.\" The steps you took seem trivial, and yet nobody was taking them, or at least in the past, that weren't successful. So the successes you've had were as simple as essentially picking up the phone or trying. There's a lot of interesting things here to talk about. This aspect of doing this seemingly simple that seems to be so hard to do it, as Paul describes, requires a willingness to break rules. \" There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them and to be indifferent to them.\" That's an interesting distinction. \"I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent minded.\" So again, that's to enjoy breaking the rules or being indifferent to the rules. \"The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person delight at the sheer of audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started. The other way to break the rules is not to care about them at all, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field,\" ignorance may be in quotes, \"of a field's assumptions act as a source of temporary, passive, independent mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.\" So the aggressive and the passive is such an interesting way of looking at it. Perhaps some aspect of this, at least in the story you told us, some passive aspect where you're not even acknowledging, not even caring that there was rules, just kind of asking the simple question and taking the simple action.<|eot_id|>"}

You've worked with this in the Middle East with Israel and so on, how the history, the narratives, the stories, they kind of have this momentum that's so hard to break even when you have new leaders, new blood, new ideas that come in. It's just sad to see that yes, this tragedy happens, but it doesn't mean that you can't make progress. I don't know if you have lessons from that, just how much of a dramatic impact it had on creating tension between the United States and Saudi and in general and the Middle East that somehow Saudi's not a friend, but is against the ideals and the values of the United States.<|eot_id|>"}

And that's what Abraham, of course, took big leaps on. Okay, so we'll talk about that a little bit more, but that's kind of a religious component. That's a dignity in the religious practice and faith component. But then the other thing you mentioned so simply, which is you have money flow past the leadership ranks.

You can start integrating, traveling, communicating, doing business with, socializing. So the cultures mix, conversations mix, all of this.
