Perhaps summarization not down to a single scale of value, but looking at that whole sea of numbers, you have to find patterns like what is inflation in a particular sector? What does it maybe change over time, maybe different geographical regions, things of that nature. I think that's, I don't know even what that task is. That's what you could look at machine learning, you can look at AI with that perspective, which is how do you represent what's happening efficiently, as efficiently as possible?

The formal CPI announced a 7.9%. You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket, a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer.

And because things have collapsed into the iPhone, you just don't need as much space. So now it may be that the apartment costs 50% more, but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power.<|eot_id|>"}

They cost nothing, and there is no inflation, but you don't get your concerts right? So the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket, but in my opinion, that's not the biggest problem.

If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you ask the question, \"How fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year?\" Generally about two to 3%, the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a two and a half, 3% improvement a year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As measured by GDP.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>10% return on a billion dollars investment, paying 3% interest, is that fair? And who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment where you're just inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant, it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply, and the difference in asset appreciation is going to be a function of the scarce, desirable quality of the assets, and to what extent can I make more of them, and to what extent are they truly limited in supply?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So we will get to a lot of the words you said there, the scarcity and so connected to how limited they are and the value of those assets.

The expansion of the money supply, just to put some terms on the table so we understand them. You nonchalantly say it's always on average expanding every year.

And how you perceive the world is the question of at what frequency do you want to perceive the world? And I think that once you start to think that way, you're catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like and why would I want it? And what is it? So why don't we just start right there. What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin. Bitcoin's a crypto asset. It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we just linger on that? Bitcoin is digital asset that has monetary value.

And it doesn't matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your barrel of oil, they cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood. And so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why use the word ethical? And sorry, I may interrupt occasionally.

That's a really critical characteristic. And it actually is, it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special. Bitcoin isn't just a crypto-asset network. It's easy to create a crypto-asset network. It's very hard to create an ethical crypto-asset network because you have to create one without any government or corporation or investor exercising into influence to make it successful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So open, permissionless, noncensorable. So basically no way for you without explicitly saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else. So it's a kind of, you have full control. Even with a barrel of oil, what's the difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you? Because you kind of mentioned that both are property. You mentioned Russia and China and so on. Is it the ability of the government to confiscate? In the end, governments can probably confiscate no matter what the asset is, but you want to lessen the effort involved.<|eot_id|>"}

It will never be trusted by the rest of the world, and legally it's impractical. But would you really want to put a hundred trillion dollars worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there's a board of directors and a CEO that could just get up and take half of it tomorrow? The answer is no. So, if you want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a digital property, and I'm using property here-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Open, permissionless, [inaudible 01:54:30]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the legal sense, but I would also go to the next step and say property is low frequency money. So, if I give you a million dollars and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it and the house is low frequency money. You converted the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house. Maybe after a decade you might convert it back into energy. You might sell the house for currency and it'll be worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate you sell in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The frequency means what here?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and every scan on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all these things, they're all digital something, but they're securities, right? Shares of stock are securities. Whenever anybody transfers, when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you're transferring in essence, a security or an IOU. So, transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the internet domain or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing. And anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that. But what they can't do, what 99% of them fail to do is be property. They're securities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore a little further. For example, what about when you... Like Coinbase or something like that, when there's an exchange that you buy Bitcoin in, you start to move away from this kind of, some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this noncensorable and permissionless and open. So, in order to achieve the convenience, the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these [inaudible 01:58:10] that remove the aspects of property. So, maybe you can comment on that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>key there is the foundational asset needs to be there at all. The fact that you can create a hundred trillion dollars layer one that would stand for a hundred years, that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time. And the fact that it's ethical, right? It's ethical and it's common property, global, permissionless. Extremely unlikely that would happen. People tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after, and they've all been... They've all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful. But for the most part, that's an extraordinary thing. Now-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just really quickly pause, just to define some terms. If maybe people don't know, layer one that Michael's referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally defined. Which is there's blockchain, there's a consensus mechanism of proof of work, low number of transactions, but you can move a very large amount of money. The reason he's using the term layer one is now that there's a lot of ideas of layer two technologies that built on top of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions, sort of higher frequency, I don't know how would terminology want to use, but basically be able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer, to transfer money, to use it as currency. Just to define some terms.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy, and we don't want it to move fast. What we want is immortality. Immortal, incorruptible, indestructible. That's what you want, integrity from the layer one. Now there's layer two and layer three and layer two I would define as an open, permissionless, non-custodial protocol that uses the underlying layer one token as its gas fee.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, what's custodial mean and how does the different markets... Like is Lightning network-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies. Now, that's not the end all, be all because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won't be the only one. There's an open market competition of other permissionless, open source protocols to do this work. And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property, deemed to be non-security, you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin. There's a debate about are there any and what are they? And we could leave that for a later time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But why do you think of them as layer two as opposed to contending for layer one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token, then they are a layer one. If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee, then it becomes a layer two. Bitcoin itself incentivizes its own transactions with its own token, and that's what makes it layer one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, what's layer three then?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Layer three is a custodial layer. So, if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free, you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App. This is a very straightforward thing. I mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands of layer threes. There may be dozens of layer twos. I mean, Lightning is a one, but it's not the only one, anybody can invent something. And we can have this debate about custodial, non-custodial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Don't you think there's a monopolization possibilities at layer three. You mentioned Binance, Coinbase. What if they start to dominate and basically everybody's using them practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to memorize the private key in your brain or like a cold storage of layer one technology.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you want to. A layer four would be, I've got Bitcoin on an application, but I can't withdraw it. So, I've got an application that's backed by Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin is sealed. It's a proprietary example, and I'll give you an example of that. That would be like Grayscale. If I own a share of GBTC, so I own a security. Actually, you could own MSTR. If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits of Bitcoin, but you don't have the ability to withdraw the asset.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To get on the security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it. So, Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange. If you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of stock with Fidelity, and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity, and if you own some mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things can be removed from the custodian. But the Bitcoin, you can take off the exchange, you can remove from the custodian.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's still possible though-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a deterrent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>companies and no nation states, which is just not very practical, not anytime soon. Once you allow that nation states will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows, and the free market determines who wins. For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin. There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it, and they don't get the same market share, but they might give you some other advantage. There are certain layer threes, like Jack Dorsey's Cash App where they just incorporated Lightning, an implementation of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Into Cash App?<|eot_id|>"}

You get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because you wouldn't be able to implement a system that interfaced with somebody else's system if it's not in the right political jurisdiction. On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would trade in this Lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody's permission. So, you're talking about something that's like a million times cheaper, less friction, and faster to do it if you want to get money to move.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think that looks like? So, now there's a war going on in Ukraine. There's other wars, Yemen, going on throughout the world.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, Bitcoin is a universal trust protocol. A universal energy protocol, if you will. English is one.

What is the revolutionary act here when you don't agree with the government or what you want to free yourself from the... So here's the thing. When a nation is really at war, especially if it's an authoritarian regime, it's going to try to control the pipe, lock everything down, the spread of information. How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build another app essentially that allows you to flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government? So basically break the law, is that possible?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English. For example, it's not illegal to speak English. Even if it is, does it matter? But English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it, and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network. So Bitcoin is a language. So you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak Lightning, and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the problem is it's still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now during war.

Cash App just implemented the first implementation, but not all the features are built into it. There's a few dozen, a dozen Lightning wallets circulating out there. So I think that we're probably going to be 36 months of software development. At the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts, that's a big deal. If Apple embraced Lightning, that's a big deal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the adoption is the thing...

If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second. So he's one of the early adopters or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption, this layer three, so inside Cash App. What do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner, as somebody playing in the space?

And what he's doing is to support both those areas. He's supporting the Bitcoin and the Lightning protocol by building them into his products, but he's also building the applications which you need at the Cash App level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality and the compliance necessary, and they're related.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I should also say he's just a fascinating person for a random reason that I couldn't even explain if I tried.

And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what you're calling digital energy to see how social networks, something I'm really interested in and passionate about, could be transformed. Let me ask you, just for educational purposes. Can you please explain to me what Web3 and the beef between Jack and Mark Andreessen is exactly? Did you see what happened?

It should be sold to the public pursuant to disclosures and regulations, and you're just ducking the IPO process. Right? And so now we get back to the ethical issue. Well, the ethical issue is if you're trading it as a commodity and representing it as a commodity, while truthfully it's a security, then it's a violation of ethics rules and it's probably illegal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you keep leaning on this.

I think there's a lot of correlation as you've discussed, but I'd like to leave the line aside. If the law calls something a security, it doesn't mean in my eyes that it is unethical. There could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time.

So you've had a heck of a life, you've done quite a lot of things, start before MIT, but starting with MIT, is there advice you have for young people, in high school and college, how to have a career that can be proud of, how to have a life they can be proud of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children. He had twins, when they enter adulthood. He said, \"Give me your advice for them,\" in a letter. \"I'm going to give it to them when they turn 21,\" or something. I was at a party and then he handed me this sheet of paper, and I thought, \"Oh, he wants me to write it down right now.\" So I sat down, I started writing and I figured, \"Well, what would you want to tell someone at age 21?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote it down.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I wrote it down. Then I tweeted it and it's sitting on Twitter. But I tell you what I said. I said, \"My advice, if you're entering adulthood, focus your energy, guard your time, train your mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends, curate your environment, keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world.\" That was the 10.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Upgrade the world.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can sit and watch chess videos a hundred hours a week and you'll never get through all the chess videos. There's too much of every possible thing, too much of every good thing. So figuring out what you want to do, and then... Everything will suck up your time. There's a hundred streaming channels to binge-watch on. You got to guard your time and then train your body, train your mind, and control who's around you, control what surrounds you. So ultimately, in a world where there's too much of everything, then your success-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's like those laser eyes, you have to focus on just a few of those things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I got a thousand opinions we could talk about, and I could pursue a thousand things, but I don't expect to be successful. I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more valid than the leader of thought in that area. So how about if I just focus upon one thing and then deliver the best I can in the one thing. That's the laser eye message. The rest get you distracted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you achieve that?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So everything about you just radiates that, people know. People know this is-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If they know what you're focused on, then you won't get so many other things coming your way.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert and to focus on in one area. It's punishing generalists, jack-of-all-trades, especially people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you're a specialist in the digital realm, you might very well... You're the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter and you show them how to tie knots, or you're the banjo player with 1.8 million followers, and when everybody types banjo, it's you, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they're capable of or have made... I guess to get a PhD, technically you have to have done a dissertation where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. And if you haven't done that, technically you have a master's degree, but you're not a doctor. So if you're interested in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists... you know the Agadmator?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Agadmator on YouTube. He's the world's greatest chess commentator.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've watched his career, and he's got progressively better, and he's really good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's going to love hearing this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>problem is, back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment, the problem is if it is possible to be automated, then over time, someone's probably going to automate it, that squeezes the state space of everybody else. Like after the lockdowns, it used to be there are all these local bands that played in bars and everybody went to the bar to see the local band, and then during the lockdown, you would have these six super groups, and they would all get 500,000 or a million followers, and all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, the interesting thing is one of those 500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of the automation. So it's an opportunity for you to think, \"Where's my field, my discipline, evolving into?\" I talked to a bunch of librarians, just happen to be friends with librarians. Libraries will probably be evolving, and it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.<|eot_id|>"}

And I think the algorithm, right? The Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithm, they really reward the person that's focused on message, consistent. The world wants somebody they can trust that's consistent and reliable, and they kind of want to know what they're getting into, because, and this is taken for granted maybe, but there's 10 million people vying for every hour of your time.

And you should be thanking them and you should respect their time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting. Everything you said is very interesting. But of course, from my perspective and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with, it's just being focused on stuff. In my case, it's like focus on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself, and not caring about anything else. I don't care about views or likes or attention. And that just maintaining that focus is the way, from an individual perspective, you live that life. But yeah, it does seem that the world and technology is rewarding the specialization and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And then that lifts all boats actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to do specific things, and they educate themselves. Just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable and more and more empowered.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The reward for authenticity more than offsets the specificity with which you pursue your mission.

Speaking of deep thinking, you're just a human. Your life ends. You've accumulated so much wisdom, so much money, but the ride ends. Do you think about that? Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation, and the foundation's mission is to make education free for everybody forever.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of immortal life yet. That's a biological question. And you asked that on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on the threshold of immortal life for ideas or immortal life for certain institutions or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected endowment. And then the question really is what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind? And so if it's a park, then you endow the park, right? If it's free education, you endow that. If it's some other ethical idea, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does it make you sad that there's something that you've endowed, some very powerful idea of digital energy that you put out into, you help put it into the world, and that your mind, your conscious mind, will no longer be there to experience it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>us is you should do your part during some phase of the journey, and then you should get out of the way. I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very famous speech one day, which is \"Death is a natural part of life and it makes way for the next generation.\" And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, bad things happen. I think nature cleanses itself. There's a cycle of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington. So hopefully when you get out of the way, nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you. What do you think, to do a bit of a callback, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization. It seems like we're engineers at heart. We build cool stuff, better and better use of energy, channeling energy to be productive. Why? What's it all for?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're getting metaphysical on me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Very.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>entertain yourself by creating something that's both beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things, it's entertaining, but it's ethical. You got to admire the first person that built a bridge, crossing a chasm, or the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village, or the first person to figure out how to dam up a river, or mastered agriculture, or the guy that figured out how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards, and maybe one day had 10 fruit trees. He is pretty proud of himself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's functional. There is also something to that, just like you said, that's just beautiful. It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. Something... When you step back and look at the entirety of it. A collective of humans, using a beautiful invention or creation, or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music, that seems just right. That's what we're here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that. And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective, the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Isn't there something beautiful about making the world a better place for people that you love, your friends, your family, or yourself?

You got to respect that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a heck of a gift they gave us. It's also a heck of a responsibility. Don't screw it up.<|eot_id|>"}
