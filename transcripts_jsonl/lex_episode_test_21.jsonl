While he does make fun of himself a lot, he is legitimately one of the greatest submission grapplers in the world. Underneath the veil of nonstop sexualized Aussie humor and incessant online trolling, he is truly a kindhearted human being who's trying to do good in the world. Sometimes he does so through a bit of controversy and chaos. Like with a new CJI tournament that has over $2 million in prize money. It's coming up this Friday and Saturday. Yes, the same weekend as the prestigious ADCC tournament. The goal of CGI tournament is to grow the sport. You'll be able to watch it for free online, live on YouTube and other places. All ticket profits go to charity, mainly to cancer research. I encourage you to support the mission of this tournament by buying tickets and going to see the event in person. Craig gave me a special link that gives you a 50% discount on the tickets. Go to lexfreeman.com/cji and it should forward you to the right place. They're trying to sell the last few tickets now. It's a good cause. Go buy some. Also let me say, as a fan of the sport, I highly encourage you to watch both CJI and ADCC. To celebrate athletes competing in both. From CJI with Nicky Ryan, Nicky Rod, or Ruotolo Brothers, Ffion Davis, McKenzie Dern, and more. To ADCC with Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Meregali, Giancarlo Bodoni, Rafael Lovato, Jr., Mica Galvao, and more. I have a lot of respect for everyone involved. I trained with many of them regularly and consider many of them friends. Including Craig Gordon and of course John Danaher, who I will talk to many, many more times on this podcast. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, I invite you all to come to the pool with Craig Jones and me.

But to me, increasingly terrifying notion is of them becoming autonomous. It's the best way to defend against the drone that's FPV controlled is for AI to be controlling that drone. Just have swarms of drones that are $500 controlled by AI systems. That's a terrifying possibility that the future of warfare is essentially swarms of drones on both sides. Then maybe swarms of drones, say between US and China over Taiwan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be wild. They do those crazy drone light shows where they do those performances with the lights and stuff.

The low level control, flight control of those is done autonomously. But there's a interface for doing the choreography that's hard coded in. But adding increasing levels of intelligence to the drone where you can detect another drone, follow it and defend yourself. In terms of the military on both sides as the Ukraine war, that's the technology, that's like the most wanted technology is drone defense. How are you defending as drones on both sides? Anybody that comes up with an autonomous drone technology is going to help whichever side uses that technology to gain a mill- ... is going to help whichever side uses that technology to gain a military advantage. And so, there's a huge incentive to build that technology but then, of course, once both sides started using that technology, then there's swarms of autonomous drones who don't give a shit about humans, just killing everything in sight on both sides. And that's terrifying because there's civilian deaths that are possible that are terrifying, especially when you look 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now.<|eot_id|>"}

So, if you want to do a public speaking thing and doing it outside, you're in danger because it's very difficult to detect those drones, it could be anywhere.

That's what bothers me about the IOC with the Olympics is that there's this organization that puts on an incredible event, but it's completely opaque, it's not transparent and the athletes don't get paid almost at all. So, it's usually from sponsorships and they sell distribution, broadcast distribution. And so, it's mostly pay walled after the fact. It's very... Unless you're a super famous athlete or a famous event, it's hard to watch. I don't know the early rounds of the weightlifting or the judo or all of the competitions where most of those athletes get paid almost nothing and they've dedicated their whole life like, they've sacrificed everything to be there and we don't get to watch them openly. And in many cases, you can't even pay for it. With IOC, I've got to experience this because I'll have podcast conversations with judoka for example, and I put a little clip in a podcast and the Olympics channel takes it down immediately.

But in the case of the Olympics, first of all, in the case of the Olympics, the whole point of the Olympics is for it to be accessible to everybody. So, paywalling goes against the spirit of the Olympic Games. And I will say the same is probably true for many sports I grappling, especially from major events like ADCC that I feel like they should be openly accessible to everybody on every platform.
