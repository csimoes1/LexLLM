{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That you can still make fun of anything as long as it's funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Craig Jones, martial artist, world traveler and one of the funniest people in the sport of submission grappling. While he does make fun of himself a lot, he is legitimately one of the greatest submission grapplers in the world. Underneath the veil of nonstop sexualized Aussie humor and incessant online trolling, he is truly a kindhearted human being who's trying to do good in the world. Sometimes he does so through a bit of controversy and chaos. Like with a new CJI tournament that has over $2 million in prize money. It's coming up this Friday and Saturday. Yes, the same weekend as the prestigious ADCC tournament. The goal of CGI tournament is to grow the sport. You'll be able to watch it for free online, live on YouTube and other places. All ticket profits go to charity, mainly to cancer research. I encourage you to support the mission of this tournament by buying tickets and going to see the event in person. Craig gave me a special link that gives you a 50% discount on the tickets. Go to lexfreeman.com/cji and it should forward you to the right place. They're trying to sell the last few tickets now. It's a good cause. Go buy some. Also let me say, as a fan of the sport, I highly encourage you to watch both CJI and ADCC. To celebrate athletes competing in both. From CJI with Nicky Ryan, Nicky Rod, or Ruotolo Brothers, Ffion Davis, McKenzie Dern, and more. To ADCC with Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Meregali, Giancarlo Bodoni, Rafael Lovato, Jr., Mica Galvao, and more. I have a lot of respect for everyone involved. I trained with many of them regularly and consider many of them friends. Including Craig Gordon and of course John Danaher, who I will talk to many, many more times on this podcast. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, I invite you all to come to the pool with Craig Jones and me.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we we're going to wing it. I was told not to tell anyone, but I sent pictures of it to everyone I know.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it was a company that sponsors me, shuffle.com. It was their friend. A friend of theirs, so a guy that's never met me before just took the risk to show up to a stranger's house with a million dollars in cash to bring to Joe Rogan.

In Kazakhstan, we did some things that were dangerous. If the locals are like, come along, join in on this activity, I feel personally obligated to go with them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not about the risk.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We're in Kazakhstan. We're doing some filming in Kazakhstan, and obviously Borats still a very traumatic memory for them, and some of my jokes felt like they don't go as well in that neck of the woods.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of horse riders came at me. I was quite concerned at that point because they're bashing into each other and obviously they're angry. They're seeing a foreigner in there. I was wearing basically Biggie Smalls COOGI looking sweater, so I stood out. They definitely didn't like that I was participating in a game that they probably trained their whole life for and that amount of money they could win is very, very significant and there's me in there. They're also pointing out Borat, Borat. Thinking I was making Borat jokes, which again, very traumatic memory for the people at Kazakhstan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Were you making Borat jokes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, but I guess it's the same type of humor. I'm not pretending to be Kazak.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he made a comment on there.

I think we were at the closest 0.7 kilometers from the front line. Obviously very surreal experience to be over there seeing basically how the battles fought with those drones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How long ago was this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>defense tracker. At any time there could be an air siren going off, an air alert on your phone. Could be like drones heading your way, planes are in the air, missiles flying. Then those missiles will change direction and stuff, so the air alert, you don't know if it's heading a different direction, but they just warn everyone. You live under a constant state of fear basically. Then on that first trip, the heaviest moment was, I was going downstairs in the hotel to work out, which is honestly a rare thing these days, doing something healthy with myself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're working out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Getting in the gym, pumping some iron. This was divine intervention that a hypersonic missile was shot down by the patriot event system, just like five minutes from the hotel. The whole hotel and the attached gym just shook like crazy. Some people started freaking out. Most people went to leave to go outside, which I don't think is recommended, but you want to see what's going on out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This was in Kyiv?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>took me to the site of where just part of the missile had landed in the ground and left this huge of indentation. They'd already cleared up most of the, I guess, shrapnel from the missile. I don't know if I should or if I was legally allowed to do this, but I took some of that missile back home with me. I don't know where I left it actually. But I thought maybe that would raise some alarm bells and airport scans. But I took it regardless. That was basically the crazy thing that happened on that first trip.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The Patriot Defense System is incredible. That's an incredible piece of technology that's from the United States. It's expensive but it's incredible. Then so that's protecting Kjiv.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thinking, look at what it shot out the sky. Imagine if they didn't have that. But that was probably the most surreal moment. But Kjiv largely, life goes on most of the time as per normal. I was faced with crazy messages and comments, even just posting that video. Like I'm getting paid by Ukraine and stuff. It's just like people just don't understand that life has to go on like Kjiv here, the front lines far away. The cities have to largely try to operate as normal or just life will not go on in those villages and cities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's human nature as well. It's not just Kjiv, it's Kharkiv, it's even Donetsk, Khartsyzk. People get accustomed to war quickly. It's impossible to suffer for prolonged periods of time, so you adjust and you appreciate the things you still have.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>arrest. Rightfully so. Really have no business going to Chernobyl. We made a connection. I won't say who this connection was, but he had heard about what I had done with a charity event and opened some doors for us to be able to go to Chernobyl. We got to see Chernobyl. We had some filming restrictions there just because it was a crazy military conflict at one point. We got to actually see Chernobyl. Chernobyl always been a dream of mine to see. It's just such an interesting place and to see it under these conditions, very, very strange.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, what was that like? There's no civilians there now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's just completely empty. I guess it's like the fantasy you have. I imagine people go on tours of Chernobyl back in the tourist days when it was a tourist spot and it would be busy full of tourists. We got basically a private tour, so we got to really feel that abandoned vibes. I guess I was interested in it from playing Call of Duty and then Chernobyl series, all the documentaries and stuff. But very, very strange place to go visit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is now a minefield like a lot of parts of Ukraine. That's one of the dark, terrifying aspects of wars. How many mines are left even when the war ends for decades after? Mines everywhere. Because de-mining is extremely difficult and that could continually kill people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think it'll be a tourist spot for a very long time. Because if you were thinking about areas to de-mine when the conflict ends, an area where if you accidentally trigger a mine could cause a radiation leak. It's probably going to be very low on the list. Tourism for Chernobyl, who knows how long until that returns.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think you were able to get to Chernobyl? Why don't you think the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian soldiers don't see you as a threat?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe they were hoping that I did step on a mine. Maybe my jokes didn't go too well there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your connection was actually Putin, he was trying to get rid of you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Putin, yeah. I don't know. We felt pretty safe when we're there. There was an air alert went off. They were more concerned with me dying just for the PR side of things. It's like Australian tourist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In one of your videos actually heard Ukrainian language. They were talking about, we don't want to lose an athlete. That's what they're saying as they're loading the rocket launcher.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, the rocket launcher. I showed a rocket launcher with the troops on the first trip. But the second trip I went back to, which was only maybe four to five weeks ago. This time we went to some crazier spots. We went to Odessa, which has been hit a ton.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I really enjoyed the video of old man stretching and exercising on the Odessa shore.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, what is it, a local custom?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Odessa people are known historically to be wild.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was wild. It was abrasive to the eyes, but I appreciated it. Especially a middle-aged man in underwear with a beer belly doing a Sundance at dusk. That would frighten many people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The battleship would turn around. Yeah, so where else?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>point. Then we basically raced back. But I started to realize we were in danger at any point where he really sped the car up or took evasive movements in the car. But we got out of there and I think I had someone translate it later and basically he was checking to see if the roads were clear for us to leave. Ultimately ended up being someone died and a few people injured from that blast, which was less than half a kilometer from us. Basically they were radioing saying, end the tour, come back to the police station.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Artillery is terrifying. There's just shelling and it's the destructive power of artillery is insane.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's constant all the time. You hear that noise and you're like, is that coming or going? Very concerning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. You don't know. You don't know. Just like that, it could be you, gone.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it was the day we left. We stayed there overnight. The day we left, it just started getting extremely shelled and the soldier we were with just took a selfie video of us and basically the location we were in just hearing just artillery strike after artillery strike, just being like, oh, you guys left and the fun began. They take it in good spirit. I was trying to use their energy to reassure myself. But I guess when they see it every day, they're more adjusted to it. They're not freaking out every time something crazy that goes on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, they have to. They have to be in good spirit. You have to be joking and laughing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The guys are always laughing and joking. They were laughing and joking at me quite a bit, holding weapons, trying to shoot weapons and stuff. They got a lot of enjoyment out of me shooting the RPG.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they're probably still telling stories of that crazy Australian American that rolled in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They helped me out though in my marketing campaign for the tournament. We were able to secure a Lada, classic Soviet Union car. We towed it, we painted it with the logos of the other event, the ADCC, and we got to shoot some RPGs at it. Great experience. Great fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's a very creative marketing campaign.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Very dangerous one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't think Coke or Pepsi are going to do that one. It's very innovative.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>under the car, so it was risky. That could have gone off at any moment. But we needed to get it to ignite. We needed to get a shot where it was on fire. The logo of the enemy tournament was basically on fire. We poured gasoline on it. We shot the gasoline tank. That didn't work. That must be a movie trick or something. Then we decided we had light on fire, a rag and just throw it into the blown out back window. I'm with this guy, special forces guy, and we throw the rag in the back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like soaked in gasoline rag?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>very, very close to us over our head. One landed right by my leg. We're like, \"Shit, we better get out of here.\" Obviously not much safety concerns at that point, but we survived basically artillery strikes. We survived a bit of friendly fire with the bullets coming our way. But again, I was strangely calm because the other guys were calm. But then afterwards they said to me, they were like, \"oh bro, if you got shot, we'd just have to dump your body at a hospital. We wouldn't be able to explain why you're here blowing up cars.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. You're American and athlete, international celebrity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They'd be like, what is he doing on the front line? There's no real good explanation for it. But through even to the jokes and stuff, it's good to highlight what's actually happening over there. It's obviously very, very bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the morale of the soldiers like? Is there still an optimism? Is there still a hope?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>basically they're marching into certain death at certain locations. Based on the radio transmissions, they know they're going to die, but they head forth anyway. Straightforward into Ukrainian position. Which is just wild to me, I guess World War II, they just keep throwing troops at it. You see a ton of footage they take themselves, which is mind-blowing. Obviously some of this footage doesn't make it to the internet because it's got important details in those conflicts. But they're showing first person perspectives of trench warfare. It's just crazy to see what some of these guys have gone through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I went to a lot of the same places as well, including Kherson. What was your sense of the place?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Kherson was like, it was just so destroyed. I think at this point most of the civilians are gone. I saw a lot of just elderly people left behind, especially a lot of old men. I just think they're just like, hey, I've lived in my whole life, I'm just never leaving. No matter the level of danger, those guys just remain. Then it's largely just, I guess military in Kherson. But that place felt very, very dangerous. I didn't realize until we got there, just quite how destroyed it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How did that experience change you? Just seeing war, head on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to view them military guys, because in Australia and I guess in the US, they don't have this conscription ongoing right now. Whereas obviously there's guys like Roman who volunteered, but then there's a lot of Ukrainian soldiers that were conscripted into the war. It's like you just realize how a lot of these guys are everyday people. They're just in this crazy situation. Where Roman felt obligated to return to Ukraine. From my perspective, anyone from Australia or US, it's just a different perspective on those. They feel different to the regular people fighting in Ukraine, from my perspective.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's defending the land that is your home.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in World War II. They attacked the north. But really there was no foot battle and there was no soldiers on the ground within Australia. I guess US too during World War II. It's like a completely different perspective from our recent histories compared to if you were a Ukrainian and there's Russians within the defined border. Their responsibility to protect their homeland and their family, it's just something you can't imagine. But also after having spent time with them, you can see why they feel such a strong sense of obligation to protect Ukraine, protect their family and friends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In a lot of cases, the soldiers using their own funds to buy equipment. Whether it's bullets, whether it's guns, whether it's armor. Is that still what you saw?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>best equipment. They have to basically find money to pay for it themselves. They'll do that by seeking donations. Best way to get donations would be to grow social media profiles. That's when you see a lot of social media warfare from a perspective of gaining fame to secure donations for their battalion to be able to fight better or protect themselves. Also, some of the social media warfare, I guess is psychological warfare against the enemy. You'll see private Telegram groups where they're showing what they've done to the enemy, what the enemy's done to them. It's just crazy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's Telegram groups on both sides and basically some of it is propaganda, some of it is psychological warfare. Some of it is just the human nature of being, of increasing your own morale and the morale of the people around you by showing off successfully killing other human beings. Which are made other in war. The nature of this war has evolved. Drones have become more and more prevalent. Consumer level, cheap drones. Can you speak to that? Have you seen the use of FPE drones?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to me when he gifted me one of the drones they used. He basically said, he's like, \"Artillery is scary, but a drone will follow you into a building.\" It's a haunting thing to think about. They'll see the drone, they'll hear the drone, they might try to shoot it down or they might try to run. But if it's a kamikaze one, those guys are pretty good at flying them. It's going to chase the soldiers down. A lot of soldiers like pretending to be dead. It's really crazy, some of the footage out there with those FBV drones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a terrifying tool of war and tool of psychological war and used by both sides increasingly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, both sides use it. I remember I was with Roman in Morshyn and he had his break period. He was allowed to leave the country because he basically volunteered to join the army. Ukrainian men can't really leave Ukraine right now. But Roman, I was in Morshyn and this was a surreal experience for him. We went to the beach and there was some tourists there flying a drone, and you just saw his instinctual reaction to that drone sound in the sky, flashback to that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Currently, they're all, as far as I know, all human controlled, so FPV. But to me, increasingly terrifying notion is of them becoming autonomous. It's the best way to defend against the drone that's FPV controlled is for AI to be controlling that drone. Just have swarms of drones that are $500 controlled by AI systems. That's a terrifying possibility that the future of warfare is essentially swarms of drones on both sides. Then maybe swarms of drones, say between US and China over Taiwan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would be wild. They do those crazy drone light shows where they do those performances with the lights and stuff. They're already pretty sophisticated with pre-programming.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those are pre-programmed. The low level control, flight control of those is done autonomously. But there's a interface for doing the choreography that's hard coded in. But adding increasing levels of intelligence to the drone where you can detect another drone, follow it and defend yourself. In terms of the military on both sides as the Ukraine war, that's the technology, that's like the most wanted technology is drone defense. How are you defending as drones on both sides? Anybody that comes up with an autonomous drone technology is going to help whichever side uses that technology to gain a mill- ... is going to help whichever side uses that technology to gain a military advantage. And so, there's a huge incentive to build that technology but then, of course, once both sides started using that technology, then there's swarms of autonomous drones who don't give a shit about humans, just killing everything in sight on both sides. And that's terrifying because there's civilian deaths that are possible that are terrifying, especially when you look 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it's surreal. When we went to coastline, it was the entire sky is just full of drones. At any given time, they could decide to come and attack. So, they could just sit there forever waiting, waiting for you to come out of that building. They'll wait a long time when someone goes and hides inside. Or potentially, if it's an open window, fly straight through the open window to get people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, you're not even safe indoors.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's nowhere to hide and they can wait for a very, very long time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And as far as I know, even politicians, you're in danger everywhere in Ukraine. So, if you want to do a public speaking thing and doing it outside, you're in danger because it's very difficult to detect those drones, it could be anywhere. It's a terrifying life where you don't know if you're safe at any moment anywhere in Ukraine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, sure. It's crazy with what happened to Trump, I thought maybe the next attack on a public figure might come in the form of drone technology, something along those lines. I wonder how they protect against that here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If that happens, just imagine the insanity that would ensue. Because we understand the idea of a gunman with a rifle shooting somebody but, just a drone, just imagine the conspiracy theories. Who controlled that drone?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Where'd it come from? Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And now, everybody, that will just cause chaos.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the range is ever-increasing. One of the battalions in Ukraine, because those FPV drones have short range, pretty short range, but they were able to attach it to one of the larger drones with a signal booster so they could potentially go up to 30, 40 kilometers into the distance. So, the drone that hits you could be flown by someone so far away from you. And if they did that domestically, that would be very frightening to think of the sphere of where it could have come from.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you've talked to the soldiers there, did they have a hope or a vision how the war will end?<|eot_id|>"}

I guess it just seems to everyone that there's going to be no middle ground.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When I was there, there's a optimism that they would be victorious definitively.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to fight for as long as necessary. And in terms of the case by case basis, one of my friends, Dmitri, over there who trains jiu-jitsu in the gym, he was very passionate about it just because of the history. He brought out documents of his grandfather being executed by the USSR. So, I know that when the war started, basically, he took a bicycle helmet and his AK-47 and went out into the streets and he's like, \"I'd rather be dead than live under Russian rule again.\" So, very case by case basis, personal history for them, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did they comment on US politics whether they hoped for Trump or for, in that situation, Biden now Harris to win the presidential election?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but they really try to stay optimistic. Most of the people I spoke to really try to remain optimistic that they would be protected if it comes down to it. But obviously, there was a nine-month period where they weren't refunded. So, as that stretched ... Obviously, they're refunded now but it takes a lot of time to get that equipment back to the points at which they need it. So, if ammunition had ran out, Patriot defense system had ran out, really, really scary prospect there. I don't know, I guess no one knows what's going to happen there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you lie to people and say you were close to the president so they can be nice to you so they can convince you to continue the funding?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that would've been a nice way to the top. Luckily, for me, most of the places I travel to, jiu-jitsu gives me access to so many different individuals, it's super bizarre. Oligarchs, royalty, I guess, tech wizards, it's a strange group of people, a code around the world of just I get strange access just for being good at wrestling dudes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, martial arts, there's a code and there's a respect, a mutual respect. Even if you don't know anything about the other person, if you've both have done martial arts, there's similar things with judo, with jiu-jitsu, with grappling, all of that. I don't know what that is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's like an inner circle.

People around the world really has no ethnic background, religious background, even level of wealth, as cheesy as it sounds, it's a good equalizer on the mats and that community, camaraderie knows no limits there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Including mats, the shadiest mats in some small town in the middle of nowhere?<|eot_id|>"}

The people that his gym didn't know who he was in his country and he trained there, he trained with him for years, cleaned the mats like anyone else.

One of the things I love about no-Gi jiu-jitsu is you don't see rank. So, on a small scale, there's no hierarchy that emerges when you have the different color belts, everybody's the same.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you get to see the skill.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The skill speaks but there's just a mutual respect and whatever.

So, he wants to remain anonymous but he basically just said to enjoy the trolling aspect of it and also contribute to the sport of jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's good to know that the anonymous funder appreciates you for who you are, Craig Jones.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to find Thomas & Mack Event Center, which was their original venue, and it just happened to be available that same weekend which we're very happy about.

We'll pay $10,000 plus one to show up.\" So, to show up in our event, you're going to get paid more than to win ADCC. And not only that, we're going to broadcast it for free.

We've got a bunch of champions or medalists or, really, the top betting favorites for their divisions there, they started, and again, I can't emphasize this enough, allegedly, paying show money which has never historically been done before to keep athletes in their show.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you're saying, allegedly, there were some under the table payments by ADCC?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, karate combat have a square pit, we have a rectangular alley.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Same size at least. But in terms of the training for, obviously, the athletes, it's very difficult.

Because it's 10,001 to show up and a million to win, if you aren't first, you lost, there's no reward for second place. So, I'm punishing the one position I've only ever been able to achieve in tournaments.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you worried that, because of how much money is on the line, people will play careful?<|eot_id|>"}

But I just don't think we're there, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think million dollars is a lot of money, but the opportunity here, because it's open and freely accessible by everyone is to put on a show.<|eot_id|>"}

For me, to give him the opportunity to live in a world where he had won the last match against me, it's hard to put a price on that.

But in terms of our relationship, I'm trying to think of an exact time where it went south, but I guess in my... Him being the ADCC organizer, in my attack of athlete compensation was taken personally, which is obviously going to ruin whatever friendship you had.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that started around the time you were thinking about CJI.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, to be honest, CJI was a result of the response of my discussion of athlete compensation.

But again, considering what I know about Thomas & Mack's price, which I believe we're paying $200,000 for, and T-Mobile's $2 million. How do you justify no increase in athlete pay? Well, we have a $1.8 million increase in venue cost.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you're saying that there could potentially be poor business decisions, poor allocation of money that could be reallocated better to support the athletes?<|eot_id|>"}

I don't think we need T-Mobile. I don't think we need it behind a paywall. I think we need cheap venue, still maintain good quality production. Release it for free.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just say, \"Hey, show us the books.\" You know what I mean? Honestly, when our event's done, we're going to be pretty transparent. Obviously, we are run as a nonprofit. We're going to be pretty transparent about everything. And I mean, obviously, ultimately, all the views we get. When FloGrappling, when an event on FloGrappling or Fight Pass or any other streaming provider, unless it's a pay-per-view, you're not going to know how many people watched. So, that's one aspect of what we're doing is we're going to have a visual guide to how many people off hands of grappling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, transparency in all of its forms. That's what bothers me about the IOC with the Olympics is that there's this organization that puts on an incredible event, but it's completely opaque, it's not transparent and the athletes don't get paid almost at all. So, it's usually from sponsorships and they sell distribution, broadcast distribution. And so, it's mostly pay walled after the fact. It's very... Unless you're a super famous athlete or a famous event, it's hard to watch. I don't know the early rounds of the weightlifting or the judo or all of the competitions where most of those athletes get paid almost nothing and they've dedicated their whole life like, they've sacrificed everything to be there and we don't get to watch them openly. And in many cases, you can't even pay for it. With IOC, I've got to experience this because I'll have podcast conversations with judoka for example, and I put a little clip in a podcast and the Olympics channel takes it down immediately. So, they have all the videos uploaded private, they're private.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, to flag the copyright.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They just flag the copyright automatically. From the private videos, they could release, they could release somewhere, even if it's paywall, which I'm against. But paywall, but make it super easily accessible. So, the FloGrappling model is still okay. I'm against it. But if you do a really good job of it, okay, I can understand a membership fee, but it should be super easy to use. But in the case of the Olympics, first of all, in the case of the Olympics, the whole point of the Olympics is for it to be accessible to everybody. So, paywalling goes against the spirit of the Olympic Games. And I will say the same is probably true for many sports I grappling, especially from major events like ADCC that I feel like they should be openly accessible to everybody on every platform. But what was the decision like for you to make it accessible on YouTube and X and...<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like that. But I think a more modern approach to the promotion of the event, again, I keep going back to the comedians. You know what I mean? If you want to grow your brand, whatever that may be, provide content for free and you can paywall. Eventually, you can grow the audience, create the audience free. I think, again, if your goal is to create a huge sport here, then it's like if we're already a niche sport and competition aspect of that, is it even smaller niche? Then, we need to grow that providing this content for free.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, having just chatted with Elon Musk who fundamentally believes that the most entertaining outcome is the most likely, that to me, if the universe has a sense of humor, you would certainly, Craig Jones would certainly be running ADCC, which would be, I mean, it would just be beautifully hilarious.<|eot_id|>"}

So, whether you feel like you're training hard enough, you're over training. Those to me are the most difficult aspects. And I think really, those are an individual thing and that's really something where a coach can provide what he thinks to you is the right amount of work. And I think that's different for different people. I think Nicky Rod could do eight hours a day, you know what I mean? I think Nick Ryan, 8 minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I saw a video of Nick Ryan with a trashcan throwing up.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is satisfying to watch, honestly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But yeah, so you're supposed to train hard enough to where you have this confidence that you're prepared.<|eot_id|>"}

Obviously, you don't want that to be the standard. You've got to be putting in the work at all times. But even now in my crazy travel schedule where I don't train anywhere near like I used to. As long as your game is technical, and as long as your body's in good condition, I believe you can still train well against world-class guys. You might not be able to do an hour straight, but if you're technique-orientated, you're just losing fitness.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, is it possible to out cardio Craig Jones?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so. I think that's the only logical explanation. And I also use it as mind games too. Again, no one knows whether what I'm saying is true or not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}

Is he baiting me? Is he really that unconcerned?\" You know what I mean? It's almost a psychological battle in and of itself, but for the most part it's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, to you, being psychologically relaxed is extremely important, just not giving in them, I wonder what that is.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the training for me. But nowadays I like to, if I train short duration, high intensity, that's the best for me. I don't like this six little, like 10, six minute rounds, whatever. I don't like this long training. For me, it's too much toll on the body. I think I go to the gym, maybe the first round's slightly light, and then just bang it out. Two hard rounds tops, a little bit of problem solving. Get out of there. Because you want to feel a little bit of the competition intensity. That feels the best on my body.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you're traveling, you're doing seminars and you're just doing Jiu-Jitsu with folks, are you training with them?

There's these sharks that are circling wanting to attack you, and you have to look it... You look at it from both perspectives. I think you should provide excellent technique. Excellent question and answer time. And I think you should roll a little bit. For the most part, these days I'll just roll 30 minutes straight. I'll just do 10 guys, three minutes, no break. 30 minutes straight. I might even get the guy to pick, again if you... Some of these guys come in hot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's terrifying, man.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can't do it. If you've reached any level of notoriety, whether it's in the sport or just as a celebrity, you're better off to just have three, four trusted training partners and train privately. That's the sad situation. People used to say, \"Oh, you could be such and such and go to any gym.\" No. Those days are over now.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is humorous after the fact though. I mean it's just like, \"Hey bro, I'm jet lagged, I'm tired. I'm here for you guys. Why are you trying to hurt me?\" If I get a submission tap, don't hesitate at all. Don't hesitate. I mean, Jiu-Jitsu's dangerous. It's a dangerous thing.

Mental, physical in terms of practice in Jiu-Jitsu.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>could potentially train five years without injury. It's really about how you move. If you are always moving in an explosive way, eventually you're going to do that from a position in which you can't move and then something's going to tear. And you also want to be able to trust training partners to not go too crazy and inflict too much pain. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, I think I've managed to avoid a lot of injuries. I just never roll too athletically, explosively. I think I'm probably incapable of moving at that rate of speed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's part of it is you the way you move.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I let them put me in bad position, but I try to stay relaxed at all times. That's the key here is, I mean, yeah, obviously you've got the cheesy, keep it playful. But it's like if you can remain calm in bad positions, that is a skill. That's your confidence not in yourself, but that the other guy's incapable of submitting you. That's the ultimate confidence. You can give him whatever you want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the thing you want as a beginner is to focus on minimizing injury by relaxing, by not freaking out.<|eot_id|>"}

I mean I see a lot of beginners breathing, starting to breathe hard, they tense up. That's probably, underneath that is panic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you can make someone panic, you'll fatigue them. It's the same, it's like even if you higher level and you're worried about getting your guard passed, it's the panic that leads to fatigue in your guard retention. But if you're so flexible, you remain calm. I think it's because you're not panicked.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Fear is the mind killer. But also you have one of the more innovative games in Jiu-Jitsu history. How'd you develop that? How do you continue throughout your career? How were you innovating? What was your approach to learning and figuring positions out? Figuring submissions out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>finding creative ways to beat people. And sometimes creativity is in how they respond to it. So if you can find a humiliating move to do to someone, well, not even necessarily humiliating, but a move that is unexpected. When you get hit with something you don't expect, I think that is sort of really one of the most fun aspects of it. You know what I mean? You train to stay better than the people you're better than. That's what keeps you in the game. And finding creative ways to beat those people is some of the most entertainment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's just something that brings you joy, by doing the unexpected.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you get swept with something that you don't think should work, I think that's fulfillment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So your game is even a bit trolly, interesting. But what's the actual process of, with the Z Guard, all the innovative stuff you've done there, how do you come up with ideas there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just studying tape. Just study. Study tape and try to reverse engineer. If I see something or I train with someone, and it feels... You know when you have those moments where you're like, \"Oh, I don't even know what they're doing here.\" And if you can put someone in a position they don't understand, that's also where they panic. So it's creating different ways to make people panic. But also, I mean just innovation, like having fun with it. I guess the artistic aspect of it is fun. You can be creative in how you can beat people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you say artistic or autistic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Both. Both.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Just checking. What's the most innovative thing you've come up with? What's some of the cooler ideas you've come up on the mat?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think I've come up with anything, but I've popularized things. Like certain styles of leg entry.

But also in terms of what I've learned on a technical level, I've picked up a lot of stuff from him in sort of grappling exchanges. How to get back up. Obviously, wall wrestling. In terms of how hard he trains, how hard he works the cardio aspect is insane.

You see the character change. It's just absolutely insane to watch. On the other side of that is obviously watching the ups and downs. It's been so many ups. The last two have been downs.

Obviously we check in as friends, see what he's up to, see what he's planning. We were trying to get him a grappling match at CJI.

I really think he has a huge strength advantage against Makhachev and I personally believe he has a fence wrestling advantage.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can just forward pressure, eat some shots, grind a guy against the wall. Fence wrestling is technical. Jiu-jitsu is far more technical. There's way more things you can do in a grappling scenario from top and bottom than I think against the wall. So a grinding nature of how they train works really good to walk a guy down and take him down against the wall. And then obviously with ground and pound, very good to hold a guy down. So I think just never conceding an inch in training. It's just they've done that since they were born, basically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you learn how to grind somebody down?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they're just trying to break each other at all times.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some of that grinding pressure. I think that has to be met with more slow technical lateral movement. I think that's the way you... That would be the dream for me is that guy just comes straight forward into my guard. That grinding approach works well if he's taken me down and got already close to me. But if I'm laying flat on my back and he's standing and he has to engage, he has all that danger at range. But if he can connect to my body before we go down, now we're in his world again. I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder if it's like, at his prime could be versus you for example. Who do you think wins there?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Catch anyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Really? Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're not a buggy believer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm not a buggy hater either. I'm just, I'm agnostic on the buggy choke.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Khabib would go to sleep for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's no way he would tap to a buggy choke. Who was it? I faced recently, I faced a Russian guy from Tata. I couldn't buggy him. I was trying a closed guard one though, sort of. It is harder to pull off, but I had to put him to sleep twice at the end of the match with a triangle. But he was just willing. I don't know, Eastern European guys, it's like they're treating it like a real fight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you ever gone hard with a Dagestani person? Grappling, wrestling, any of the fighters, any of the MMA guys?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Have I, have I, have I? I mean they do train hard. They do train hard. When I did the seminar in Odessa, it was at a school, but another school in the city brought like 10 Dagestani guys. All of them went insanely hard. I was like, \"Guys,\" it's a small sample size, but they all wanted to be broken.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think, you as the wise sage of Jiu-Jitsu, if you look 10, 20 years out, how do you think the game is going to evolve? The art of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The art of it. I mean, I think obviously people are going to keep innovating, perfecting certain things, throwing out information, bad sort of techniques, bad sort of... But I mean it's so hard to predict. It's like that's the game of making money off the instructionals is predicting where we go next. It's so, so difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is going to be the most popular submissions on CGI and ADCC this year? Is it going to be footlocks or rear naked?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think actually CGI, I think there's going to be a lot of guys that don't tap, that take injuries. A small concern is that a guy wins the match but is so injured he can barely go onto the next match. Win the battle, lose the war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We are going to see that. Aren't we? People refusing to tap.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>integration of wrestling into Jiu-Jitsu. I think that would be the most exciting way the sport could progress. It's basically folk style wrestling, but an integration of submissions from the standing position too. If you just follow the rules of you should always be fighting to get on top, whether that's a submission that leads to a sweep or a sweep. And you should be trying to avoid being pinned. And as long as the game revolves around that and guys engage each other offensively on their feet, that would be the most exciting, best way to watch the sport.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. When I show the sport of Jiu-Jitsu, the most exciting stuff is whenever both people want to be wrestling, scrambling, wrestling, they both want to get on top.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the scramble.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That looks like fighting versus guard stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm a guy that totally agrees with you, but if I think the guy's a better wrestler, I'll concede. It's like that's the hard part.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then the whole crowd will then mock you ceaselessly, as they should for conceding.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's what the million should be. We should have a tournament or a round-robin thing where it's like the million goes to the most exciting man, who took the most risks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, in a way that's what's going to happen because this is quite open. So the benefit of being exciting is you're going to be glorified on social media and if you're going to be boring and stall, you're going to be endlessly sort of willified.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Forget about medals, social media glory is all that matters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, in a certain sense, on a basic human level, yeah. I mean not all that matters. But if you're going to stall, you're going to become a meme I feel like, especially with CGI. Are the refs going to try to stop stalling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we're going to penalize them hard. Hit them hard, get that boring shit out of here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what percentage of athletes would you say are on steroids? Is it a hundred percent?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Anyone that's ever beaten me, they're taking more steroids than me. I don't know. I wanted to test them, but not to do anything bad, but just in the name of science to see what people are running. It's so hard to say because you train with people and they don't even tell you what they're on. I tell the world what I'm on and they go, \"Look at you, you're not taking any steroids.\" It's like such a secret thing. I personally think it's almost impossible to say, but occasionally you look at a guy and you're pretty certain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The looks of it. But it could also go the other way. Certain people are just genetically built and they look like they are. And then there's probably others like yourself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a self-defense mechanism. You'd rather assume that that guy was on steroids than his genetics are so far superior to yours. You're like, \"Nah, it must be steroids.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the part of accusations of people being on steroids that I hate. It's like without data, people are just like, it's a way they can say that somebody's cheating without... Because I like celebrating people and sometimes people aren't on steroids and they aren't cheating and they're just fucking good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What about Gabby Garcia?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think she's beautiful, strong. You're a lucky man to share the mat with her. You should be honored. I am betting a huge amount of money on her, so...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Me too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Either way, you're going to get paid.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She's paying 11 to one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I bet on love as well. So we are aligned in that way.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I thought he was dead for a second. But I, for some strange reason, couldn't stop laughing. I don't know.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was like, his blood pressure is higher than mine. I hope that didn't cook him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that would be quite sad.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, he's probably the most just entertaining human being ever. He just says the... Like, off-air. He's always on. He's always ready to say some wild shit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The craziest shit possible. What's it like going to sleep? I somehow have never gone to sleep.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I went to sleep one time. Lachlan Charles was demonstrating a technique on me, but I woke up straight away.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I just didn't know what was going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And then you load it... That must be a cool feeling to load it all back in. Realize, \"Where am I?\" I feel like that sometimes at a hotel when I'm traveling. It's like, \"Where the fuck am I again?\" When you wake up.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That you can still make fun of anything. As long as it's funny. That's what I'm fighting for. People talk about cancel culture.
