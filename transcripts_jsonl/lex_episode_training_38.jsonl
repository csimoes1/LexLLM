This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Mark Cuban. You've started many businesses, invested in many businesses, heard a lot of pitches privately and on Shark Tank. So you're the perfect person to ask what makes a great entrepreneur?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Somebody who's curious, they want to keep on learning because business is ever-changing. It's never static. Somebody who's agile, because as you learn new things and the environment around you changes, you have to be able to adapt and make the changes. And somebody who can sell, because no business has ever survived without sales. And as an entrepreneur who's creating a company, whatever your product or service is, if that's not the most important thing and you're just dying and excited to tell people about it, then you're not going to succeed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's also a skill thing. How do you sell? What do you mean by selling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bags? Do you need garbage bags? Well, let me save you some time. I'll bring them to your house and drop them off to streaming. Why do we need streaming when we have TV and radio? Well, you can't get access to your TV and radio everywhere you go. So we break down geographic and physical barriers, and Cost Plus Drugs. What's the product that we actually sell? We sell trust. In a simplistic approach, we buy drugs to sell drugs, but we add transparency to it. And bringing transparency to an industry is a differentiation, and it helps people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Trust in an industry that's highly lacking in trust.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So what's the trick to selling garbage bags? Let's go back there. At 12 years old, is it just your natural charisma? I guess a good question to ask, are you born with it or can you develop it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, you can definitely develop it. Yeah. Because selling garbage bags door to door was easy, right? It was like... 12-year-old Mark going, \"Hi, my name is Mark. Do you use garbage bags?\" You know what the answer is going to be, right? \"Can I just drop them off for you once a week? Whenever you need them, you just call and I'll bring them down.\" \"Sure.\" So that was easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I'm sure you've been rejected.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah. Of course. Not everybody says yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was your percentage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't remember, but it's pretty close to a hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, okay. So that's why you don't remember.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>area networks and at MicroSolutions. And the salesmanship was walking into a company and just saying, look talk to me and I can help you improve your productivity and your profitability. Is that important to you? And the answer is obviously always yes. And then the question is, can I do the job and can I do it cost effectively? And so you didn't have to be a born salesperson to be able to ask those questions, but you have to be able to be willing to put in the time to learn that business. And that's the hardest part.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sure there's a skill thing to it too, in how you solve the puzzle of communicating with a person and convincing them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can give me an example of any type of business and it'll take me two seconds to figure out how they make money and how I can make them more productive. And I think that's probably my biggest skill, being able to just drill down to what the actual need is, if any. And then from there, being able to say, well, if this is what this company does, and this is what their goal is, how can I introduce something new that they haven't seen before? And is that a business that I can create and make money from?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So figure out how this kind of business makes money in the present and then figure out, is there a way to make more money in the future by introducing a totally new kind of thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can just do that with anything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pretty much. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you think you're born with that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I worked at it. Because going back to what I said earlier about curiosity, you have to be insanely curious because the world is always changing. My dad used to say, we don't live in the world we were born into, which is absolutely true. If you're not a voracious consumer of information, then you're not going to be able to keep up. And no matter what your sales skills or ability are, they're going to be useless.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You learn about life from your dad. You mentioned your dad.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You've got to figure it out for yourself. But he was also very insistent that... He worked at a company called Regency Products where they did upholstery on cars, and he would bring me there to sweep the floors, not because he wanted me to learn that business, because he wanted me to learn how backbreaking that work was. He lost an eye in an accident at work, a staple broke, and the only thing he wanted for my brothers and I was for us to never have to work like that, to go to college to figure it out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said to be nice. That said, you also said that when you were first starting a business, you were a bit more of an asshole than you wish you would've been.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, because I was more of a yeller. I didn't have-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, really? Mark Cuban?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What you see on the sidelines would be at a Mavs' game. Maybe a little bit. But I also didn't have any patience for somebody I thought wasn't using my common sense, because I was always on the go, go, go, go, go, particularly when I was younger, just trying to be successful, trying to get to the point where I had independence. And I would tell this to people. Either you're speeding up and getting on the train, or we'll stop and drop you off at the next station, but let's go where you go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you have trouble with the hire fast, fire fast part of running a business?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, always, because I hated firing people. 'Cause it meant, one, it was an admission of a mistake in the hiring. And two, the salesperson in me always wanted to come out ahead, and I was always horrible at firing, but I always partnered with people who had no problem with it. So I always delegated that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's the tricky thing. When you're working with somebody and they're not quite there, and you have to decide, are they going to step up and grow into the person that that's the right or they're not. And in that gray area is probably where you have to fire.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it's hard, yeah, for sure because it's obviously a failure somewhere in the process. What did we do wrong? And when I would interview people for jobs, 99% of the people I've ever interviewed I've wanted to hire, because in my mind, it was like, okay, I can figure out how to make this person work. And then they wouldn't. And then people at the company would be like, \"Mark, you suck at this.\" And so I always delegated the hiring.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I'm the same. I see the potential in people. I see the beauty in people, which is a great way to live life. But when you're running a company, it's a different thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's different. And you got to know what you're good at and what you're bad at, right? I was good at... I was a ready-fire-aim guy, and I always partnered with people who were very anal and perfectionist because where I could just go, go, go, go, go, go, they would keep me inside the baselines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They would do the due diligence, I suppose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, or just, yeah, the detail work, the dot the I's and the cross the T's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does it take to take that first leap into starting a business?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the hardest part. It really depends on your personal circumstances. I got fired. I was sleeping on the floor of six guys in a three-bedroom apartment, so I couldn't go any lower. So there was no downside.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Starting at the bottom.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there was no downside for me starting a business. And it was just like... I was 25 when we started MicroSolutions, and I'd just gotten fired and it was like, look, I'm a lousy employee. I'm going to just start going to some of my prospects that I had at my job and asked them to front the money that I needed to install some software and found this company, Architectural Lighting, who put up $500 for me. That allowed me to buy software and have 50% margins and that's how I started my company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But by way of advice, would you say? It's a terrifying thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's, okay, maybe I'm comfortable, maybe I have responsibilities. And so whatever your circumstances are, if you want to take that next step, you have to be able to deal with the consequences of changing your circumstances. And that's the first thing. Do you save money? If you have a job, but d'you have a mortgage? Do you have a family? You've got to save money. You can't just walk. They've got to eat and they've got to have shelter. But on the other side of the coin, if you've got nothing, it's the perfect time to start a business.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Desperation is a good catalyst for starting a business, but in many cases, the decision, as you're talking about you're going to have to make is to leave a job that's providing some degree of comfort already. So I suppose when you're sleeping on the floor and there's six guys, it's a little bit easier.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>obligations, you'll put in the work to learn as much as you can about that industry so that when you start your business, you're prepared. And you can always, at night, on weekends, whenever you find time, lunch, start making the calls to find out if people will write you a check or transfer you the money to buy whatever it is you're selling. And by doing those things, you can put yourself in a position to succeed. It's where people just think, okay, Geronimo, I'm leafing off the edge of a cliff and I'm starting a business. That's tough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But sometimes that's the way you do it, though.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's always examples of any situation or scenario, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Anecdotal evidence for everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But if you're going into a new business, you're going to have competition unless you're really, really, really, really, really lucky. And that competition is not going to just say, okay, let Lex or Mark just kick our ass. And so, you've got to be prepared on how you're going to deal with that competition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think that is about America that has so many people who have that dream and act on that dream of starting a business?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we've just got a culture of consumption and more. And to get more, you've got to... Creating a business gives you the greatest potential upside and the greatest leverage on your time, but it also creates the most risk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that capitalist machine, there's a lot of elements. By contrast, the respect for the law, like an entrepreneur can trust that if they pull it off, the law will protect them. There won't be a government.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Hopefully that's still the case. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah. There's always...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>been to every country around the world, and the one thing that separates us is entrepreneurship. We're the most entrepreneurial country in the world, and there's no one else who's even close.\" And when you look at the origin of the biggest companies in the world, for the most part, there's an American origin story somewhere behind there. And I think that just gets perpetuated on itself. We see those Horatio Alger stories, we see examples of the Jeff Bezos of the world, the Steve Jobs of the world, and those are the types of people we want to copy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we want to be really careful and try to really figure out what that is because we don't want to lose that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We want to protect the... Whatever. And that's a lot of the discussions about what's the right way to do government, big government, small government, what's the right policies, but also culture, who we celebrate. One of the things that troubles me is that we don't enough celebrate the entrepreneurs that take risks and the entrepreneurs that succeed. It seems like success, especially when it comes with wealth, is immediately matched with distrust and criticism and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>progressive that were like, billionaires are bad or millionaires are bad, depending on the time period, but you didn't really see it on an ongoing basis. It wasn't going to be on the evening news. It wasn't going to be in the front page of the newspaper. It was going to be if you read a book and someone talked about it, or you read a magazine and there was an article talking about this progressive movement or that progressive movement, whatever it may be, or political parties. But now all of that is front and center in social media.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we're trying to figure it out, how we deal with the mobs of people and the virality of it all. And I think we'll find our footing and start celebrating greatness again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that's the whole reason I do Shark Tank.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's true. That show celebrates the entrepreneur. That's true.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can have this idea and get a deal or even present to the Sharks and have all of America see it, you can do it. And I'm proud of that. 15 years of that, it's just been insane. Now kids walk up to me and go, yeah, I started watching you when I was five or 10, and I started a business because I learned about it from Shark Tank. And so I think it celebrates it, and we convey it, and I don't think it's going away, but there are different battles we have to fight to support it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I love even when the business idea is obviously horrible. Just the guts to step up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To be there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To believe in yourself. To really reach. That's what matters, because some of the best business ideas are probably, maybe even you and Shark Tank will laugh at.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, for sure. Without question. The good ones, we're not going to recognize every good one. And then sometimes we'll just motivate people to work even harder to get it done because of what we say to them, and that's fine too. There's been great success stories that we said no to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What stands out as a memorable business on you've been pitched on Shark Tank. What's the best one that stands out on-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we typically get businesses that need some help at some level or another. But there's ones I've passed that I wish Spikeball, do you know what Spikeball is? So it's just rebounding net that you can put on the beach and you have these yellow balls, and you play a game of, it's just a competitive game, but they're killing it. So if you go to beaches in New York or LA, you'll see kids playing it all the time. And it was a fun game that I wish I had done a deal with, and there's been others.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you passed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I passed. They were getting some traction and they wanted to create leagues, Spikeball leagues, and they wanted me to be the commissioner, and I don't want to be a commissioner of a new Spikeball league.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you have to have this gut feeling of will this scale, will this click with people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course, yeah. Can it be protected? Is it differentiated? Is it something that makes me think, why didn't I think of that? Or is it just a good solid business that's going to pay a return to the founder and may not be enough of a business to return to an investor?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and I guess the question you're trying to see, will this scale? There's promise? Will the promise materialize into a big thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there was nothing outrageously special about it. I didn't see it becoming a hundred-million-dollar business. I thought it could become a two, three, five-million-dollar business that paid the bills for her. And that was good enough. And six months after the show aired, she called me up, she goes, \"Mark, I've got a million dollars in the bank. What am I going to do?\" I'm like, \"Enjoy it. Put aside money for your taxes and go back to work.\" And so it doesn't have to be a huge business. It's just got to be one that makes the entrepreneur happy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then there's the valuation piece. Do a lot of the entrepreneurs overvalue their business?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the nature of it, right? And that's really where the biggest conflicts in Shark Tank happened. That's an evaluation.

We had one lady couple that came on and they had this scraper for cat's tongues, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bizarre. One of the most bizarre pitch ever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And they had this insane valuation and it was on because it was corny and fun TV, not because it was a good business.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, really? Okay. You didn't see the potential.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in after-tax cash flow that they're able to distribute. Can they do it or can they not? Right? And if it's a $2 million... Whatever the valuation is, that's how much cash, after-tax cash they have to generate to return that money to investors. Or the other option is, do I see this as business potentially having an exit? Do they have some unique technology or do they have something specific about them that some other company would want to acquire? Then the cash flow isn't as, I don't want to say important, but isn't going to guide the valuation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And how do you know if a company's going to be acquired? So it's the technology, like the patents, but also the team, is it-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it could be any of the above. It could be a super products' company that I think is going to take off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And how do you know if they can generate the money? You made it sound easy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, can the person sell? And if not them, can I do it or someone on my team do it for them?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're looking at the person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, for sure. Yeah. That's where Barbara Corker is the best.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... or exaggerating what they're think or do, all that kind of stuff. Can you see through that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, for sure. Just by asking questions.

Because you don't know. It's all uncertainty. But I think if you're delusional, that works against you because everything's grounded in reality. You've got to execute. You've got to produce, you can have a vision and you can say, this is where I want to get to and that's my mission, or this is my driving principle. But you still got to execute on the business plan, and that's where most people fail.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you have to be kind of two-brained, I guess. You have to be able to dip into reality when you're thinking about the specifics of the product, how to design things, the first principles, the basics of how to build the thing, how much it's going to cost, all of that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to lie to ourselves. Our product is bigger, faster, cheaper, this or that, as if that is a finite situation, that's never going to change. And there's always somebody, I call them leapfrog businesses. Whoever's competing against you, if you do a B or C, they're going to try to do C, D and E, and you better be prepared for that to come, because otherwise they're out of business too. So you're never in a vacuum. You're always competing against sometimes an unlimited number of entrepreneurs that you don't even know exist who are trying to kick your ass.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the tricky part of all this too is you might need to frequently pivot, especially in the beginning.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Hopefully not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you think in the beginning, the product you have should be the thing that carries you a long time.<|eot_id|>"}

And so it's not that pivots can't work and always don't work. They can, but more often than not, they don't. You pivot for a reason. That's because you made a huge mistake.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I also mean the micro- pivots, which is iterative development of a-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah, just iterations. Yeah. Entrepreneurship, having any business is just continuous iteration, continuous. Your product, your sales pitch, your advertising, introducing new technology, how do you use AI or not use AI? Where do you use it? What person's the right person? There's just a million touch points that you're always reevaluating in real , early 'time that you have to be agile and adapt and change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But especially in software, it feels like business model can evolve really quickly, too, like how are you going to make money on this?<|eot_id|>"}

It had the largest first day jump in the history of the stock market at the time. And then a year later we sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock, and I owned right around 30% of the company, give or take. And so after taxes, that's what got me there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of questions there.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A lot of iterations like you talked about. We started in the second bedroom of my house, set up a server.

So we could literally go out and buy CDs and host them and just let people listen to whatever music. And we went from 10 users a day to a hundred to a thousand, to hundreds of thousands to a million over those next four years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How did you find the users?

When Motorola announced a new phone or a new product, we would charge them. And so we used a consumer side to do a proof of concept for the network, and then we would take that knowledge and go to corporations, and that's how we made our revenue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's some selling there with the corporations?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I did all the technology, and then we hired engineer after engineer after engineer to implement it.

We had to take down servers that were doing Chicago Cubs baseball and just make all these on-the-fly decisions because we didn't have the tools to analyze or be predictive. It was all technology-driven and marketing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The acquisition by Yahoo.

It became obvious to Yahoo, AOL, and others that they needed a multimedia component. We had the infrastructure, sales, all that stuff. Yahoo, when we went public in '98 or right before, I think it was, they made an investment of $2 million, which gave us a connection to them. After we went public, they decided they needed to have multimedia, so in April of '99, we made a deal, and then July of 2000 is when it closed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain to me the trickiness of what you did after that?<|eot_id|>"}

The law at the time was you couldn't short any indexes that had more than 5% of that stock in it, of the Yahoo stock.

There were people creating companies with just a website and going public. That's a bubble where there's no intrinsic value at all. People aren't even trying to make operating cap profits, they're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market, that's a bubble. You don't see that right now. You don't see any IPOs right now for that matter, so I don't think we're in a bubble now, but back then, yes, I thought we were in a bubble, but that wasn't really the motivating factor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's possible we're in a bit of an AI bubble right now?<|eot_id|>"}

The NVIDIA GPUs, you couldn't predict that now's the time that they were going to get to that cost-effectiveness where you could create models and train them and although it's expensive, it's still doable.

It's like the early days of streaming and the internet where people used the same technology everywhere, and now they just try different things. And you get one smarter or a couple of smart people in one company like Anthropic, and they do things a little bit better and efficient, model efficiency gets better. So it's just a business choice, but I don't think it should be forced, but I think it's a smart business decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Open sourcing is a smart business decision.<|eot_id|>"}

There was nothing off the shelf. And when the PC industry came along, it was the exact opposite. There was MS-DOS and then Windows, things that were off the shelf that every PC could use. And that changed how people thought about software. And I think the same thing will happen here where it's going to be as models become more efficient and easier and less expensive to train, I think there'll be more reasons to open source.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the hope. It creates more competition and a lot of different diversity of approaches in how they're implemented deployed, what kind of products they create, all of that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a couple of big companies that were doing healthcare initiatives. Branding is so important in the healthcare space for hospitals, the Mayo Clinics, the MD Andersons, they're huge brands. And I don't think they're just going to give up their expertise to some main singular model and say, okay, whatever expertise we have is available to you in Gemini or Chat GPT or so-and-so's version of Meta's open source. There's just, that would be business suicide. And so I think you're going to see each of them have their own models and update them as they go and license them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and make money from the expertise.<|eot_id|>"}

You have, yeah, any expertise evolves and growth and all that kind of stuff, and you want to own that growth. What advice would you give to young people? You have an exceptionally successful career.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Love your life. Find the things that you can enjoy. Be curious. You don't have to have all the answers.

So for anybody young out there listening, enjoy your life. Find things to smile about, be curious, read, watch, expose yourself to as many different ideas as you can because something's going to click at some point. You may be 15, you may be 25, you may be 55, but it can happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One thing to mention is sometimes it's difficult or your parents, people around you might not be conducive or might not be of help in finding the thing you're good at.

But in the education system I came up in, it was a very hard mathematics, science and so on, and it didn't notice that whatever that was in me, but you have to keep the flame going. You have to try to find your way and see what that's useful. And others around you might not always notice it. So it might take time. So it could be lonely. You can really have to find the strength to believe in yourself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, for sure. And I'll tell you one quick story. 1992, I went to Moscow State University to teach kids how to start businesses.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right? Yeah. But it was interesting to me, and I bring it up because they didn't know what the word profit meant. But at the same time, I would go around and meet people, and it was as entrepreneurial right after the Soviet Union fell, entrepreneurship went through the roof. A lot of it was mafia driven, but it was, people found that spark because I think that is natural. And so you just never know when and how and when the circumstances will come together for you to be able to take advantage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That spark is really important to comment on is in Russia and Ukraine, I think the system kind of suppresses that spark somehow.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's going to be interesting with Ukraine if they're able to survive this, because as horrific as it is, as you saw across Europe after World War II, the rebuilding creates opportunities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Rebuilding creates opportunities, but first, the war has to end.

And it's just like they took the time. They were that curious and that interested. And I see it when I talk to schools, when I go to different groups, that spark in kids' eyes that there's something bigger and better and exciting out there. And that's not to say there's not fear. Yeah, climate and any other number of things, but that's the beauty of kids. And I think Gen Z really embodies that. And to me, that's just really exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They dream. They dream big, they see the opportunity for making the world better. It's cool.

Chairs didn't always look like that. Somebody had that idea. Why not you? So when you walk out and, what I make them do, ask yourself, why not me?
