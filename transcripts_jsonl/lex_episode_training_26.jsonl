{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>where it leads to a dramatically better answer as you apply more inference compute, I think that will be the beginning of real reasoning breakthroughs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity, a company that aims to revolutionize how we humans get answers to questions on the internet. It combines search and large language models, LLMs, in a way that produces answers where every part of the answer has a citation to human-created sources on the web. This significantly reduces LLM hallucinations, and makes it much easier and more reliable to use for research, and general curiosity-driven late night rabbit hole explorations that I often engage in. I highly recommend you try it out. Aravind was previously a PhD student at Berkeley, where we long ago first met, and an AI researcher at DeepMind, Google, and finally, OpenAI as a research scientist. This conversation has a lot of fascinating technical details on state-of-the-art, in machine learning, and general innovation in retrieval augmented generation, AKA RAG, chain of thought reasoning, indexing the web, UX design, and much more. This is The Led Fridman Podcast. To support us, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Aravind Srinivas. Perplexity is part search engine, part LLM. How does it work, and what role does each part of that the search and the LLM play in serving the final result?<|eot_id|>"}

The magic is all of this working together in one single orchestrated product, and that's what we built Perplexity for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was explicitly instructed to write like an academic, essentially. You found a bunch of stuff on the internet, and now you generate something coherent, and something that humans will appreciate, and cite the things you found on the internet in the narrative you create for the human?<|eot_id|>"}

That's why the product exists.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of questions to ask there, but first, zoom out once again. Fundamentally, it's about search. You said first, there's a search element, and then there's a storytelling element via LLM and the citation element, but it's about search first. You think of Perplexity as a search engine?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Perplexity, is it a search engine, or is it an answer engine, or what is it?\" Then you see some questions at the bottom, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We're going to straight up ask this right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know if it's going to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is Perplexity a search engine or an answer engine? That's a poorly phrased question, but one of the things I love about Perplexity, the poorly phrased questions will nevertheless lead to interesting directions. Perplexity is primarily described as an answer engine rather than a traditional search engine. Key points showing the difference between answer engine versus search engine. This is so nice, and it compares Perplexity versus a traditional search engine like Google. Google provides a list of links to websites. Perplexity focuses on providing direct answers and synthesizing information from various sources, user experience, technological approach. There's an AI integration with Wikipedia-like responses. This is really well done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Then you look at the bottom, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You were not intending to ask those questions, but they're relevant, like, can Perplexity replace Google?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For everyday searches, all right, let's click on that.

That task, that step of generating related searches of the next step of the curiosity journey of expanding your knowledge, it's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}

Compare Perplexity and Google for everyday searches. Step two, evaluate strengths and weaknesses of Perplexity. Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of Google. It's like a procedure. Complete. Okay, answer. Perplexity AI, while impressive, is not yet a full replacement for Google for everyday searches.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Here are the key points based on the provided sources.

Interesting. I don't know if that's accurate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, Google is faster than Perplexity, because you instantly render the links.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The latency is best.<|eot_id|>"}

I think at the end of the day, Wikipedia looking UI is good enough if the raw content that's provided, the text content, is powerful. If I want to know the weather in Austin, if it gives me five little pieces of information around that, maybe the weather today and maybe other links to say, \"Do you want hourly?\" Maybe it gives a little extra information about rain and temperature, all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. It also depends on when you run. If you're asking in the night, maybe you're not looking for running, but...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, but then that starts to get into details, really, I'd never ask night with the weather because I don't care. Usually, it's always going to be about running, and even at night, it's going to be about running, because I love running at night. Let me zoom out, once again, ask a similar I guess question that we just asked Perplexity. Can you, can Perplexity take on and beat Google or Bing in search?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For them to do this for every single query is a lot of money to be spent, because their search volume is so much higher.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's maybe talk about the business model of Google. One of the biggest ways they make money is by showing ads as part of the 10 links. Can you maybe explain your understanding of that business model and why that doesn't work for Perplexity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>against that word. The price for each AdWord is based on a bidding system, an auction system. It's dynamic. That way, the margins are high.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, it's brilliant. AdWords is brilliant.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the greatest business model in the last 50 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a great invention. It's a really, really brilliant invention. Everything in the early days of Google, throughout the first 10 years of Google, they were just firing on all cylinders.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they get to claim that the transaction on your side happened through their referral, and then so you end up having to pay for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sure there's also a lot of interesting details about how to make that product great. For example, when I look at the sponsored links that Google provides, I'm not seeing crappy stuff. I'm seeing good sponsor. I actually often click on it, because it's usually a really good link, and I don't have this dirty feeling like I'm clicking on a sponsor. Usually in other places, I would have that feeling, like a sponsor's trying to trick me into it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>level, and often, you buy based on what your friends are wearing and things like that. Google benefits regardless of how you make your decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not obvious to me that that would be the result of the system, of this bidding system. I could see that scammy companies might be able to get to the top through money, just buy their way to the top. There must be other...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>queries from ad blockers and things like that, and then use that to gain their site. Use a specific words. It's like a whole industry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's a whole industry, and parts of that industry that's very data-driven, which is where Google sits is the part that I admire. A lot of parts that industry is not data-driven, more traditional. Even podcast advertisements, they're not very data-driven, which I really don't like. I admire Google's innovation in AdSense that to make it really data-driven, make it so that the ads are not distracting to the user experience, that they're a part of the user experience, and make it enjoyable to the degree that ads can be enjoyable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Anyway, the entirety of the system that you just mentioned, there's a huge amount of people that visit Google. There's this giant flow of queries that's happening, and you have to serve all of those links. You have to connect all the pages that have been indexed, and you have to integrate somehow the ads in there, and showing the things that the ads are shown in a way that maximizes the likelihood that they click on it, but also minimize the chance that they get pissed off from the experience. All of that, that's a fascinating gigantic system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a lot of constraints, a lot of objective functions simultaneously optimized.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, so what do you learn from that, and how is Perplexity different from that and not different from that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and e-commerce was actually a negative margin business. For them, it's like a no-brainer to go pursue something that's actually positive margins and expand it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're just highlighting the pragmatic reality of how companies are running?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By being aggressive in one-day delivery, two-day delivery rates, burning money, he got market share and e-commerce, and he did the same thing in cloud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think the money that is brought in from ads is just too amazing of a drug to quit for Google?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and compromise user experience and truthful, accurate answers at the cost of having a sustainable business. The long-term future is unclear, but it's very interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there's a way to integrate ads into Perplexity that that works on all fronts? It doesn't interfere with the quest of seeking truth, it doesn't interfere with the user experience of getting an academic article style output on a question? They asked all of this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of ads. If we figure out something like that, in a way that's actually disruptive to the link click, then I think it can work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's also other ways that people can mess with the output of Perplexity, just like there's super aggressive attacks on Google through SEO, where people try to do search engine optimization, like scammy websites, they're probably trying to game the system. There's probably ways to do that with Perplexity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, it's called answer engine optimization.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Answer engine op...<|eot_id|>"}

Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's an engineering challenge, but when it's done right, obsessively reducing latency, you actually have, there's a face shift in the user experience where you're like, holy, this becomes addicting and the amount of times you're frustrated goes quickly to zero.<|eot_id|>"}

So there's the natural Perplexity interface where you just ask questions, Q&A, and you have this chain. You say that that's a kind of playground that's a little bit more private.

Going to the Drake Equation, based on the search results, there is no definitive answer on the exact number of alien civilizations in the universe. And then it goes to the Drake Equation. Recent estimates in 20 ... Wow, well done. Based on the size of the universe and the number of habitable planets, SETI, what are the main factors in the Drake Equation?
