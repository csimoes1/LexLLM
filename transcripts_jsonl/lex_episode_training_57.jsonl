{"text": "<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Harvard. Her work involves improving our understanding of particle physics, supersymmetry, baryogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Lisa Randall. One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter. We can't see it, but there's a lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books with a Beatles song quote, \"'Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see.\" What is dark matter? How should we think about it given that we can't see it? How should we visualize it in our mind's eye?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just don't see it. Most of our detection, before gravitational wave detectors, we only saw things because of their interactions with light in some sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In theory, it behaves just like any other matter, it just doesn't interact with light.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sooner. That is to say the energy density in dark matter dominates over radiation earlier than you would if you just had an ordinary matter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's part of the story of the origin of the galaxy, part of the story of the end of the galaxy, and part of the story of all the various interactions throughout.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>workers that did all the grunt work. In fact, dark matter was really important in the formation of our universe, and we forget that sometimes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. The unheard voices that do the actual work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we don't see it makes it no less legitimate, it just means that we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have a gravitational interaction with the things we can't see is at the layman level, it's just mind-blowing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>energy density in matter, that's remarkable. Why should that be? Anything could be out there, yet the universe that we see is a significant fraction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but a lot of our intuition, I think operates using visualizations in the mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>teaches you how to go beyond your immediate intuition to develop intuitions that apply at different distances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. How do you anthropomorphize dark matter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I just did, I think. I made it the grunt workers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, that's good. You did. That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, you also write in that book about dark matter, having to do something with the extinction events, the extinction of the dinosaurs, which is a fascinating presentation of how everything is connected. I guess the disturbances from the dark matter, they create gravitational disturbances in the Oort Cloud at the edge of our solar system, and then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting earth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I want to be really clear, this was a speculative theory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love it, though.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you're more likely to have these cataclysmic events such as the amazing one that actually caused the last extinction that we know of for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or for two thirds of the species on the planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it gets amazing for humans. It wouldn't be-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As far-fetched as it might sound, you could actually go and look for the experimental consequences, for the observational consequences to test whether it's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wish you could know high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from, where in the Oort Cloud, why it happened, is it in fact because of dark matter? Just the full tracing back to the origin of the universe because humans seem to be somewhat special. It seems like so many fascinating events at all scales of physics had to happen for [inaudible 00:10:17].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is an incredible story and yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we mess with it too much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it is on a grand scale, earth is a pretty resilient system. Can you just clarify, just fascinating, the shape of things. The shape of the Milky Way's... Of the observable stuff is mostly flat. You said dark matter tends to be spherical, but a subset of that might be a flat disk.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You want to hear about the shape of things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, please.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of certain densities, but these are all questions that are worth asking. Basically if we can figure it out from existing measurements, why not try?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so not all dark matter is made the same.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because it's not something that's just there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way you detect it is gravitational effects on things we can see.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>better chance that you can rule it out because you can look for it. So far, no one has found it. We're still looking for<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>detectors, xenon detectors that look for dark matter coming in, and they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound than exists today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to take that tangent, looking back now, what's the biggest, to you, insight to humanity that the LHC has been able to provide?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>believe in your theories, but you also want to question them at the same time in ways that you're more likely to discover the truth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's also an illustration of grand engineering efforts that humanity can take on and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it happen. It is a demonstration that when people set their minds to things and they commit to it, that they can do something amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also in the United States, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things down to [inaudible 00:17:24].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bureaucracy and politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Politics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And economics. Many things can make them faster and make them slower.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Science is the way to make progress, politics is the way to slow that progress down. And here we are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't want to overstate that because without politics, the [inaudible 00:17:42] wouldn't happen either.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You need broccoli.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bad idea when you can do that, when you can get... Forget the politics and just focus on some particular project. Sometimes that can work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some kind of forcing function, some kind of deadline that gets people to sit in a room together and you're working on a thing. As part of that, you realize the common humanity, that you all have the same concerns, the same hopes, the same fears, that you are all human. That's an accidental side effect of working together on a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so that everyone... When they seem like the other, it's more easy to forget their humanity. I think it is important to have these connections.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Given the complexity, all cosmological scales involved here that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of earth, do you worry about future extinction events?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and we certainly don't think enough about all the animals that we're destroying, all the things that are precursors to humans that we rely on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting to think whether the things that threaten us is the stuff we see that's happening gradually or the stuff we don't really see that's going to happen all of a sudden. I sometimes think about what should we be worried about? It seems like with the asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just happens one day. When I say one day meaning over a span of a few days or a few months, but not on a scale of decades and centuries. We sometimes mostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually, but we can be really surprised.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things happen on a global scale, because that's really what we need.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It certainly shouldn't be a source of division, it should be a source of grand collaboration probably.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Wouldn't that be nice?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I just wonder what it'd be like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful to look at that asteroid enter the atmosphere. Until everything.... Man, that would be one of the things I would travel back in time to just to watch it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one of the things that I think you probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to be there and get extinct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To just experience it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think there's something... It's an event. You're just watching. You're not doing anything, you're just looking at it, so maybe you could just recreate it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I actually heard that there's a nuclear weapon explosion experience in virtual reality that's good to remind you about what it would feel like.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can be in that, but I'm not sure that's going to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards, are you more or less scared?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really good point. That's a good summary of just humanity in general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff, even though it can be dangerous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>definitely see that happening with AI now. I think that was the moral of the battle that just happened, that it's just full speed ahead.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. You write about the experience of facing the sublime in physics, and you quote Rainer Rilke. \"For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure, and we're so odd because it's serenely disdains to annihilate us.\" It's pretty intense. It I think applies to nuclear weapons.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>do, I just want to be clear, I'm doing theoretical physics. Not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up having bigger consequences than you think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Dangerous in a very pragmatic sense. Isn't it still in part terrifying when you think of just the size of things like the size of dark matter, the power of this thing in terms of its potential gravitational effects, just cosmological objects of a black hole at the center of our galaxy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a bigger universe and there's lots to discover and that we're not all there is. Wouldn't it be disappointing if we were all there is?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and the full diversity of other stuff is pretty interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>know what we can observe so far, so the idea that there's other stuff out there that we yet have to figure out, it's exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you an out there question. If you think of humans on earth, life on earth as this pocket of complexity that emerged and there's a bunch of conditions that came to be, and there's Darwinian evolution and however life originated, do you think it's possible there's some pockets of complexity of that sort inside dark matter that we can't see?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Chemistry and biology evolving in different ways.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's no reason to know that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the dark matter sector doesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it could have its own forces, just like the dark matter might not experience our light. Maybe it has its light that we don't experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there could be other kinds of forces.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>far. It's not just in the dark matter sector. Even in our sector, there could be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard model of particle physics. How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what the standard model is?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the deviations. Those deviations are critical because they can tell us what underlies the standard model, which is what we really want to see next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down? What are the places you can see those tiny little deviations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>things that we look for. All of those things could indicate there's something beyond what we know about, which of course would be very exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you just step back and look at the standard model, the quarks and all the different particles and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this little system came to be and underpins everything we see?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we might've even expected based on the principles of special relativity and quantum mechanics. That's a really big question. Why are they what they are?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they originate, there's some mechanism that created the whole thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's one of the things we're trying to study. Why is it what it is?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Even just the mechanism that creates stuff, the way a human being is created from a single cell. It's like embryogenesis, the whole thing, you build up this thing. All of it, this whole thing comes to be from just like a [inaudible 00:34:47].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Don't forget it is interacting with the environment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For sure. Okay, right, right, right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really good question is how much of it is the environment? Is it just the environment acting on a set of constraints? How much of it is just the information in the DNA or any information? How much is it in the initial conditions of the universe versus some other thing acting on it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>go back as far as we can. We try to think theoretically, and we try to think about observational consequences. That's all we can do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One interesting way to explore the standard model is to look at your fun, nuanced disagreement with Carlo Rovelli. When you talked about him writing in his book, \"Electrons don't always exist. They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else.\" You wrote that... I'll just read the whole thing because it's interesting. \"Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they're traded, but that doesn't mean we can't approximate their worth until they change hands. Similarly, electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist. It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object with definite position until the position is measured. But something was there - which physicists use a wave function to describe.\" It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement. Do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest if nobody's there to see it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>whether or not... It would be really weird if the only time things came into existence was when I saw them or I measured them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of weird stuff in the works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>doesn't mean that if I have electron in an atom, it's not there. It's certainly there, and we know about it. Its charge is there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Physics is a kind of way to see the world. At the bottom, what's the bottom turtle? Do you have a sense that there's a bottom reality that we're trying to approximate with physics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sure that we're ever going to get to that bottom level, but I do think we're going to keep penetrating different layers and get further.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just wonder how far away we are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the nature of reality changes so much that even these terms are different. Maybe the notion of distance itself might break down at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also to push back on the we've measured everything, maybe there's stuff we haven't even considered is measurable. For example, consciousness. There might be stuff, just like you said, forces unseen, undetected.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>phenomena that we don't understand, but often there are complex phenomena that will be given in terms of the fundamental ingredients that we know about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That is an interesting question because yes, there's phenomena that are at the higher level of abstractions that emerge, but maybe with consciousness, there is far out people that think that consciousness is panpsychus, that there's going to be almost like a fundamental force of physics. That's consciousness that permeates all that matter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you either have to find evidence of it or you have to show that it's not possible without that, and we're very far from that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think one of the criticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that it requires, if I remember correctly, for dark matter to be weirder than it already is. I think you had a clever response to that. Can you remind...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>know what dark matter is. Weirder than it already is, it's not already anything.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like... For example, there's more dark matter in galaxies than there's between galaxies. It clumps.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot in a relatively short time, depending on how you think of time.

Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Declared that we've solved everything. This also a good place to...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>than I am, so that we come up with interesting ideas that we wouldn't have thought of if either one of us was working individually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would you say the truly big leaps happened top-down? Like Einstein?<|eot_id|>"}

One is on the theorem prover side, Wolfram Alpha where everything's much more precise, and we have large language model type of stuff. One of the limitations of those is it seems to come up with convincing looking things, which we don't know if it's true or not, and that's a big problem for physics.<|eot_id|>"}

Maybe it can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It will raise big questions about what is special about humans that we don't quite appreciate. There could be things that are like that leap of insight that happens, truly novel ideas, that could potentially be very difficult to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be applied to and what will it be optimized to do? There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important we start addressing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What to you is the most beautiful unsolved problem in physics and cosmology, which is really exciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on, but there's probably a lot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, understanding the extra dimensions piece will be really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's from the point of view of particle physics, from the point of view of other kinds of physics, we're just beginning, so who knows?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, if the physics changes throughout is not homogeneous throughout the universe, that'll be weird.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, for the observable universe, it's the same.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, totally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Until it doesn't. You have to resolve it.<|eot_id|>"}
