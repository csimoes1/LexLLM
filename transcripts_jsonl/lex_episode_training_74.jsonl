I thought, \"Oh, I'll write a short biography of Merton.\" When I started to do it, I'd been out of academia, I hadn't been a grad student for a few years then. I felt this huge intimidation because they were going to take my draft and send it to the most prestigious finance professors that we could find to give me feedback for revisions. It felt like being back in grad school. It's like this really oppressive, like, you're going to submit it for a review and you're going to get critiques.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A little bit of the bad part of grad school.<|eot_id|>"}

But then I came back two days later and people had improved it and so forth. So that second half of the experience where with Robert Merton, I never succeeded because it was just too intimidating. It was like, \"Oh, no, I was able to chip in and help, other people jumped in. Everybody was interested in the topic, because it's all in the news at the moment.\" So it's just a completely different model, which worked much, much better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, what is it that made that so accessible, so fun, so natural to just add something?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>much harder because there are fewer topics that are just greenfield available. But you could say, \"Oh, well, I know a little bit about this, and I can get it started.\" But then it is fun to come back then and see other people have added and improved and so on and so forth. That idea of collaborating where people can, much like open-source software, you put your code out and then people suggest revisions. They change it, and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator, it's just a fun, wonderful, quite geeky hobby, but people enjoy it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much debate was there over the interface, over the details of how to make that, seamless and frictionless?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>things like neutrality, talking about what is an encyclopedia, but also talking about more technical ideas. Back then, XML was all the rage and thinking about shouldn't you have certain data that might be in multiple articles that gets updated automatically? So for example, the population of New York City, every 10 years there's a new official census, couldn't you just update that bit of data in one place and it would update across all languages? That is a reality today. But back then it was just like, \"Hmm, how do we do that? How do we think about that?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that is a reality today where it's-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, Wikidata. From a Wikipedia entry, you can link to that piece of data in Wikidata, and it's a pretty advanced thing, but there are advanced users who are doing that. Then when that gets updated, it updates in all the languages where you've done that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really interesting.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>red links or blue links, depending on if the page exists or not. But the thing that didn't occur to me even to think about is that, for example, on the German language standard keyboard, there is no square bracket. So for German Wikipedia to succeed, people had to learn to do some alt codes to get the square bracket, or a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket where they could find one and they would just cut and paste one in. Yet. German Wikipedia has been a massive success, so somehow that didn't slow people down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How is that that the German keyboards don't have a square bracket. How do you do programming? How do you live life to its fullest without square brackets?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a very good question. I'm not really sure. Maybe it does now because keyboard standards have drifted over time and becomes useful to have a certain character. It's same thing, there's not really a W character in Italian, and it wasn't on keyboards or I think it is now. But in general, W is not a letter in Italian language, but it appears in enough international words that it's crept into Italian.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of these things are probably Wikipedia articles in themselves.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... what is an encyclopedia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that, out of copyright text, because they said, \"No, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's a perfectly valid thing.

So for example, as I understand it, in French language encyclopedias, traditionally it would be quite common to have recipes, which in English language that would be unusual. You wouldn't find a recipe for chocolate cake in Britannica. So I actually don't know the current state, haven't thought about that in many, many years now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>State of cake recipes in Wikipedia, in English, Wikipedia?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... is kind of difficult to come by because there's so many variants and it's all debatable and interesting. For something like chocolate cake, you could probably say, \"Here's one of the earliest recipes,\" or, \"Here's one of the most common recipes.\" But for many, many things, the variants are as interesting as somebody said to me recently, 10 Spaniards, 12 paella recipes. So these are all matters of open discussion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, just to throw some numbers, as of May 27, 2023, there are 6.6 million articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 4.3 billion words. Including articles, the total number of pages is 58 million.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does that blow your mind?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>much out there. Of course, what we get into when we're talking about how many entries there are and how many could there be, is this very deep philosophical issue of notability, which is the question of, well, how do you draw the limit? How do you draw what is there? So sometimes people say, \"Oh, there should be no limit.\" But I think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny if you really pause and think about it. So I see in your hand there you've got a BIC pen, pretty standard. Everybody's seen billions of those in life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Classic though.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a classic, clear, BIC pen. So could we have an entry about that BIC pen aisle? I bet we do, that type of BIC pen because it's classic. Everybody knows it, and it's got a history. Actually, there's something interesting about the BIC company. They make pens, they also make kayaks, and there's something else they're famous for. Basically, they're a definition by non-essentials company. Anything that's long and plastic, that's what they make.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow, that's very-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But could we have an article about that very BIC pen in your hand, so Lex Fridman's BIC pen as of this week?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, the very, this instance-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>teacher later, a pharmacist, wonderful woman, but never been in the news, other than me talking about why there shouldn't be a Wikipedia entry, that's probably made it in somewhere, standard example. But there's not enough known. You could imagine a database of genealogy having date of birth, date of death, certain elements like that of private people. But you couldn't really write a biography. One of the areas this comes up quite often is what we call BLP1E. We've got lots of acronyms. Biography of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real danger zone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the same way that it is for member of a royal family where it's basically all about the family. So we're fairly nuanced about notability and where it comes in. I've always thought that the term notability, I think, is a little problematic. We struggled about how to talk about it. The problem with notability is it can feel insulting. Say, \"Oh no, you're not noteworthy.\" Well, my mother's noteworthy. She's a really important person in my life, so that's not right. But it's more like verifiability. Is there a way to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me as I've learned recently, and the first thought I had when I saw that was, \"Surely I am not notable enough.\" So I was very surprised and grateful that such a page could exist and actually, just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people that are part of creating and maintaining Wikipedia. It's my favorite website on the internet. The collection of articles that Wikipedia has created is just incredible. We'll talk about the various details of that. But the love and care that goes into creating pages for individuals, for a BIC pen, for all this kind of stuff is just really incredible. So I just felt the love when I saw that page. But I also felt just because I do this podcast and I just through this podcast, gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial, I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite ... to me as a person who loves other human beings, I've gotten to be at the receiving end of some attacks through Wikipedia. Like you said, when you look at living individuals, it can be quite hurtful, the little details of information. Because I've become friends with Elon Musk and I've interviewed him, but I've also interviewed people on the left, far left, people on the right, some would say far right, and so now you take a step, you put your toe into the cold pool of politics and the shark emerges from the depths and pulls you right in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the boiling hot pool of politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess it's hot, and so I got to experience some of that. I think what you also realize is there has to be, for Wikipedia credible sources, verifiable sources, and there's a dance there because some of the sources are pieces of journalism. Of course, journalism operates under its own complicated incentives such that people can write articles that are not factual or are cherry-picking all the flaws they can have in a journalistic article-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and those can be used as-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... as sources. It's like they dance hand-in-hand. So for me, sadly enough, there was a really concerted attack to say that I was never at MIT, never did anything at MIT. Just to clarify, I am a research scientist at MIT. I have been there since 2015. I'm there today. I'm at a prestigious, amazing laboratory called LIDS, and I hope to be there for a long time. I work on AI, robotics, machine learning. There's a lot of incredible people there. By the way, MIT has been very kind to defend me. Unlike Wikipedia says, it is not an unpaid position. There was no controversy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was all very calm and happy and almost boring research that I've been doing there. The other thing, because I am half-Ukrainian, half-Russian-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and I've traveled to Ukraine and I will travel to Ukraine again, and I will travel to Russia for some very difficult conversations. My heart's been broken by this war. I have family in both places. It's been a really difficult time. But the little battle about the biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me. I also want to clarify personally, I use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there. My father was not born in Chkalovsk, Russia. He was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in Chkalovsk which is a town not in Russia. There is a town called that in Russia. But there's another town in Tajikistan, which is the former republic of the Soviet Union. That town is now called B-U-S-T-O-N, Buston, which is funny because we're now in Austin, and I also am in Boston, it seems like my whole life is surrounded by these kinds of towns. So I was born in Tajikistan, and the rest of the biography is interesting, but my family is very evenly distributed between their origins and where they grew up between Ukraine and Russia, which adds a whole beautiful complexity to this whole thing. So I want to just correct that. It's like the fascinating thing about Wikipedia is in some sense, those little details don't matter. But in another sense, what I felt when I saw a Wikipedia page about me or anybody I know is there's this beautiful saving that this person existed, like a community that notices you that says, \"Huh.\" You see a butterfly that floats, and you're like, \"Huh?\" That it's not just any butterfly, it's that one. \"I like that one,\" or you see a puppy or something, or it's this BIC pen. \"I remember this one, it has this scratch. You get noticed in that way and I know it's a beautiful thing. Maybe it's very silly of me and naive, but I feel like Wikipedia, in terms of individuals, is an opportunity to celebrate people, to celebrate ideas-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure. For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and not a battleground of the kind of stuff we might see on Twitter, like the mockery, the derision, this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course, you don't want to cherry-pick. All of us have flaws and so on, but it just feels like to highlight a controversy of some sort, when that doesn't at all represent the entirety of the human, in most cases, is sad.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>your dad. So of course, I just took that out immediately. This is a long, long time ago. That's the sort of thing where we have to really think about in a biography and about controversies to say, \"Is this a real controversy?\" So in general, one of the things we tend to say is any section, so if there's a biography and there's a section called controversies, that's actually poor practice because it just invites people to say, \"Oh, I want to work on this entry.\" It's either seven sections. \"Oh, this one's quite short. Can I add something?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Go out and find some more controversies. Now that's nonsense, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>probably look for a better source.\" So certainly if the Daily Mail runs a headline saying, \"New Cure for Cancer,\" it's like probably there's more serious sources than a tabloid newspaper. So in an article about lung cancer, you probably wouldn't cite the Daily Mail. That's kind of ridiculous. But also for celebrities and so forth to know, \"Oh, well, they do cover celebrity gossip a lot, but they also tend to have vendettas and so forth.\" You really have to step back and go, \"Is this really encyclopedic or is this just the Daily Mail going on a rant?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some of that requires a great community health.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It requires massive community health.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of, if actually iffy about people I know, things I know about myself, I still feel like a love for knowledge emanating from the article. I feel the community health, so I will take all slight inaccuracies. I love it because that means there's people, for the most part, I feel of respect and love in this search for knowledge. Sometimes, 'cause I also love Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange for programming-related things. They can get a little cranky sometimes to a degree where it's like it's not as ... you could could feel the dynamics of the health of the particular community and sub communities too, like a particular C Sharp or Java or Python or whatever, there's little communities that emerge. You can feel the levels of toxicity, 'cause a little bit of strictness is good, but a little too much is bad because of the defensiveness, 'cause when somebody writes an answer and then somebody else says, \"We'll modify it,\" and then get defensive, and there's this tension that's not conducive to improving towards a more truthful depiction of that topic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, a great example-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... truthful depiction of that topic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing if there is a disparity in the media of how people are called. And I just thought, you know what, nothing for me to weigh in on here. This is a good conversation. Like nobody's saying people should be banned if they refer to, what was his name, The Fridge, Refrigerator Perry. Very famous comparison to an inanimate object of a Chicago Bears player, many years ago. But they're just saying, hey, let's be careful about analogies that we just pick up from the media. I said, \"Yeah, that's good.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the deprecation of news sources is really interesting because I think what you're saying is ultimately you want to make a article by article decision, use your own judgment. And it's such a subtle thing because there's just a lot of hit pieces written about individuals like myself for example, that masquerade as an objective thorough exploration of a human being. It's fascinating to watch because controversy and hit pieces just get more clicks.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is, I guess, as a Wikipedia contributor, you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense, a radar of clickbait versus truth to pick out the truth from the clickbaity type language.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah. I mean it's really important and we talk a lot about weasel words. And actually I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and ChatGPT.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something that's actually not bad. It's just like poetic language and you're like, okay, that's not actually helping. But in many cases I think that sort of thing is quite interesting. And I'm also interested in... Can you imagine where you feed in a Wikipedia entry and all the sources and you say, help me find anything in the article that is not accurately reflecting what's in the sources? And that doesn't have to be perfect. It only has to be good enough to be useful to community. So if it scans-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... an article and all the sources and you say, oh, it came back with 10 suggestions and seven of them were decent and three of them it just didn't understand, well actually that's probably worth my time to do. And it can help us really more quickly get good people to review obscure entries and things like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So just as a small aside on that, and we'll probably talk about language models a little bit, or a lot more, but one of the articles, one of the hit pieces about me, the journalist actually was very straightforward and honest about having used GPT to write part of the article.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then finding that it made an error and apologized for the error, that GPT-4 generated. Which has this kind of interesting loop, which is the articles are used to write Wikipedia pages, GPT is trained on Wikipedia, and there there's like this interesting loop where the weasel words and the nuances can get lost or can propagate, even though they're not grounded in reality. Somehow in the generation of the language model, new truths can be created and kind of linger.<|eot_id|>"}

I was invited a few years ago to do the ceremonial first move in the world chess championship. And I thought, I wonder if they think I'm a really big chess enthusiast because they read this Biography Magazine article.

But if I actually did research and I used something very heavily, it's just proper, morally proper, to give your sources. So we would like to see that. And obviously they call it grounding. So particularly people at Google are really keen on figuring out grounding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's such a cool term.

To me, the question there is, I mean the same is true for Silicon Valley, the task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it. I believe it's possible to do that. There's conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible, and there's this whole conspiracy where the left is controlling it, and so on. I think engineers, for the most part, want to create platforms that are open and unbiased that create all kinds of perspective because that's super exciting to have all kinds of perspectives battle it out, but still is there a degree to which the personal political bias of the editors might seep in in silly ways and in big ways? Silly ways could be, I think, hopefully I'm correct in saying this, but the right will call it the Democrat Party and the left will call it the Democratic Party, right? It always hits my ear weird. Are we children here? We're literally taking words and just jabbing at each other. Yeah, I could capitalize a thing in a certain way, or I can just take a word and mess with them. That's a small way of how you use words, but you can also have a bigger way about beliefs, about various perspectives on political events, on Hunter Biden's laptop, on how big of a story that is or not, how big the censorship of that story is or not, and then there's these camps to take very strong points and they construct big narratives around that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It seems an odd thing to accuse you of because you have quite a wide range of long conversations with a very diverse bunch of people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there is a very, very harsh drop off because what I like is high quality disagreement. That really makes me think. At a certain point, there's a threshold, it's a kind of a gray area when the quality of the disagreement, it just sounds like mocking, and you're not really interested in a deep understanding of the topic, or you yourself don't seem to carry deep understanding of the topic. There's something called intelligence square debates that may- There's something called Intelligence Squared debates. The main one is the British version. With the British accent, everything always sounds better. And the Brits seem to argue more intensely, like they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate. Those people I often disagree with, basically everybody involved, and it's so fun. I learned something. That's high quality. If we could do that, if there's some way for me to click a button that says, \"Filter out lower quality just today,\" just sometimes show it to me because I want to be able to, but today I'm just not in the mood for the mockery. Just high quality stuff, because even flat Earth, I want to get high quality arguments for the flat Earth. It would make me feel good because I would see, \"Oh, that's really interesting. I never really thought in my mind to challenge the mainstream narrative of general relativity, of a perception of physics. Maybe all of reality, maybe all of space is an illusion. That's really interesting. I never really thought about, let me consider that fully. Okay, what's the evidence? How would you test that? What are the alternatives? How would you be able to have such consistent perception of a physical reality, if it's all of it is an illusion? All of us seem to share the same kind of perception of reality,\" that's the kind of stuff I love, but not the mockery of it that cheap, that it seems that social media can inspire.<|eot_id|>"}

And I'm just like, isn't that wild that you would think... First of all, most people never even think about how do computers know about time zones? Well, they know because they just use this file which tells all the time zones and which dates they change and all of that. But there's this one guy, and he doesn't get paid for it. With all the billions of people on the planet, he put his hand up and goes, \"Yo, I'll take care of the time zones.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a lot of programmers listening to this right now with PTSD about time zones. On top of this one guy, there's other libraries, the different programming languages that help manage the time zones for you. But still, within those, it's amazing just the packages, the libraries, how few people build them out of their own love for building, for creating, for community and all of that. I almost like don't want to interfere with the natural habitat of the geek. When you spot him in the wild, you just want to be like, \"Well, careful, that thing needs to be treasured.\" No, I met a guy many years ago, lovely, really sweet guy, and he was running a bot on English Wikipedia that I thought, \"Wow, that's actually super clever.\" And what he had done is his bot was like spell checking, but rather than simple spell checking, what he had done is create a database of words that are commonly mistaken for other words. They're spelled wrong, so I can't even give an example. And so, the word is people often spell it wrong, but no spell checker catches it because it is another word. And so, what he did is he wrote a bot that looks for these words and then checks the sentence around it for certain keywords. So in some context, this isn't correct, but buoy and boy: people sometimes type B-O-Y when they mean B-O-U-Y, so if he sees the word boy, B-O-Y in an article, he would look in the context and see, is this a nautical reference? And if it was, he didn't autocorrect, he just would flag it up to himself to go, \"Oh, check this one out.\" And that's not a great example, but he had thousands of examples, and I was like, \"That's amazing. I would've never thought to do that.\" And I'm glad that somebody did. And that's also part of the openness of the system, and also I think being a charity, being this idea of actually, this is a gift to the world that makes someone go, \"Oh, well, I'll put my hand up. I see a little piece of things I can make better because I'm a good programmer and I can write this script to do this thing, and I'll find it fun,\" amazing.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so I think most people know this, but we're a charity, so in the US, registered as a charity.

Even if I believe in it very strongly, organizations tend to follow the money in the DNA in the long run. And so things like, it's easy to think about some of the immediate problems. So if you go to read about, I don't know, Nissan car company, and if you saw an ad for the new Nissan at the top of the page, you might be like, \"Did they pay for this?\", or, \"Do the advertisers have influence over the content?\", because of wonder about that for all kinds of media.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that undermines trust.<|eot_id|>"}

So, that decision just seemed obvious to me, but as I say, it was less of a business decision and more of an aesthetic. It's like, \"I like Wikipedia that doesn't have ads.\" In these early days, a lot of the ads, that was well before the era of really quality ad targeting and all that, so you got a lot of-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Banners.<|eot_id|>"}

I've been criticized for criticizing Anthony Fauci too hard. The degree to which I criticized him is because he's a leader. And I'm just observing the effect in the loss of trust in the institutions like the NIH that where I personally know there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work, and I have to blame the leaders for the effects on the distrust and the scientific work that they're doing because of what I perceive as basic human flaws of communication, of arrogance, of ego, of politics, all those kinds of things. Now, you could say, \"You're being too harsh,\" possible, but I think that's the whole point of free speech is you can criticize people who lead. Leaders, unfortunately or fortunately, are responsible for the effects on society. To me, Anthony Fauci or whoever in the scientific position around the pandemic had an opportunity to have a FDR moment or to get everybody together, inspire about the power of science to rapidly develop a vaccine that saves us from this pandemic and future pandemic that can threaten the wellbeing of human civilization. This was epic and awesome and sexy. And to me, when I'm talking to people about science, it's anything but sexy in terms of the virology and biology development because it's been politicized. It's icky, and people just don't want to... \"Don't talk to me about the vaccine. I understand. I understand. I got vaccinated.\" There's just, \"Let's switch topics quick.\"<|eot_id|>"}

So the Hitler article had to be two to three times better and more academically researched to beat the competition. This bias seems to hold today, for example, the current list of political featured articles at a glance seems to have only two books, one on anarchism and one on Karl Marx. Surely we're not going to say there have only ever been two articles about political non-biography books worth being featured, especially compared to 200 plus video games.

So, I do think that's going to happen a lot and that's going to accelerate, again, what will remain to most people an invisible trend, but that's the growth in all these other languages. So, then move on to 100 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was starting to get scary.<|eot_id|>"}

But I actually think it is quite interesting this moment in time that we may have in the next 50 years to really, really solve some really long-term human problems, for example, in health. The progress that's being made in cancer treatment, because we are able to at scale model molecules, and genetics, and things like this, it gets huge. It's really exciting. So, if we can hang on for a little while, and certain problems that seem completely intractable today, like climate change may end up being actually not that hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we just might be able to alleviate the full diversity of human suffering.<|eot_id|>"}

But by the way, the people who live in that village, that small town of 50,000, they can't put that in Wikipedia and get it translated into other places. They can't share their culture and their knowledge. And I think for China, this should be a somewhat influential argument, because China does feel misunderstood in the world.
