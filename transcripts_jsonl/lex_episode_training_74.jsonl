{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what we call BLP1E. We've got lots of acronyms. Biography of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real danger zone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in my life, so that's not right. But it's more like verifiability. Is there a way to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me as I've learned recently, and the first thought I had when I saw that was, \"Surely I am not notable enough.\" So I was very surprised and grateful that such a page could exist and actually, just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people that are part of creating and maintaining Wikipedia. It's my favorite website on the internet. The collection of articles that Wikipedia has created is just incredible. We'll talk about the various details of that. But the love and care that goes into creating pages for individuals, for a BIC pen, for all this kind of stuff is just really incredible. So I just felt the love when I saw that page. But I also felt just because I do this podcast and I just through this podcast, gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial, I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite ... to me as a person who loves other human beings, I've gotten to be at the receiving end of some attacks through Wikipedia. Like you said, when you look at living individuals, it can be quite hurtful, the little details of information. Because I've become friends with Elon Musk and I've interviewed him, but I've also interviewed people on the left, far left, people on the right, some would say far right, and so now you take a step, you put your toe into the cold pool of politics and the shark emerges from the depths and pulls you right in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the boiling hot pool of politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess it's hot, and so I got to experience some of that. I think what you also realize is there has to be, for Wikipedia credible sources, verifiable sources, and there's a dance there because some of the sources are pieces of journalism. Of course, journalism operates under its own complicated incentives such that people can write articles that are not factual or are cherry-picking all the flaws they can have in a journalistic article-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and those can be used as-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... as sources. It's like they dance hand-in-hand. So for me, sadly enough, there was a really concerted attack to say that I was never at MIT, never did anything at MIT. Just to clarify, I am a research scientist at MIT. I have been there since 2015. I'm there today. I'm at a prestigious, amazing laboratory called LIDS, and I hope to be there for a long time. I work on AI, robotics, machine learning. There's a lot of incredible people there. By the way, MIT has been very kind to defend me. Unlike Wikipedia says, it is not an unpaid position. There was no controversy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was all very calm and happy and almost boring research that I've been doing there. The other thing, because I am half-Ukrainian, half-Russian-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and I've traveled to Ukraine and I will travel to Ukraine again, and I will travel to Russia for some very difficult conversations. My heart's been broken by this war. I have family in both places. It's been a really difficult time. But the little battle about the biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me. I also want to clarify personally, I use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there. My father was not born in Chkalovsk, Russia. He was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in Chkalovsk which is a town not in Russia. There is a town called that in Russia. But there's another town in Tajikistan, which is the former republic of the Soviet Union. That town is now called B-U-S-T-O-N, Buston, which is funny because we're now in Austin, and I also am in Boston, it seems like my whole life is surrounded by these kinds of towns. So I was born in Tajikistan, and the rest of the biography is interesting, but my family is very evenly distributed between their origins and where they grew up between Ukraine and Russia, which adds a whole beautiful complexity to this whole thing. So I want to just correct that. It's like the fascinating thing about Wikipedia is in some sense, those little details don't matter. But in another sense, what I felt when I saw a Wikipedia page about me or anybody I know is there's this beautiful saving that this person existed, like a community that notices you that says, \"Huh.\" You see a butterfly that floats, and you're like, \"Huh?\" That it's not just any butterfly, it's that one. \"I like that one,\" or you see a puppy or something, or it's this BIC pen. \"I remember this one, it has this scratch. You get noticed in that way and I know it's a beautiful thing. Maybe it's very silly of me and naive, but I feel like Wikipedia, in terms of individuals, is an opportunity to celebrate people, to celebrate ideas-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure. For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and not a battleground of the kind of stuff we might see on Twitter, like the mockery, the derision, this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course, you don't want to cherry-pick. All of us have flaws and so on, but it just feels like to highlight a controversy of some sort, when that doesn't at all represent the entirety of the human, in most cases, is sad.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>invites people to say, \"Oh, I want to work on this entry.\" It's either seven sections. \"Oh, this one's quite short. Can I add something?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so forth.\" You really have to step back and go, \"Is this really encyclopedic or is this just the Daily Mail going on a rant?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some of that requires a great community health.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It requires massive community health.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of, if actually iffy about people I know, things I know about myself, I still feel like a love for knowledge emanating from the article. I feel the community health, so I will take all slight inaccuracies. I love it because that means there's people, for the most part, I feel of respect and love in this search for knowledge. Sometimes, 'cause I also love Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange for programming-related things. They can get a little cranky sometimes to a degree where it's like it's not as ... you could could feel the dynamics of the health of the particular community and sub communities too, like a particular C Sharp or Java or Python or whatever, there's little communities that emerge. You can feel the levels of toxicity, 'cause a little bit of strictness is good, but a little too much is bad because of the defensiveness, 'cause when somebody writes an answer and then somebody else says, \"We'll modify it,\" and then get defensive, and there's this tension that's not conducive to improving towards a more truthful depiction of that topic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, a great example-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... truthful depiction of that topic.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>years ago. But they're just saying, hey, let's be careful about analogies that we just pick up from the media. I said, \"Yeah, that's good.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the deprecation of news sources is really interesting because I think what you're saying is ultimately you want to make a article by article decision, use your own judgment. And it's such a subtle thing because there's just a lot of hit pieces written about individuals like myself for example, that masquerade as an objective thorough exploration of a human being. It's fascinating to watch because controversy and hit pieces just get more clicks.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is, I guess, as a Wikipedia contributor, you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense, a radar of clickbait versus truth to pick out the truth from the clickbaity type language.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean it's really important and we talk a lot about weasel words. And actually I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and ChatGPT.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the sources? And that doesn't have to be perfect. It only has to be good enough to be useful to community. So if it scans-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>probably worth my time to do. And it can help us really more quickly get good people to review obscure entries and things like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So just as a small aside on that, and we'll probably talk about language models a little bit, or a lot more, but one of the articles, one of the hit pieces about me, the journalist actually was very straightforward and honest about having used GPT to write part of the article.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then finding that it made an error and apologized for the error, that GPT-4 generated. Which has this kind of interesting loop, which is the articles are used to write Wikipedia pages, GPT is trained on Wikipedia, and there there's like this interesting loop where the weasel words and the nuances can get lost or can propagate, even though they're not grounded in reality. Somehow in the generation of the language model, new truths can be created and kind of linger.<|eot_id|>"}

Flat Earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the Earth's shape as a plain or disc, meaning ancient cultures subscribe to a flat Earth cosmography with pretty cool pictures of what a flat Earth would look like, with dragon, is that a dragon no angels on the edge.

To me, the question there is, I mean the same is true for Silicon Valley, the task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it. I believe it's possible to do that. There's conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible, and there's this whole conspiracy where the left is controlling it, and so on. I think engineers, for the most part, want to create platforms that are open and unbiased that create all kinds of perspective because that's super exciting to have all kinds of perspectives battle it out, but still is there a degree to which the personal political bias of the editors might seep in in silly ways and in big ways? Silly ways could be, I think, hopefully I'm correct in saying this, but the right will call it the Democrat Party and the left will call it the Democratic Party, right? It always hits my ear weird. Are we children here? We're literally taking words and just jabbing at each other. Yeah, I could capitalize a thing in a certain way, or I can just take a word and mess with them. That's a small way of how you use words, but you can also have a bigger way about beliefs, about various perspectives on political events, on Hunter Biden's laptop, on how big of a story that is or not, how big the censorship of that story is or not, and then there's these camps to take very strong points and they construct big narratives around that.

The thing that the neural net that's learning from that has to figure out is the intent behind you saying, \"I want to see less of this.\" Did you see too much of this content already? You like it, but you don't want to see so much of it. You already figured it out, great. Or does this content not make you feel good? There's so many interpretations that I would like to see less of this, but if you get that kind of signal, this actually can create a really powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day that doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo, that actually just makes you feel good in the good way, which it challenges you, but it doesn't exhaust you and make you this weird animal.<|eot_id|>"}

That really makes me think. At a certain point, there's a threshold, it's a kind of a gray area when the quality of the disagreement, it just sounds like mocking, and you're not really interested in a deep understanding of the topic, or you yourself don't seem to carry deep understanding of the topic. There's something called intelligence square debates that may- There's something called Intelligence Squared debates. The main one is the British version. With the British accent, everything always sounds better. And the Brits seem to argue more intensely, like they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate. Those people I often disagree with, basically everybody involved, and it's so fun. I learned something. That's high quality. If we could do that, if there's some way for me to click a button that says, \"Filter out lower quality just today,\" just sometimes show it to me because I want to be able to, but today I'm just not in the mood for the mockery. Just high quality stuff, because even flat Earth, I want to get high quality arguments for the flat Earth. It would make me feel good because I would see, \"Oh, that's really interesting. I never really thought in my mind to challenge the mainstream narrative of general relativity, of a perception of physics. Maybe all of reality, maybe all of space is an illusion. That's really interesting. I never really thought about, let me consider that fully. Okay, what's the evidence? How would you test that? What are the alternatives? How would you be able to have such consistent perception of a physical reality, if it's all of it is an illusion?

On top of this one guy, there's other libraries, the different programming languages that help manage the time zones for you.

I almost like don't want to interfere with the natural habitat of the geek. When you spot him in the wild, you just want to be like, \"Well, careful, that thing needs to be treasured.\" No, I met a guy many years ago, lovely, really sweet guy, and he was running a bot on English Wikipedia that I thought, \"Wow, that's actually super clever.\" And what he had done is his bot was like spell checking, but rather than simple spell checking, what he had done is create a database of words that are commonly mistaken for other words. They're spelled wrong, so I can't even give an example. And so, the word is people often spell it wrong, but no spell checker catches it because it is another word. And so, what he did is he wrote a bot that looks for these words and then checks the sentence around it for certain keywords. So in some context, this isn't correct, but buoy and boy: people sometimes type B-O-Y when they mean B-O-U-Y, so if he sees the word boy, B-O-Y in an article, he would look in the context and see, is this a nautical reference?

I've been criticized for criticizing Anthony Fauci too hard. The degree to which I criticized him is because he's a leader. And I'm just observing the effect in the loss of trust in the institutions like the NIH that where I personally know there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work, and I have to blame the leaders for the effects on the distrust and the scientific work that they're doing because of what I perceive as basic human flaws of communication, of arrogance, of ego, of politics, all those kinds of things. Now, you could say, \"You're being too harsh,\" possible, but I think that's the whole point of free speech is you can criticize people who lead. Leaders, unfortunately or fortunately, are responsible for the effects on society. To me, Anthony Fauci or whoever in the scientific position around the pandemic had an opportunity to have a FDR moment or to get everybody together, inspire about the power of science to rapidly develop a vaccine that saves us from this pandemic and future pandemic that can threaten the wellbeing of human civilization. This was epic and awesome and sexy. And to me, when I'm talking to people about science, it's anything but sexy in terms of the virology and biology development because it's been politicized. It's icky, and people just don't want to... \"Don't talk to me about the vaccine. I understand. I understand. I got vaccinated.\" There's just, \"Let's switch topics quick.\"<|eot_id|>"}

So the Hitler article had to be two to three times better and more academically researched to beat the competition. This bias seems to hold today, for example, the current list of political featured articles at a glance seems to have only two books, one on anarchism and one on Karl Marx. Surely we're not going to say there have only ever been two articles about political non-biography books worth being featured, especially compared to 200 plus video games.
