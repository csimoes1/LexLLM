Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter, and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in. For example, he was a central figure in the resignation of the President of Harvard University, Claudine Gay, the saga of which we discuss in this episode. This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now to you, friends, here's Bill Ackman. In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing, you mentioned a book, Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, as being formative in your life. What key lesson do you take away from that book that informs your own investing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out what something's worth and you have to kind of weigh it. He talked about the difference between... He said the stock market in the short term is a voting machine. It represents speculative interests, supply and demand of people in the short term. But in the long term, the stock market's a weighing machine, much more accurate. It's going to tell you what something's worth. And so if you can define what something's worth, then you can really take advantage of the market because it's really here to help you. And that's kind of the message of the book.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In that same way, there's a kind of difference between speculation and investing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, speculation is just a bit like trading crypto, right? You're-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Strong words.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going up. That's speculation. And investing is doing your homework, digging down, understanding a business, understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry, understanding what management's going to do, understanding what price you're going to pay. The value of anything, I would say, other than love, let's say, is the present value of the cash you can take out of it over its life. Now, some people think about love that way, but it's not the right way to think about love. So investing is about basically building a model of what this business is going to produce over its lifetime.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you get to that, this idea called value investing? How do you get to the value of a thing? Even philosophically, value of anything really but we can just talk about the things that are on the stock market, companies.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we do is we try to find businesses where, with a very high degree of confidence, we know what those cash flows are going to be for a very long time. And very few businesses that you can have a really high degree of certainty about. And as a result, many investments are speculations because it's really very difficult to predict the future. So what we do for a living, what I do for a living is find those rare companies that you can kind of predict what they're going to look like over a very long period of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what are the factors that indicate that a company is going to be something that's going to make a lot of money, it's going to have a lot of value, and it's going to be reliable over a long period of time? And what is your process of figuring out whether a company is or isn't that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to buy at a price that represents a big discount to that approximation. And that gets back to Ben Graham. Ben Graham invented this concept of margin of safety. You want to buy a company at a price that if you're wrong about what you think it's worth and it turns out to be worth 30% less, you paid a deep enough discount to your estimate that you're still okay. A big part of investing is not losing money. If you can avoid losing money and then have a few great hits, you can do very, very well over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, music is interesting because yes, music's been around for a very long time, but the way to make money from music has been evolving. Like you mentioned streaming, there's a big transition initiated by, I guess, Napster, then created Spotify of how you make money on music with Apple and with all of this. And the question is, how well are companies like UMG able to adjust to such transformations? One, I could ask you about the future, which is artificial intelligence being able to generate music, for example.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There have been a lot of amazing advancements with... So do you have to also think about that. When you close your eyes, all the things you think about, are you imagining the possible ways that the future is completely different from the present and how well this company will be able to surf the wave of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you may have a Neuralink chip in your head instead of a phone, but the music can come in a digitized kind of format, you're going to want to have an infinite library that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain. It's not going to matter that much of the form factor. The device changes. It's not really that important whether it's Spotify or Apple or Amazon that are the so-called DSPs or the providers. I think the value is really going to reside in the content owners. And that's really the artists and the label.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I actually think AI is not going to be the primary creator of music. I think we're going to actually face the reality that it's not that music has been around for thousands of years, but musicians and music has been around. We actually care to know who's the musician that created it, just like we want to know who's the artist, human artist that created a piece of art.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but it's also about the artist and her story and her physical presence and the live experience. I don't think you're going to sit there and someone's going to put a computer up on stage and it's going to play and people are going to get excited around it. So I think AI is really going to be a tool to make artists better artists. A synthesizer really created the opportunity for one man to have an orchestra. Maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist, but not maybe. Maybe it drove even more demand for the live experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Unless that computer has human- like sentience, which I believe is a real possibility. But then it's really, from a business perspective, no different than a human. If it has an identity, that's basically fame and an influence, and there'll be a robot Taylor Swift and it doesn't really matter-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a copyrightable asset I would think, right? Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there'll-<|eot_id|>"}

The world is not going to ask your permission to become what it's becoming, but you could still make money on it. Presumably there'd be a capital system and there'd be some laws under which I believe AI systems will have rights that are akin to human rights and we're going to have to contend with what that means.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's sort of name and likeness rights that have to be protected. Now, can a name be attributed to a Tesla robot? I don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think so. I think it's quite obvious to me.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, so those are more potential artists for us to represent at Universal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly, exactly. All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's sort of one example. Another example could be just the restaurant industry. If you look at businesses like a McDonald's, it's... Whatever, the company's like an 1950 vintage business and here we are, 75 years later, and you can kind of predict what it's going to look like over time. And the menu's going to adjust over time to consumer tastes but I think the hamburger and fries is probably forever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the hamburger and fries are forever. I was eating at Chipotle last night as I was preparing these notes-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I tend to get a double chicken.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Bowl or burrito?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I like the burrito, but I generally try to order the bowl. Cut the carb part.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For health reasons. All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And double chicken, guac, lettuce, black beans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I'm more of a steak guy, just putting that on the record. What's the actual process you go through, literally the process of figuring out what the value of a company is? How do you do the research? Is it reading documents? Is it talking to people? How do you do it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you can get pretty much anyone on the phone and they'll talk to you about an aspect of the industry that you don't understand, want to learn more about. Try to get a sense... Public filings of companies generally give you a lot of information, but not everything you want to know. And you can learn more by talking to experts about some of the industry dynamics, the personalities. You want to get a sense of management. I like watching podcasts. If a CEO were to do a podcast or a YouTube interview, you get a sense of the people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in the case of Chipotle, for example... By the way, I could talk about Chipotle all day. I just love it. I love it. I wish there was a sponsor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'll mention it to the CEO.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Don't make promises you can't keep, Bill.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm not making... Brian Nichols a fantastic CEO. He's not going to spend $1 that he doesn't think is in the company's best interest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right. All I want is free Chipotle, come on now. What was I saying? Oh, and so you look at a company like Chipotle and then you see there's a difficult moment in its history, like you said that there was a food safety issue and then you say, \"Okay, well I see a path where we can fix this and therefore even though the price is low, we can get it to where the price goes up to its value.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>want to earn for investors by paying a really high price. Price matters a lot. You can buy the best business in the world and if you overpay, you're not going to earn particularly attractive returns. So we get involved in cases where a great business has kind of made a big mistake or you've a company that's kind of lost its way, but it's recoverable. And we buy from shareholders who are disappointed, who've lost confidence, selling at a low price relative to what it's worth if fixed. And then we try to be helpful in fixing the company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said that barriers to entry... You said a lot of really interesting qualities of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements that took less than 10 seconds to say, but some of them were... All of them were fascinating. So you said barriers to entry. How do you know if there's a type of moat protecting the competitors from stepping up to the plate?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>systems and building a model that a stranger who doesn't know the restaurant industry can come in and enter the business and build a successful franchise. Now, Chipotle is not a franchise company. They actually own all their own stores, but many of the most successful restaurant companies are franchise models like a Burger King, a McDonald's, Tim Horton's, all these various brands, Popeyes. And there it's about systems, but the same systems apply whether you own all the stores and it's run by a big corporation or whether the owners of the restaurants are sort of franchisees, local entrepreneurs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number, that means they've figured out some kind of system that works. And it's very difficult to develop that kind of system. So that's a moat?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the product at Chipotle is incredible. It's the highest quality food. You can get a serious dinner for under 20 bucks and eat really healthfully and very high quality ingredients. And that's just not available anywhere else. And it's very hard to replicate and to build those relationships with farmers around the country. It's a lot easier to make a deal with one of the big massive food producers and buy your pork from them than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers around the country. And so that is a big moat for Chipotle, very difficult to replicate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And by the way, another company, I think, you have a stake in is McDonald's?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. We own a company called Restaurant Brands. Restaurant Brands owns a number of quick service companies, one of which is Burger King.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Burger King, okay. Well, it's been a meme for a while, but... Burger King is great too. Wendy's, whatever. But usually I go McDonald's, I'll just eat burger patties. I don't know if you knew you could do this, but a burger patty... Burger King can do this, McDonald's. It's actually way cheaper.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They'll just sell you the patty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The patty and it's cheap. It's like $1.50 or $2 per patty and it's about 250 calories and it's just meat. And despite the criticism or memes out there, that's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pretty healthy stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's healthy stuff. And so the healthiest I feel is when I do carnivore. It doesn't sound healthy, but if I eat only meat, I feel really good, I lose weight. I have all this energy, it's crazy. And when I'm traveling, the easiest way to get meat is that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you go to McDonald's, you order six patties.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. So there's this sad meme of me just sitting alone in a car when I'm traveling, just eating beef patties at McDonald's. But I love it. And you got to do what you love, what makes you happy, and that's what makes me happy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think maybe we'll have Burger King feature in it. What about Flame World? What's with these fried burgers? We got to get you to Burger King, grilled burgers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, is this fast food trash? I don't know the details of how they're made. I don't have allegiance-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we got a chance to switch you to Burger King.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Great. We'll see. I'm making so many deals today, it's wonderful. Okay, you were talking about moats, and this kind of remind me of Alphabet, the parent company.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure. It's a big position for us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's interesting that you think that maybe Alphabet fits some of these characteristics. It's tricky to know with everything that's happening in AI... And I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon. It's interesting that you think that there's a moat. And it's also interesting to analyze it because as a consumer, as just a fan of technology, why is Google still around? It's not just a search engine, it's doing all the basics of the business of search really well, but they're doing all these other stuff. So what's your analysis of Alphabet? Why are you still positive about it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>yield. And then there's all kinds of, what we call, optionality in all the various businesses and investments they've made that are losing money. They've got a cloud business that's growing very rapidly, but they're investing basically a hundred percent of the profits from that business and growth. So you're in that earnings number, you're not seeing any earnings from the cloud business, and they're one of the top cloud players. So very interesting, generally well-managed company with incredible assets and resources and dominance, and it has no debt. It's got a ton of cash. And so pretty good story.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something fundamentally different about AI that makes all of this more complicated, which is the exponential possibilities of the kinds of products and impact that AI could create when you're looking at Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, all these companies, xAI, or maybe startups? Is there some more risk introduced by the possibilities of AI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a bit like Buffett talks about a great business, like a castle surrounded by this really wide moat but you have all these barbarians trying to get in and steal the princess. And it happens. Kodak, for example, was an amazing, incredibly dominant company until it disappeared. Polaroid, this incredible technology. And that's why we have tended to stay away from companies that are technology companies because technology companies generally... The world is such a dynamic place that someone's always working on a better version. And Kodak was caught up in the analog film world and then the world changed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Google was pretty fat and happy until ChatGPT came out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How would you rate their ability to wake up, lose weight, and be less happy and aggressively rediscover their search for happiness?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think you've seen a lot of that in the last year. And I would say some combination of embarrassment and pride are huge motivators for everyone from Sergey Brin, to the management of the company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And Demis Hassabis threw them into the picture and all of DeepMind teams, and the unification of teams and all the shakeups. It was interesting to watch the chaos. I love it. I love it when everybody freaks out. Like you said, partly embarrassment, and partly that competitive drive that drives engineers, is great. I can't wait to see what... They've [inaudible 00:32:31] a lot of improvement in the product, let's see where it goes. You mentioned management. How do you analyze the governance structure and the individual humans that are the managers of a company?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they answer questions, and ultimately their track record for doing what they say they're going to do. Do they under promise and over deliver? Do they over promise and under deliver? Do they say what they're going to do? Do they admit mistakes? Do they build great teams? Do people want to come work for them? Are they able to retain their talent? And then part of it is how much are they running the business for the benefit of the business? How much are they running the business for the benefit of themselves? And that's the analysis you do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are we talking about CEO, COO? What does management mean? How deep does it go?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was moved to California. And sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company is just to move it geographically, and then you can reboot the business. But a great leader has great followership. Over the course of their career, they'll have a team they've built that will come follow them into the next opportunity. But the key is really the top person matters enormously, and then it's who they recruit. You recruit an A-plus leader and they're going to recruit other A- type people. You recruit a B-leader, you're not going to recruit any great talent beneath them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned Warren Buffett. You said you admire him as an investor. What do you find most interesting and powerful about his approach? What aspects of his approach to investing do you also practice?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>low prices. Buffett's been great at that and great at teaching about what he calls temperament, which is this sort of emotional or unemotional quality that you need to be able to dispassionately look at the world and say, \"Okay, is this a real risk? Are people overreacting?\" People tend to get excited about investments when stocks are going up and they get depressed when they're going down. And I think that's just inherently human. You have to reverse that. You have to get excited when things get cheaper and you got to get concerned when things get more expensive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've been a part of some big battles, some big losses, some big wins. It's been a roller coaster. So in terms of temperament psychologically, how do you not let that break you? How do you maintain a calm demeanor and avoid running with a lemmings?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you when a stock price goes down or it has much less impact on you because again, as Mr. Graham said, the short term, the markets are voting machine. You have a bunch of lemmings voting one direction that's concerning. But if it's a great business, doesn't have a lot of debt and people are going to just listen to more music next year than this year, you know you're going to do well. So it's a bit some combination of being personally secure and also just knowing what you own and over time you build callouses, I would say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So psychologically, just as a human being, speaking of lines and gazelles and all this kind of stuff, is it as simple as just being financially secure? Is there some just human qualities that you have to be born with slash develop?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so. I think now I'm a pretty emotional person I would say, or I feel pretty strong emotions, but not in investing. I'm remarkably immune to volatility and that's a big advantage and it took some time for me to develop that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you weren't born with that, you think?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So being emotional, do you want to respond to volatility?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is going to be big, right? So we've made big mistakes. The good news is that the vast majority of things we've done have worked out really well. And so that also gives you confidence over time. But because we make very few investments, we own eight things today or seven companies of that matter, if we get one wrong, it's going to be big news. And so the other nature of our business you have to be comfortable with is a lot of public scrutiny, a lot of public criticism. And that requires some experience. I call it that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think we'll talk about some of that. Financially secure is something I believe also recommend for even just everyday investors. Is there some general advice from the things you've been talking about that applies to everyday investors?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and markets react very negatively to those kinds of events. And you can own the greatest business in the world trading for a hundred dollars a share, and next moment it could be 50. So as long as you don't borrow against securities, you own really high quality businesses and it's not money that you need in the short term, then you can actually be thoughtful about it. And that is a huge advantage. The vast majority of investors, it seems tend to be the ones that panic and the downturns get over related and when markets are doing well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So be able to think long-term and be sufficiently financially secure such that you can afford to think long-term.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now Buffett is the ultimate long-term thinker and just the decisions he makes, the consistency of the decisions he's made over time and fitting into that sort of long-term framework is a very, very educational, let's put it that way, for learning about this business.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned eight companies, but what do you think about mutual funds for everyday investors that diversify across a larger number of companies?<|eot_id|>"}

The famous Peter Lynch, Ron Barron, another great long-term growth stock investor. So there's some great mutual funds, but I put them in the handful versus the thousands. And if you're in the thousands, I'd rather someone bought just an index fund basically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, index funds.

And if you do that in a not particularly concentrated fashion and you don't borrow money against your securities, you'll probably do much better than your typical mutual fund.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's interesting.

When I was first investing, literally we had people faxing us documents from the SEC filings in Washington, D.C. Now everything's available online, conference call transcripts are free. You have AI, you have unlimited data and all kinds of message boards and Reddit forums and things where people are sharing advice and everyone has their own... By virtue of their career or experience, they'll know about an industry or a business and that gives them... I would take advantage of your own competitive advantages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm just afraid if I invest in Chipotle, I'll be analyzing every little change of menu from a financial perspective and just be very critical.<|eot_id|>"}

I want to tune out because if I'm at all tuned in, it has a negative impact on my life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's really important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain what activist investing is? You've been talking about investing and then looking at companies when they're struggling, stepping in and reconfiguring things within that company and helping it become great. So that's part of it, but let's just zoom out. What's this idea of activist investing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the 1920s, '30s, index funds with Vanguard and others, and that all these controlling shareholders gave their stock to society or their children and multiple generations. And they were no longer controlling owners of businesses or very few. And that led to under performance and the opportunity for activists over time. And what activism has done, and I think we've helped lead this movement, is it restored the balance of power between the owners of the business and the management of the company. And that's been a very good thing for the performance of the US stock market actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the owners meaning the shareholders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's a more direct channel of communication with activists investing between the shareholders and the people running the company?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. So activists generally never own more than five or 10% of a business. So they don't have control. So the way they get influence is they have to convince the other, but they have to get to sort of a majority of the other shareholders to support them. And if they can get that kind of support, they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder. And that's how it works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the running of companies, according to Bill Ackman is more democratic now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is. It is. But you need some thought leaders. So activists are kind of thought leaders. Because they can spend the time and the money. A retail investor that owns a thousand shares doesn't have the resources or the time, they got a day job. Whereas an activist day job is finding the handful of things where there are opportunities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So on average is a good to have such an engaged, powerful, influential investor helping control direct the direction of a company.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>valuable. But sometimes it's hard to have that kind of credibility when you're a new CEO of a company. So when you have a major owner that's respected by other shareholders sitting on the board saying, \"Hey, the CEO is doing the right thing and making this expensive investment in a new factory, we're spending more money on R&D because we're developing something that's going to pay off over time.\" That large owner on the board can help buy the time necessary for management to behave in a longer term way. And that's, I think, good for all the shareholders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the good story. But can it get bad? Can you have a CEO who is a visionary and sees the long-term future of a company and an investor come in and have very selfish interest in just making more money in the short term and therefore destroy and manipulate the opinions of the shareholders and other people on the board in order to sink the company, maybe increase the price, but destroy the possibility of long-term value?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of stock. The shareholder basis today, the biggest shareholders are these index funds that are forever, right? The BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, their ownership stakes are just at this point only growing because of the inflows of capital they have from shareholders. So they have to think or they should think very long-term and they're going to be very skeptical of someone coming in with a short-term idea that drives the stock price up in the next six months, but impairs the company's long-term ability to compete. And basically that ownership group prevents this kind of activity from really happening.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So people are generally skeptical of short-term activist investors?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and they're very few. I don't really know any short-term activist investors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a hopeful-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a good one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it wasn't a trade. I wouldn't describe it as a trade. A trade is something you buy and you flip.

We spun off of general growth and it's now 15 years later.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you describe what went into making that decision to actually increase the value of the company?<|eot_id|>"}

I called Maddie up and I said, \"Maddie, I need to get on the board of the company to help.\" And she says, \"You know what? I will call my cousin and I'll get it done.\" She calls back a few hours later, \"You'll be going onto the board.\" I don't know what she said because ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, she was convincing.<|eot_id|>"}

And he was still holding it. And he went into retirement and he made 50 times his money. And those are the moments that you feel pretty good about investing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gave you confidence through that?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the same thing. You just do the work. We got a lot of pushback from our investors actually because we had never invested in a bankrupt company before. It's a field called distressed investing, and they're dedicated distressed investors and we weren't considered one of them. \"Bill, what are you doing? You don't know anything about distressed investing.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I learned. And it sometimes is very helpful not to be a practitioner, an expert in something because you get used to the conventional wisdom. And so we just abstractly stepped back and look at the facts and it was just a really interesting setup for one of the best investments we ever made.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it to learn some of the legal aspects of this? Like you mentioned bankruptcy code. I imagine is very dense language and dense ideas and loopholes and all that kind of stuff.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not that hard. No, it's not that hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I literally read a book on distressed investing. Ben Branch or something on distressed investing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You were able to pick up the intuition from that. Just all the basic skills involved, the basic facts to know, all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}

And that one we did very well, but I missed the big opportunity and I suffered severe psychological torture every time I walked by Rockefeller Center because we knew more about that property, anyone else, but I knew less about deal making and didn't have the resources, and I was 28 years old or 27. And they hired a better lawyer than we did, and they outsmarted us on that one in a way. I said, \"Okay, I'm going to go hire this guy the next time round.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. We'll probably talk about Rockefeller Center and some failures, but first you said Fox in the henhouse, something that the board and the chairman were worried about. Why would they call you a fox?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's a million questions here, but first of all, what is the process of getting on the board look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and the materials they sent to shareholders and the shareholders pick the best ones. When we ran proxy contests in the past, that was not the case.

And then you got to run around and meet with the big shareholders, fly around the country, explain your case to them, and then there's a shareholder meeting. And if you get a majority of the votes, you get on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's this proxy contest/battle idea, what's the-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they overpaid management, they're subject to attack by shareholders. But these contests are not dissimilar to political contests, where there's mudslinging and the other side puts out false information about you and you have to respond and they're spending the shareholders' money, so they have sort of unlimited resources. And you're spending your and your investors' money, when you're a small firm, finite resources. They can outspend you, they can sue you, they can try to jigger the mechanics in such a way that you're going to lose. There's some unfortunate stuff that's happened in the past, some manipulative stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also some stuff that's public like in the press and all this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, of course. There'll be articles about ... In the dirty days where they would go through your trash and make sure that you're not sleeping around and things like this. But that's okay. I can survive extreme scrutiny because I've been through this for a long time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the fat and happy hens can get very wolf-like when the fox is trying to break in? Is this how we extend this metaphor?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the fox is a threat to the hens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the charismatic fox just explained to me why the fox is good for everybody in the henhouse.<|eot_id|>"}

He's got some decent ideas and let's all work together to have this work out.\" And so there are very few cases where after the contest ... And by the way, sometimes you have to replace the entire board. We've done that. But in most cases you got a couple of seats on the board, and it's just you want to build a board comprised of diverse points of view. And that's how you get to the truth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the most dramatic battle for the board that you have been a part of?<|eot_id|>"}

We're like, \"Okay, we've got a great asset. We've got the greatest railroad CEO of all time. He's come out of retirement to step in and run the railroad.\" And we brought him to the first meeting and they wouldn't even meet with him, and they certainly weren't going to consider hiring him. And that led us to a proxy contest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And this is where the engine starts churning to figure out how this contest can be won.

And then we put together our slate and we had some pretty interesting dialogue with the company. They tried to embarrass us all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the press publicly? What are talking about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Lau, other members of my team were super engaged. And Canadians are known to be nice, so one of the problems we had is shareholders would never tell management or the board that they were losing. It was not until the night before the meeting when the vote came in, that management realized that they lost. We got 99% of the vote. And they begged us to take a deal. They said, \"Look, we'll resign tonight so that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow.\" That's how embarrassed they were. But that was kind of an interesting one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In both this proxy battle and the company itself, this was one of your more successful investments?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>actually better than Hunter. He's doing an incredible job. And the sad part here is we did very well, we tripled our money over several years and then I went through a very challenging period because of a couple of bad investments, and we had to sell our Canadian Pacific to raise capital to pay for investors who are leaving. But we had another opportunity to buy it back in the last couple of years. And so we're now again a major owner of the company.

But the nonprofit entity, as I understand it, owns a big chunk of OpenAI, and the investors own a capped interest where their upside is capped and they don't have representation on the board. And I think that was a setup for a problem, and that's clearly what happened here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's, I guess some kind of complexity in the governance.

And what you see a lot in venture boards is they're presided over generally by venture capital investors who are big investors in the company. And oftentimes it's more important to them to have the public perception that they're good directors so they get the next best deal. If they have a reputation for taking on management too aggressively, word will get out in the small community of founders and they'll miss the next Google. And so their interests are not just in that particular company. That's also one of the problems. Again, it all comes back to incentives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain to me the difference venture backed VCs and shareholders?

That's kind of problematic. You don't have the same issue in public company boards.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We talked about some of the big wins and your a track record, but you said there were some big losses.

If there is principles which you want to see an institution become and embody in the next several decades, there's opportunities to do that. You, as a great leader, also need to have a sense of when is the opportunity to do that. October 7th really woke up the world on all sides, honestly. There is a serious issue going on here.

That Harvard of all places couldn't have a racially-diverse present. It sent an important message. So the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence on President Gay, and that it was a relatively quick process.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's just a bullshit test. And nothing that Neri did is plagiarism in the bad meaning of the word. Plagiarism right now is becoming another -ism, like racism or so on, used as an attack word. I don't care what the meaning of it is, but there's the bad academic fraud like theft, theft of an idea. And maybe you can say a lot of definitions and this kind of stuff. But then there's just a basic bullshit test where everyone knows, this is a thief and this is definitely not a thief. And there's nothing about anything that Neri did, anything in her thesis or in her life. Everyone that knows her, she's a rock star. I just want to make it clear, it really hurt me that the internet, whatever is happening, could go after a great scientist. Because I love science, and I love celebrating great scientists. And it's just really messed up that whatever the machine, we can talk about Business Insider or whatever, social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening. We need the great scientists of the world, because the future depends on them. And so we need to celebrate them, and protect them, and let them flourish and do their thing. And keep them out of this whatever shit-storm that we're doing to get clicks, and advertisements, and drama and all this. We need to protect them. So I just want to say there's nobody I know, and I have a million friends that are scientists, world-class scientists, Nobel Prize winners, they all love Neri, they all respect Neri, she did zero wrong. And then the rest of the conversation we're going to have about how broken journalism is, and so on. But I just want to say that there's nothing that Neri did wrong. It's not a gray area or so on. I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay is a discussion about plagiarism, because it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken, it becomes some weird technical discussion. But in case of Neri, did nothing wrong. Great scientist, great engineer at MIT and beyond. She's doing the cool thing now.<|eot_id|>"}

I had done it privately, I'd done it publicly on Twitter, on X. I laid out, I have a whole tech stream, a WhatsApp stream with the CEO of the company. And they doubled down, and they doubled down again. And so, I don't sue people lightly.

And we're going to make sure there's a real cost, reputationally and otherwise, to Business Insider and to Axel Springer. Because ultimately you got to look to the controlling owner. They're responsible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'll just say that you in this regard are inspiring to me for facing basically an institution that whole purpose is to write articles.
