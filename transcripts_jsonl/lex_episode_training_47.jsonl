Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter, and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in. For example, he was a central figure in the resignation of the President of Harvard University, Claudine Gay, the saga of which we discuss in this episode. This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now to you, friends, here's Bill Ackman. In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing, you mentioned a book, Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, as being formative in your life. What key lesson do you take away from that book that informs your own investing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>then you can really take advantage of the market because it's really here to help you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, speculation is just a bit like trading crypto, right? You're-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Strong words.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>right way to think about love. So investing is about basically building a model of what this business is going to produce over its lifetime.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you get to that, this idea called value investing? How do you get to the value of a thing? Even philosophically, value of anything really but we can just talk about the things that are on the stock market, companies.<|eot_id|>"}

And what is your process of figuring out whether a company is or isn't that?<|eot_id|>"}

If you can avoid losing money and then have a few great hits, you can do very, very well over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, music is interesting because yes, music's been around for a very long time, but the way to make money from music has been evolving. Like you mentioned streaming, there's a big transition initiated by, I guess, Napster, then created Spotify of how you make money on music with Apple and with all of this. And the question is, how well are companies like UMG able to adjust to such transformations? One, I could ask you about the future, which is artificial intelligence being able to generate music, for example.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There have been a lot of amazing advancements with...

And that's really the artists and the label.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I actually think AI is not going to be the primary creator of music. I think we're going to actually face the reality that it's not that music has been around for thousands of years, but musicians and music has been around.

Oh, and so you look at a company like Chipotle and then you see there's a difficult moment in its history, like you said that there was a food safety issue and then you say, \"Okay, well I see a path where we can fix this and therefore even though the price is low, we can get it to where the price goes up to its value.\"<|eot_id|>"}

You said a lot of really interesting qualities of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements that took less than 10 seconds to say, but some of them were... All of them were fascinating.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers around the country.

It's tricky to know with everything that's happening in AI... And I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon. It's interesting that you think that there's a moat. And it's also interesting to analyze it because as a consumer, as just a fan of technology, why is Google still around?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to support them. And if they can get that kind of support, they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the resources or the time, they got a day job. Whereas an activist day job is finding the handful of things where there are opportunities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So on average is a good to have such an engaged, powerful, influential investor helping control direct the direction of a company.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>board can help buy the time necessary for management to behave in a longer term way. And that's, I think, good for all the shareholders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the good story. But can it get bad? Can you have a CEO who is a visionary and sees the long-term future of a company and an investor come in and have very selfish interest in just making more money in the short term and therefore destroy and manipulate the opinions of the shareholders and other people on the board in order to sink the company, maybe increase the price, but destroy the possibility of long-term value?<|eot_id|>"}

I also felt like the leadership wasn't even part of the problem as much as they were almost out of touch, unaware that this is an important moment, it's an important crisis, it's an important opportunity to step up as a leader and define the future of an institution.

But it's not doing the job it should be doing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Neri Oxman, somebody you mentioned several times throughout this podcast, somebody I had a wonderful conversation with, a friendship with.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. W.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hat do you love about Neri? What do you admire about her as a scientist, artist, human being?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>remarkable people, and I'm incredibly fortunate to spend a very high percentage of my lifetime with her, ever since I met her six years ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So she's been a help to you through some of the rough moments you described.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure. I mean, I met her at the bottom. Which is not a bad place to meet someone if it works out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some degree of yin and yang with the two personalities? You have described yourself as emotional and so on, but it does seem the two of you have slightly different styles about how you approach the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the same ways. And she has more emotion, more elegance. She doesn't like battles, but she's very strong. But she's more sensitive than I am.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you are constantly in multiple battles at the same time, and there's often the media, social media, it's just fire everywhere.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the kind of activist I was earlier in my career. I think since October 7th, yes, I do feel like I've been in a war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you tell me the saga of the accusations against Neri?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>his name is going to come public shortly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to, I don't know. There's a lot of things I want to say. But you made it pretty clear. But just as a member of the community, there's also a common sense test. I think you're more precisely legal in looking at...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's just a bullshit test. And nothing that Neri did is plagiarism in the bad meaning of the word. Plagiarism right now is becoming another -ism, like racism or so on, used as an attack word. I don't care what the meaning of it is, but there's the bad academic fraud like theft, theft of an idea. And maybe you can say a lot of definitions and this kind of stuff. But then there's just a basic bullshit test where everyone knows, this is a thief and this is definitely not a thief. And there's nothing about anything that Neri did, anything in her thesis or in her life. Everyone that knows her, she's a rock star. I just want to make it clear, it really hurt me that the internet, whatever is happening, could go after a great scientist. Because I love science, and I love celebrating great scientists. And it's just really messed up that whatever the machine, we can talk about Business Insider or whatever, social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening. We need the great scientists of the world, because the future depends on them. And so we need to celebrate them, and protect them, and let them flourish and do their thing. And keep them out of this whatever shit-storm that we're doing to get clicks, and advertisements, and drama and all this. We need to protect them. So I just want to say there's nobody I know, and I have a million friends that are scientists, world-class scientists, Nobel Prize winners, they all love Neri, they all respect Neri, she did zero wrong. And then the rest of the conversation we're going to have about how broken journalism is, and so on. But I just want to say that there's nothing that Neri did wrong. It's not a gray area or so on. I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay is a discussion about plagiarism, because it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken, it becomes some weird technical discussion. But in case of Neri, did nothing wrong. Great scientist, great engineer at MIT and beyond. She's doing the cool thing now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Could not have said it better myself. Now, obviously I'm focusing the technical part...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. Because you have to be precise here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with the CEO of the company. And they doubled down, and they doubled down again. And so, I don't sue people lightly. And stay tuned.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're, at least for now, moving forward with...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fix it. And if we can fix it there, we can move on from this episode and hopefully avoid litigation. So that's where we are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know. You're smarter than me. There's technical stuff, there's legal stuff, there's journalistic stuff. But just, fuck you Business Insider for doing this. I don't know much in this world, but journalists aren't supposed to do that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>paying attention and they're going to want to see your work.\" And that's how I try to cheer her up. But I think it's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is true. And you're doing your job as a good partner, seeing the silver lining of all this. How is, just from observing her, how did she stay strong through all of this psychologically? Because at least I know she's pushing ahead with the work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>better now. But you can kill someone. You can kill someone by destroying their reputation. People commit suicide. People go into these deep, dark depression.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well my worry, primarily, when I saw what Business Insider was doing, is that they might dim the light of a truly special scientist and creator.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not going to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I also worry about others like Neri, young Neris, that this sends a signal that might scare them. And journalism shouldn't scare aspiring young scientists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a real cost, reputationally and otherwise, to Business Insider and to Axel Springer. Because ultimately you got to look to the controlling owner. They're responsible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'll just say that you in this regard are inspiring to me for facing basically an institution that whole purpose is to write articles. So you're like going into the fire.<|eot_id|>"}

Maybe you can correct me on this, but you've been a big supporter of various democratic candidates over the years, but you did say a lot of nice things about Donald Trump in 2016, I believe.<|eot_id|>"}
