And I've also gotten advice from friends who are super high performing and have a lot of kids. They'll say, \"Just don't overthink it. Start having kids.\" Let's go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not a big pack of wild boys, you have daughters and they can be a different form of chaos. Sometimes, the same form of chaos.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How many kids do you think you want?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's either two or five. Very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You have a brother?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and my sister's done an amazing job, and her dad's done a great job too. They both really put a lot into the family aspect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got a chance to spend time with a really amazing person in Peru, in the Amazon jungle, and he is one of 20 kids.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's mostly guys, so it's just a lot of brothers and I think two sisters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clod wars and all that stuff. It would be so strange to have a childhood without that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and I think more and more as we wake up to the negative aspects of digital interaction, we'll put more and more value to in-person interaction.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bucket list, I will probably move to a major city, not Los Angeles or San Francisco, in the next few years. New York City potentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those are all such different flavors of experiences.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it was. Okay, I get it, but listen, I've never lived there so for me, it'd be entirely new, and Schulz seems full of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is an energy to that city and he represents that, and the full diversity of weird that is represented in New York City is great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you walk down the street, there's a person with a cat on their head and no one gives a shit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and it's cool. There's stuff happening in these cities that's new and different. That's what youth is for. They're supposed to evolve, evolve things out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So amidst all that, you still have to get shit done. I've been really obsessed with tracking time recently, making sure I have daily activities. I have habits that I'm maintaining, and I'm very religious about making sure I get shit done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you use an app or something like that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, just Google sheets. So basically, a spreadsheet that I'm tracking daily, and I write scripts that whenever I achieve a goal, it glows green.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, just the fact that I got the workout done, so it's a check mark thing. So I'm really, really big on making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. So I have a rule for myself that I do a set of tasks for at least five minutes every day, and it turns out that many of them, I do way longer, but just even just doing it, I have to do it every day, and there's currently 11 of them. It's just a thing. One of them is playing guitar, for example. Do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do daily habits?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>book writing, researching a podcast, and just fight tooth and nail to stay off social media, text message, WhatsApp, YouTube, all that. Get something done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How long can you go? Can you go three hours, just deep focus?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If I hit a groove, yeah, 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's tough. For me, I start the day. Actually, that's why I'm afraid, I'd really prize those morning hours. I start with the work, and I'm trying to hit the four-hour mark of deep focus.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love it, and often report. I'm really, really deeply-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 01:38:27] Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's often torture actually. It's really, really difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>earlier, we just communicate as much as we need to and we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we put anything out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So including even creative decisions of topics to cover, all of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the other discussions, because I obsess. But yeah, you have to have a team of some sort, someone that you can run things by.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For sure, but one of the challenges, the larger the team is, and I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff, including engineering stuff, robotics, work, research, all of those interactions, at least for me, take away from the deep work, the deep focus.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Unfortunately, I get drained by social interaction, even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're an introvert.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, fundamentally an introvert. So to me, it's a trade off - getting done versus collaborating, and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration, without a great team, which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of, you wouldn't get anything really done. But as an individual contributor, to get stuff done, to do the hard work of researching or programming, all that kind of stuff, you need the hours of deep work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>alone. I think social media causes our brain to go the other direction. I try and answer some comments and then get back to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>After going to the jungle, I appreciate not using the device. I played with the idea of spending maybe one week a month not using social media at all.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was getting one that day, and then everyone came in and the dog came in and everyone was piled in. It was very sweet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people you gather with.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, and I was clothed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't, which is very weird. Yeah, yeah, the friends you surround yourself with, that's another thing. I understood that from ayahuasca and from just the experience in the jungle, is just select the people. Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw somewhere, Conor McGregor has this good line, I wrote it down, about loyalty. He said, \"Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with.\" That guy is, he's big on loyalty. All the shit talk, all of that, set that aside. To me, loyalty is really big, because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them, what else is life about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the time to try and understand you and understand people. People are complicated. I love that, so can you read the quote once more?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with. Yeah. So in that way, a hardship is a gift. It shows you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely, and it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's go get some food.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You're a one meal a day guy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I actually ate something earlier, but it was a protein shake and a couple of pieces of biltong. I hope we're eating a steak.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What do you think? How do you feel?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I was thinking you'd probably like it. I only did a half a piece and I won't have more for a little while, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A little too good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for talking once again, brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>me publicly, you've shown up for me in my home, in my life, and it's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love you, brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Love you too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you'll call it fate. Thank you for listening and I hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
