He is the host of the Huberman Lab podcast and is an amazing scientist, teacher, human being, and someone I'm grateful to be able to call a close friend. Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now, called Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body. This is the Lex Freeman podcast.

And I'll continue to go as long as it feels right, and I feel like I'm doing good in the world and providing good, but I'm already starting to scout talent. My company that I started with, Rob Moore, SciCom Media, there's a couple other guys in there too. Mike Blabac, our photographer, Ian Mackey, Chris Ray, Martin Phobes. We are a company that produces podcasts right now. That's Huberman Lab podcast, but we're launching a new podcast, Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And we want to do more of that kind of thing, finding a really great talent, highly qualified people, credentialed people. And I've got a new kind of obsession with scouring the internet, looking for the young talent in science, in health and related fields. And so will there be a final episode of the HLP? Yeah, I mean, [inaudible 00:03:19] cancer aside someday it'll be the very last, \"And thank you for your interest in science.\" And I'll clip out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I love the idea of walking away and not be dramatic about it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I think there's no higher celebration to be had at the end of one's career, if you can look back and be like, \"Hey, I've put some really important knowledge into the world. People made use of that knowledge.\" And guess what? You spawned all these other scientific offspring or sport offspring or podcast offspring. I mean in some ways we look to Rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasters, they paved the way. Rhonda Patrick, first science podcast out there. So eventually the baton passes, but fortunately right now everybody's active and it feels really good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also a different kind of way where you have somebody like Grisha, Grigori Perelman the mathematician who refused to accept the Fields Medal. So he's one of the greatest living mathematicians, and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the Fields Medal.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bob Dylan didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. Yeah, he probably grew in notoriety for that.

He earned that right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for the fame or the money. They're doing it because they love the art.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the Rick Rubin thing. You got to verb it through, download your inner thing. I don't think we've talked about this, this obsession that I have about how Rick has this way of being very, very still in his body, but keeping his mind very active as a practice. Went and spent some time with him in Italy last June, and we would tread water in his pool in the morning and listen to A History of Rock and Roll in a Hundred Songs. Amazing podcast, by the way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>forward at a higher rate. So this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active, very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report great ideas coming to them in the shower, while running. So it can be the opposite as well, where the body is very active and the mind is perhaps more on kind of like a default mode network, not really focusing on any one specific thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting. There's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians I've talked to. They talk about sleep deprivation and going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing. And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get rest.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and then you get sleep, you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep, you get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep. And Matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and creativity, sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series. There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep. People who are coming off cannabis often will suffer from insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping, they dream like crazy. Cannabis is a very controversial topic right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, I saw that. What happened? There's a bunch of drama around an episode you did on cannabis.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we did an episode about cannabis, talked about the health benefits and the potential risks. It's neither here nor there. It depends on the person, depends on the age, depends on genetic background, a number of other things. We published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online, so to speak. And then a clip of it was put to X, where the real action occurs as you know, your favorite [inaudible 00:11:13].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves that is X versus Instagram or YouTube. There was kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The PhDs and MDs, yeah?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There were people on our side. There were people not on our side. I mean, the statement that got things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals there's a high potential for inducing psychosis with high THC-containing cannabis. For certain individuals, not all. That sparked some issues. There was really a split. You see this in different fields. There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that in my opinion is not of the sort that you would use at a university venue, especially among colleagues, but that's fine. We're all grownups.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, for me, from my perspective, it was strangely rude and it had an air of elitism that to me, was it the source of the problem during Covid that led to the distrust of science and the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douchebaggery that I wish we would have a little bit less of.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the indicas and sativas are biologically different, et cetera. So we'll get down into the weeds, pun intended, during that one. And I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to a direct criticism online about scientific content in a way that really promoted the idea of inviting a particular guest. And so it's great. Let's get a guest on who is an expert in cannabis. I believe, I could be wrong about this, but he's a behavioral neuroscientist. That's slightly different training. But look, he seems highly credentialed. It'll be fun. And we welcome that kind of exchange.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I deeply-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I'm not being diplomatic, I'm just saying it's cool. He's coming on. And he was friendly on the phone. He literally came out online and was basically kind of like, \"F you. F this and F you.\" But you get someone on the phone, it's like, \"Hey, how's it going?\" And they're like, \"Oh, yeah, well.\" There was an immediate apology of like, \"Hey, listen, I came out. Normally I'm not like that, but online...\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, listen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's a little bit like jujitsu, right? People say all sorts of things, I guess. But if you're like, \"All right, well, let's go,\" then it's probably a different story.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not like jujitsu because in jujitsu, people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences are. Let me just say on mic and off mic, you have been very respectful towards this person, and I look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been. That said, to me, that guy was being a dick. And when you graciously, politely invited him on the podcast, he was still talking down to you the whole time. So I really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him, but I hope others don't do that. You are a positive, humble voice exploring all the interesting aspects of science. You want to learn. If you've got anything wrong, you want to learn about it. The way he was being a dick, I was just hurt a little bit, not because of him, because there's some people I really, really admire, brilliant scientists that are not their best selves on Twitter, on X. I don't understand what happens to their brain.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're willing to back it up, with knowledge in this case, we're not talking about physical altercation. He kept coming and he kept putting on conditions, \"How do I know you want this?\" And I was like, \"Well, you can record the conversation.\" \"How do I know you want that?\" \"Listen, we'll pay for you to come out.\" \"How do you know...?\" And eventually he just kind of relented. And to his credit, he's agreed to come on. I mean, he still has to show up, but once he does, we'll treat him right, like we would any other guest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you treat people really well, and I just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>X is an interesting one because it thickens your skin just to go on there. I mean, you have to be ready to deal with-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. But I can still criticize people for being douchebags, because that's still not good, inspiring behavior, especially for scientists. That should be sort of symbols of scientific thinking, which requires intellectual humility. Humility is a big part of that, and Twitter is a good place to illustrate that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>grow from that example. Well, I'll tell you that the podcasters that I'm scouting, it's their energy, but it's also how they treat other people, how they respond to comments. And we're blessed to have pretty significant reach. When we put out a podcast of someone else's podcast, it goes far and wide. So like a skateboard team, like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab, you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and that are collegial. Etiquette is lacking nowadays, but you're in the suit and tie. You're bringing it back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Bringing it back. You said that your conversation with James Hollis, a Jungian psychoanalyst had a big impact on you. What do you mean?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we start to really touch into our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take.

And interestingly, he also put forward this idea of what is, it's like, \"Get up, shut up, suit up,\" something like that. Get out of bed, suit up and shut up and get to work. He also has that in him, kind of a Goggins type mindset.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So be able to turn off all this self reflection and self-analysis and just get shit done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for whatever reason, that one's in the can and I feel really great about it.\" To me, it's the most important guest recording we've ever done in particular because he has wisdom. And while I hope he lives to be 204, chances are he's got another, what, 20, 30 years with us, hopefully more. But I really, really wanted to capture that information and get it out there. So I'm very, very proud of that one. And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him, young, old, male, female, whatever, and you're going to get something of value.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about this idea of the shadow? That the good and the bad that we repress, that hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves, that's there, you think there's an ocean that we don't have direct access to?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>away from the violent and harmful parts of their shadow. But I think spending time thinking about one's shadow, shadows is super important. How else are we going to grow? Otherwise, we have these unconscious blind spots of denial or repression or whatever the psychiatrists tell us. But yeah, it clearly exists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do. We have neural circuits for altruism, and no one's born without these things. In some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied. But I looking inward and recognizing what's there is key.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what Rick Rubin is accessing when he goes silent. Silent body, active mind. That's interesting. What is it for you? What place do you go to that generates ideas? That helps you generate ideas?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>post or how could this... So doing things that are about 15 degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access, I believe, the circuits for, in Tim's case, painting goes to songwriting. I think for Joni Mitchell, that was also the case, right? I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting. For Rick, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's listening to podcasts. I don't know. That's his business. Do you have anything that you like to focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, I'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence.

This was in 2010, I was visiting Columbia Medical School and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist, Richard Axel.

You will notice that in the day after you use it, sometimes your throat will feel a little spasm like you might want to cough once or twice. And so, if you're a singer or you're a podcaster or something, you have to do long podcasts, you want to just be mindful of it. But yeah, you're supposed to keep it in your cheek and here we go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it did make me intensely focused. In a way, that was a little bit scary because-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The nucleus basalis is in the basal forebrain. Nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out axons, little wires, that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere. When you focus on one particular topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually, we know that there's an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine released there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there. So it's an intentional modulation by acetylcholine. So with nicotine, you're getting a exogenous or artificial heightening of that circuitry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The time I had Tucker Carlson on the podcast, he told me that apparently it helps him, as he said publicly, keep his love life vibrant.<|eot_id|>"}

There's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years, Nature Neuroscience and elsewhere, showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep. Simple math problems but math problems nonetheless.

You get a set of questions and you don't get to really feel the human, expose the human to the light, and at the full... We talked about the shadow. The good, the bad, and the ugly. So I think there's something magical about two, three, four hours, but it doesn't have to be that long, but it has to have that feeling to it where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be strictly sticking to the question-and-answer type of feel, but just shooting shit, which Rogan is the best by far in the world at that.<|eot_id|>"}

Now, it's always full-spectrum light, but because of some atmospheric elements and because of the low solar angle, that difference between the different wavelengths of light is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to and signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism. At the core of our brain in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, we are wired to be entrained to the rising and setting of the sun.

When we're happy, we rarely think this is going to last forever, which is an interesting contrast in its own right.

So I was ready for that, to relax through it, and maybe because I'm quite good at that from knowing how to relax in all kinds of disciplines, playing piano and guitar when I was super young and then through jiu-jitsu, knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports, to be able to relax the body fully, just to accept whatever happens to you, that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love it, and often report. I'm really, really deeply-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 01:38:27] Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's often torture actually. It's really, really difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We talk multiple times per day, and in life, I've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that, and I certainly don't blame all of it on them, I've played my role. But in terms of picking business partners and friends to work with, Rob is just, it's been bullseye and Rob has been amazing. Mike Blabac, our photographer, and the guys I mentioned earlier, we just communicate as much as we need to and we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we put anything out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So including even creative decisions of topics to cover, all of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that we have and why on our website, and the decision, do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product? We've got ways with sponsors because of changes in the product. Most of the time, it's amicable, all good, but just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy. But I try and work mostly on content and my team's constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions, because I obsess. But yeah, you have to have a team of some sort, someone that you can run things by.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For sure, but one of the challenges, the larger the team is, and I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff, including engineering stuff, robotics, work, research, all of those interactions, at least for me, take away from the deep work, the deep focus.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Unfortunately, I get drained by social interaction, even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're an introvert.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, fundamentally an introvert. So to me, it's a trade off - getting done versus collaborating, and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration, without a great team, which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of, you wouldn't get anything really done. But as an individual contributor, to get stuff done, to do the hard work of researching or programming, all that kind of stuff, you need the hours of deep work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I used to spend a lot more time alone. That's on my bucket list, spend a bit more time dropped into work alone. I think social media causes our brain to go the other direction. I try and answer some comments and then get back to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>After going to the jungle, I appreciate not using the device. I played with the idea of spending maybe one week a month not using social media at all.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that and call the party, be the person to bring people together if it's not happening? That's something I've really had to learn, even though I'm an introvert, like hey, gather people together. You came through town the other day and there's a lot of people at the house. It was rad. Actually, it was funny because I was getting a massage when you walked in. I don't sit around getting massages very often but I was getting one that day, and then everyone came in and the dog came in and everyone was piled in. It was very sweet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people you gather with.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, and I was clothed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't, which is very weird. Yeah, yeah, the friends you surround yourself with, that's another thing. I understood that from ayahuasca and from just the experience in the jungle, is just select the people. Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw somewhere, Conor McGregor has this good line, I wrote it down, about loyalty. He said, \"Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with.\" That guy is, he's big on loyalty. All the shit talk, all of that, set that aside. To me, loyalty is really big, because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them, what else is life about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, well, hardship will show you who your real friends are, that's for sure, and we're fortunate to have a lot of them. It'll also show you who really has put in the time to try and understand you and understand people. People are complicated. I love that, so can you read the quote once more?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with. Yeah. So in that way, a hardship is a gift. It shows you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely, and it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's go get some food.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You're a one meal a day guy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I actually ate something earlier, but it was a protein shake and a couple of pieces of biltong. I hope we're eating a steak.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What do you think? How do you feel?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I was thinking you'd probably like it. I only did a half a piece and I won't have more for a little while, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A little too good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for talking once again, brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, thanks so much, Lex. It's been a great ride, this podcast thing, and you're the reason I started the podcast. You inspired me to do it, you told me to do it. I did it. And you've also been an amazing friend. You showed up in some very challenging times and you've shown up for me publicly, you've shown up for me in my home, in my life, and it's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love you, brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Love you too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you'll call it fate. Thank you for listening and I hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
