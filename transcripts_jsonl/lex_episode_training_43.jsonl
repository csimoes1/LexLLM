{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one. There's peaches on the cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were in August, Colorado peaches.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>then they don't taste so great, but damn are they so good in that moment and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Kimbal Musk, a long time entrepreneur and chef and author of a new cookbook called The Kitchen Cookbook, Cooking for Your Community. You should check it out. It is in fact the first cookbook I've ever owned. I've already made stuff from it and it's delicious. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Kimbal Musk. Growing up in South Africa, you said it was a violent place.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just kind of for my sneakers just on one foot just leaves a footprint behind me. And you just walk on.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everyone walked on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's an interesting point you make. Underlying the violence is a kind of philosophy that human life is disposable, the individual life is disposable. I mean, that underlies many ideologies. I grew up in the Soviet Union, the value of human life was lower there than in the United States. The value of the individual in the United States is really high. There's probably an index you can put together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Per nation, that's a really interesting way to put it because violence is much easier on a mass scale. Suffering, causing suffering on a mass scale is much easier when you don't value the human life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We'd have dinner with Black friends, friends with their family, and we were still pretty young and there was just a real joy to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you accept mortality, you can really enjoy life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>really put it that way, but I think that's right actually.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It does. Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you just head on accept that fact, you can just enjoy every single moment and let go of this attachment and just enjoy the moment.<|eot_id|>"}

That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a story that Walter Isaacson writes about where Elon got beat up pretty bad and you were there, and then you also had to watch your dad yell at Elon for an hour, calling him worthless, all those kinds of things.

You said that your dad was a roller coaster of affection and then verbal abuse. Walter Isaacson quotes Barack Obama who said, \"Someone once said that every man is trying to live up to his father's expectations or makeup for his father's mistakes, and I suppose that may explain my particular malady.\" Is part of that ring true for you?<|eot_id|>"}

Okay, look, don't do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's still the trauma of that. It has an effect on the human psychology and can permeate through time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>exactly. I like the term play with them because what you're not trying to do is shut the conversation down. You're also not trying to-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Talk down on me.<|eot_id|>"}

There's something about, you know when the animals gather to the water or whatever, this kind of experience where you're just like, \"All right, let's just acknowledge together that we need sustenance.\" And somehow that kind of grounds us to, we're just a bunch of descendants of apes here, just kind of grateful to be alive, frankly, and grateful to be consuming this thing which keeps us alive.

I think they're local from Austin. I don't know the depth of their personal experience of the different kinds of communists-like systems, but it was fascinating to listen to and then get to know them and the humanity, the weirdness, like the characters.

It's great, so I look forward to that. But you were saying you get to see humans in real life interact. That's one of the beautiful things over food. In the book you write, Picasso once said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\" Then you wrote that you believe food is the gift we give ourselves three times a day. Can you explain that? The gift nature of it.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is at night even. I can't imagine doing that in the day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it was wonderful. It took us a few weeks. I think three weeks maybe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First time across America?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the weirdest places. And actually, I would say, we didn't go to them.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a tow truck. You find the most wonderful people. When you're in a place of distress, people do want to take care of other people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They help you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they want to help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And especially when you're on a road trip, because I've taken a road trip across the United States, and there's a part of people where they really love that. I think part of them wants to do that also, wants to escape whatever the local struggles. Just whatever the mundaneness, the struggles of life are, a road trip is a kind of thing where you're like, you know what? I'm going to get away from it all and I'm going to experience life in the full epic Jack Kerouac way of seeing America. And the people. Not the tourist sites, just the humans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of course, one. We stopped at Mount Rushmore at night, which you can see nothing. We thought that was hilarious. We couldn't see Mount Rushmore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was like, well, we physically were here.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>literally just create a new spreadsheet and it will just, a macro would print it out. It was like a magic trick for these guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Incredible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I was like, \"We're going to have someone spend hundreds of hours doing something and now it's something you can do in a minute.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, if that doesn't fill you with excitement...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that doesn't move your needle, what the heck? And so I was really disappointed with the banking world.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>failure.\" It's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship, but if your whole family's entrepreneurs and you go in and you aren't good, I was really afraid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're going to have to face that failure every time you meet your family.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>from someone else. I was like, \"No, I'm going to prove that I can do this without your teachings,\" and I was going to fail.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you, that humility is essential for the entrepreneur, especially young.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people to help you course correct.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But what was it like? You mentioned and the first people to look at a map basically at directions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>something that people knew existed. This was something we discovered that it existed.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Totally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's like, \"Oh, okay, cool.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you see, maybe when you're one of the first humans to see that thing, you're like, \"Holy, shit.\"<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>essentially wanted our company and we were welcome to stay but you don't have to. And that feeling, that was a pretty rough feeling.

That's a fascinating story there, also fascinating on many levels, including the fact that the current social media company, formerly known as Twitter, is now called X. History has a rhyme to it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>inertia to them. So you go... This was being shot out of a cannon. And I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be real.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a very spaceship-like feeling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's like, \"Whoa.\" It's like the G-force pulls you back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>here.\" I think the real transformative thing for Tesla was the Model 3 when we were able to get the price down for the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that was also one of the most challenging periods...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh my God.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... For Tesla for you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Apple works. So our Model 3 today this year is better than last year.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And we upload over the air.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which was one of the things that people don't often acknowledge, it's over the air updates. It's like a revolutionary thing. It's not just the autopilot.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. It's an iPhone with wheels.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stop driving is a journey. It's not like there's a destination. It's a journey forever. So let's see where we are on the journey today.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's been a bit of a push and pull between you and Elon in terms of levels of optimism about deadlines and so on, timelines about when we'll arrive at the destination.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that destination is tomorrow or yesterday.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because I take that learning on the journey approach, whereas it's really frustrating if you're always, it has to be about the destination every time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The nice thing about destination, at least from my personal perspective as a programmer engineer, is it puts a little fire under you to get shit done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If there's a clear deadline of a destination, you feel the anxiety of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say that I still do that, but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a destination. It means it was a forcing function to get it out there.

That is incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's an interesting moment in the history of humanity that perhaps hopefully we'll become a multi-planetary species. But SpaceX is also a company. You invested in SpaceX, you were side by side with Elon through the highs and the lows, through the lows and the highs. So what were some memorable challenges? What were some low points...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... From the history of SpaceX?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That communal, vulnerable connection. Like we mentioned vulnerability earlier. The most vulnerable place, actually that's when you have some of your most beautiful meals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the descendants of apes gathering around some baked beans after watching a rocket explode.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gives you hope about the future of this whole thing we've got going on, humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we really can make a difference. But if you step back a little, things are actually getting better. It's just a bumpy ride.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and for those of us watching all of this, I think I would love to see more celebrating of the people that are helping, the people that have found their way of helping and just celebrating those people.<|eot_id|>"}
