{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There isn't one. It's more like when there is one, it really is one. There's peaches on the cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were in August, Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On that day, at that moment, that was best ingredient?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was the best, but that only lasts for a week and then they don't taste so great, but damn are they so good in that moment and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Kimbal Musk, a long time entrepreneur and chef and author of a new cookbook called The Kitchen Cookbook, Cooking for Your Community. You should check it out. It is in fact the first cookbook I've ever owned. I've already made stuff from it and it's delicious. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Kimbal Musk. Growing up in South Africa, you said it was a violent place. What are some formative moments that you remember from that time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Africa, people died, or people were killed. I saw someone killed in front of me. I was getting off a train and it's a very violent train known for violence. We were stupid kids. We didn't really listen to our parents. We went on this train and the doors opened and I had people trying to get off the train and in front of me, two Black people, one Black guy just stabbed this knife in the side of this other Black guy's head and you're like, \"What the fuck?\" And you just, I got to get off the train.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How old were you at this time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably 16 or 17. And I got to get off the train and everyone is trying to get me to get off because they're all behind me. So, I step off and I step into the pool of blood one foot, and then I just walk for about a hundred paces while the stickiness of the blood just kind of for my sneakers just on one foot just leaves a footprint behind me. And you just walk on. You just walk on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did the others walk on as well? Go to the concert.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everyone walked on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's an interesting point you make. Underlying the violence is a kind of philosophy that human life is disposable, the individual life is disposable. I mean, that underlies many ideologies. I grew up in the Soviet Union, the value of human life was lower there than in the United States. The value of the individual in the United States is really high. There's probably an index you can put together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Per nation, that's a really interesting way to put it because violence is much easier on a mass scale. Suffering, causing suffering on a mass scale is much easier when you don't value the human life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>element. When my cousin, Russ and I, again, we're stupid kids, we shouldn't be doing this, but we go into the townships where a lot of the violence would be happening, and we really didn't see most of the violence there. It was in these more protests and so forth. But there's a joy that also comes from lower value of human life. There's a real joy. Everyone was like, well, I mean it's beautiful. We'd have dinner with Black friends, friends with their family, and we were still pretty young and there was just a real joy to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you accept mortality, you can really enjoy life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can really enjoy life. I mean, I think that's actually quite a nice insight. I've never really put it that way, but I think that's right actually. I think you just chill out a bit, takes things a little less seriously.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because life does end for everybody.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It does. Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you just head on accept that fact, you can just enjoy every single moment and let go of this attachment and just enjoy the moment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do love that we all live longer and so forth, but we should live longer with the goal of joy and the goal of happiness and peace, not some form of misery that you choose to attach yourself to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maximize joy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maximize joy. That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a story that Walter Isaacson writes about where Elon got beat up pretty bad and you were there, and then you also had to watch your dad yell at Elon for an hour, calling him worthless, all those kinds of things. You said it was the worst memory of your life. What do you make of such cruelty? What do you remember from that time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>horrible. I think coming back to the point of low value of human life, they tried to kill him. There was no holding back, so I just watched someone... It wasn't just one, but there was a main person and then there was a few others that piled in. They tried to kill him in front of me. We were eating sandwiches on a staircase at the school, in outdoor staircase. They were not coming after me and I just had to watch and I couldn't help. It was one of the saddest, most difficult experiences. It was just awful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just like that, life can end.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If could have been you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think I've had a near death experience where I almost died. I was in 2010 and I think that... And I broke my neck and I can go into that story in a moment, but this was different. This comes back to the low value of human life part where if someone had killed my brother, if that person had beat him to death, which he was trying to do, life would've gone on. That's like an insane thought in an American, well maybe in some tough neighborhoods, but for the most part, it's another thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the brutality of that, the mundaneness of the brutality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It makes you think of all the places in the world that that's happening.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And all the beautiful people that just disappear.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but please go try another country,\" because not having that perspective or having a perspective that, I don't know, they'll catch up on their shoulder about the country that they're in. Okay, go try another country and then come back and tell me, pick any country. It doesn't have to be some very violent country. You go pick any country and you just realize that actually the world doesn't think the same way that America thinks, and you are going to just learn a perspective that I think gives you a better way to critique where we live in America.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's humbling. You said that your dad was a roller coaster of affection and then verbal abuse. Walter Isaacson quotes Barack Obama who said, \"Someone once said that every man is trying to live up to his father's expectations or makeup for his father's mistakes, and I suppose that may explain my particular malady.\" Is part of that ring true for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mistakes. I think that's actually, that one rings true for me. He was really [inaudible 00:09:59], but I'm not connected to him, but he taught me, the phrase I used to have was he taught me what not to do, so I still actually learned a lot. What kind of human not to be, what kind of actions not to take. And so that kind of closer to living up to his mistakes. But my father was such a train wreck that it's not really mistakes. It's like intentional actions of what not to do. Okay, look, don't do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's still the trauma of that. It has an effect on the human psychology and can permeate through time. So, it has probably complex indirect effects on who you are, the good and the bad.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>give me, which is when they're talking to me, I kind of just drift away. That just, I'm still looking at them, I'm still nodding, might even respond to them in their conversation, but I'm actually not there. And I've realized that actually that grew up because my father would just, verbal abuse is one way to say it. It is abuse, but it's more just verbal diarrhea for you for hours and constantly saying, \"Do you understand?\" He wants to make sure that I'm paying attention. So, I trained myself to look like I'm paying attention, but I'm not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To disappear to someplace.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I do that less and less over time, but I-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That path has been paved somewhere in your mind at childhood, so it could be easy to walk down it. You and Elon were close growing up, you're still close. What did you learn from each other? How did you compliment each other?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>gathering place and I love putting people together in person and I love to have vibrant debates and conversations. I've been doing that forever, including throwing fun parties and stuff where I bring people together and I really want people to have fun, but be vulnerable in not just silly partying, just actually let's all connect. The definition for me of a good party is people laugh and cry. I want to have people have an emotional connection. I go to Burning Man every year, and that is, there's no question you will cry at some point during Burning Man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No small talk.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No small talk. Yeah, exactly. No small talk. You're totally right on most parties, not parties, but most events you go to are like clubs, these sort of nightclubs. I never go to those. And my joke is why would I want to go to a place where I pay to shout small talk in the dark?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good line. That's what it feels like. The only reason I enjoy those places is the full absurdity of exactly that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. It's totally absurd.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are we doing? What is this? What is this life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My compliment for my brother was just bringing joy and social connection and he's an engineering genius. I've worked with him forever and we do compliment each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You just came out with a cookbook, by the way. Thank you for giving me my first cookbook. I feel legit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love that. Your first cookbook.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm going to keep it on the counter and it's going to give me legitimacy when anyone comes over. Hey, listen, I'm basically a chef now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When did you first fall in love with cooking?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pulled out a chicken and he said, \"This is the easiest recipe for you. Just put it on a pan in an oven, a hot oven.\" Because back then the ovens weren't necessarily like 400 degrees or 450 or whatever. \"And put it in a hot oven for one hour and enjoy.\" That was it. And so I went home and actually I also bought some french fries, I'll tell you that as well. I'm a kid, of course, I went french fries. So, the roast chicken with french fries and the chicken came out and it was just fantastic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely fantastic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's incredible, by the way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You didn't screw it up the first time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>First of all, I think that also kicks off the magic. If you screw it up and you're like, \"Oh, maybe this is not for me.\" So for me, it really did kick it off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You started out on a high note.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with my family. I mean, obviously we stay connected, we're very close, et cetera, but in no other way can we sit down and just talk about things or talk about whatever's on our mind or just to not even talk, just to be at the table together. And I've done that now through my whole life. My kids still for my family, and we will do gratitudes at the beginning of our meal. And it's just, I think what kept me cooking, what made my love of cooking so great was actually the fact that we would sit down-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... and be present with each other. And I'm also just horrible with that too, so I also get to be present.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is that about food that brings people together and not just together, but really together where you're paying attention? What is that? Why is it food? What else does that? Sometimes maybe alcohol can do that, which is a kind of food, I guess [inaudible 00:17:18]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and I'm just curious, just like, \"Tell me what, I'm not a Trump supporter, but tell me more.\" And actually it draws the conversation out because you're there for an hour or longer, so there's no rush to get the answer. And I think that's a big difference. I've had one time where just a couple months ago I had someone, I was sitting at the community table, we have a community table in the restaurant, and I didn't know him too well, but he asked me, did I know that 9-11 was a conspiracy and it didn't really happen?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It didn't happen? Yeah.;<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I was like, \"Huh.\" So, I was at 9-11, [inaudible 00:19:02] I was there physically there. So, it's like, nope.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Allegedly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no doubt in my mind. But I didn't want to interrupt what he had to say. I let him talk for five minutes, six minutes, seven minutes. Again, you're there for a while, so you're not in a rush to jump in and argue. And then I shared that I was there, and I think because I had been willing to listen to him, he was willing to listen to me. And I don't know if he changed his mind. Certainly doesn't change my mind, but it was actually a pretty cool conversation to get into each other's mind.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think you connect on a different level. Not on the level of the conspiracy, but on the level of basic humanity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's what you really connect on. And then it almost becomes interesting and fun that you can exchange ideas, even crazy ideas, out there ideas, and kind of play with them. We humans are good at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. I like the term play with them because what you're not trying to do is shut the conversation down. You're also not trying to-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Talk down on me.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah, exactly. This guys is, let me just be nice while I totally disagree with this person. You can do that for a few minutes. You can't do that for two hours.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's something about food that completely, I don't know, it must be evolutionary that it makes us vulnerable in a way that even just standing there for a prolonged period of time doesn't. There's something about, you know when the animals gather to the water or whatever, this kind of experience where you're just like, \"All right, let's just acknowledge together that we need sustenance.\" And somehow that kind of grounds us to, we're just a bunch of descendants of apes here, just kind of grateful to be alive, frankly, and grateful to be consuming this thing which keeps us alive. And in that context, you can talk about all kinds of stuff. You can discuss flat earth and enjoy it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>become vulnerable. And then it's something as simple as, \"What's the most fun thing you've done recently and what is the most fun thing you're looking forward to?\" I have gotten into, with those prompts, I've gotten into hours long discussions on God. I've gotten into hours long discussions on love. I've got into hours long discussions on anger. It's actually amazing when people are just asked a question, \" What's the most fun thing you've done lately?\" Well, why would anger come up? Well, actually, they're in a vulnerable place, so it'll just kind of come out of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you get to see this, you get to see this at the kitchen in you said Boulder, Denver, Chicago?<|eot_id|>"}

I think they're local from Austin. I don't know the depth of their personal experience of the different kinds of communists-like systems, but it was fascinating to listen to and then get to know them and the humanity, the weirdness, like the characters. I love it. One of the reasons I really love Austin, I decided to be here, is just the cliche thing of keep Austin weird. I mean, there's a lot of weird characters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love it.

We got to keep this place weird.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent. Which makes the restaurant seem great because you have all these characters come in. It's great, so I look forward to that. But you were saying you get to see humans in real life interact. That's one of the beautiful things over food. In the book you write, Picasso once said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\" Then you wrote that you believe food is the gift we give ourselves three times a day. Can you explain that? The gift nature of it.<|eot_id|>"}

And so what I choose to do is I choose to make it a gift to myself for each meal. And most of the time, the best gift is with friends, with family. We'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning with my daughter, or we'll have dinner with our family. To me, it's a gift we give ourselves three times a day at least, but for the most part, three times a day, let's make it a good one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What makes it a good one to you?

But there's still a little bit of tension as well in the background. And I think that's what restaurants do is a very, very subtle version of that. You're in a room with strangers and you're a little cluster. Okay, fine, you guys are connected in it, but you're in a room with strangers, and it's just something that adds that energy to the meal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

It's not just about the food you're making, but it's about the person's psychological state. And you'll do something that you'd know that was not done well. And their psychological state, they're just in a very happy place and they love it. And you're like, huh, interesting. That's not how I would've reacted to that dish. And then the other way around you're like I got that right and that person's just really unhappy today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And it's so hard to read humans because you have to... If you got it right, that can look a million different ways depending on the emotional rollercoaster that humans living through. I've been at some very low points and I've gone to a restaurant alone and just sitting there and be truly happy with just the zen aspect of it. And it was just a great steak or something like this and maybe two other people around me would look like I'm very unhappy just because I'm within myself.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>also great about a restaurant it goes beyond the one-time experience that you walk in and you have that experience, is the good bartenders they remember you. Oh, you were in a few months ago and this is kind of your thing. You might need a little time. And other people will come in, they want a conversation or other people come in and they're going through a divorce and they just want to be sad for a moment. Have a scotch. And it's like, it's amazing what you learn in the restaurant world to just be connected to humanity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What is that about bars? That's a different experience. You said the table, the communal.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>each other. Bars, you can sometimes do that, you can talk left and right, but you have the freedom to always break free. You can say, okay great, I'm going to go back to my meal. It's a friend you can turn on and off at any time because the bartender knows that. They're trained. If you want attention, I'm going to give it to you. If you don't, I'm going to stay away. If you want to be chatty, I'm going to be chatty. If you want to be completely in your head, I'll leave you in your head.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's also strangers next to you that you... There's a feeling with a bar that you're kind of alone together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And you can reach out, you can add some conversation or you can choose not to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can exit quickly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love going to a bar by myself after work. I might have a scotch, might even not even have alcohol, just have something and maybe I'll have a snack or something before dinner because I'm going to go home and have dinner with the family and that 20 minutes is just an amazing state change from daytime to nighttime. Whereas if I went straight home, I'm still in my head and I'm just trying to get grounded and I'm not as pleasant of a person. So that's another powerful use of a bar. It's just like a transition time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it would be remiss not to mention the other use of the bar, which is like when you're going through some shit in life and you just go. I mean that's the cliche thing, I've been somewhere-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Drowning your sorrows.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The real thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. But the bar makes the melancholy somehow rich and beautiful and you feel heard in the silence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. You feel heard. Like I said earlier, people going through a divorce, they don't know where else to go. These are mostly men. Sometimes women will do it, but mostly men will do this and women have other ways of processing it. But they want a place to be sad and want a place where they could feel comfortable talking about it if... They're certainly not going to go into too much detail, but they just want to say something and the bartender is there for them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you don't know where to go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You don't know where to go. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the bar... Yeah, you're right. For men especially is a place to just go and just, I don't know. What is that? What is that?<|eot_id|>"}

It was my restaurant, someone else's restaurant, I just take in the energy and it's so much better than being home and turn the TV on. No, no, no. I want to be out in the restaurant. I want to feel the energy of the town. The other thing that restaurants teach me is they're the front lines of the economy or what's a better word for it? Front lines of the energy of how things are going.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of a people's in general. It doesn't necessarily mean this part of town, but it could be the entire society.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. So you can go into a restaurant and I'll use a simple example and why is the restaurant empty? Ah, there's a football game going on and there's such a large number of people want to watch that game that the restaurant is quiet. Or it might be like another world series or something and you're like, wow, that's so interesting. You can actually watch in America, of course, American humanity, you can watch them move in their patterns just by being in the restaurant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then another time you might be in a restaurant and he's just jamming. It's a Monday night and you're like, what is the energy that created this on a Monday night and maybe even on a cold February, Monday night, what is it? And sometimes you can't find out but you can feel it. And it's my front lines of humanity that I also just really love about the restaurants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it could be empty, it could be full. Empty bars, there's a magic to those too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You could still feel that energy. I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I actually prefer empty bars than full ones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just you and the bartender. I mean some of my greatest experiences is just the quiet bar, just me and the bartender and they're doing their thing and they've seen so many... I've almost like through osmosis somehow feel the stories that that bartender has seen, has felt, has heard and all that kind of stuff. It's not to be sort of spiritual about it, but it seems like it's in the walls or something. Like there's the history is felt.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then some of these bars are actually very old and it's wonderful. There are many in Europe like this, but there's a couple in New York City, a few hundred years old and they're still operating nonstop for that long and man, you feel it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Let me ask you some questions about ingredients. What's your favorite ingredient to cook with?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For me, cooking is an art. So it'd be like asking me what's my favorite paint color to use. It's not that it isn't like there isn't one, it's more like when there is one, it really is one. There's peaches on the cover of this cookbook. Those peaches, those were in August, Colorado peaches. It just doesn't get any better than that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On that day, at that moment, that was the best.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was the best, but that only lasts for a week and then they don't taste so great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But damn are they so good in that moment and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They look really good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They are so good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your favorite fruit? I love veggies and fruit. What's your favorite fruit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love a smoothie bowl, so I do sort of berries, raspberries, but I use fruit more in the form of a smoothie bowl than I eat fruit that often.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A good apple is pretty great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For me it's a problem, I think. Probably cherries number one. Probably, what are they called? Granny Smith apples number two.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah, those are great. But try it when sometime come to Colorado in August and when you try those peaches, it is like it heaven has arrived in your mouth. It is so ridiculously good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But just for a week in August.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just for a week. You can't have it all year long.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. What about veggies? You wrote that Chef Hugo that you worked with the co-founder of The Kitchen with taught you the power of a good vegetable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the power of good vegetable?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>roast them for dinner. So it's the appreciation for vegetables in general. I probably would say carrots is my favorite just because that was an example of one where I've really had to learn how to use the different types of carrots that come from all of our farms. And it's fun. It's a fun ingredient. If you just went to the whole foods or just went to a grocery store and you just got exactly the same carrot every time, less fun. But go to a farmer's market and see what you get and you'll see they're quite different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, carrot for me is probably number one. I have rigorous detailed rankings for fruit and veggies.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But we'll get into it. No, I'm just kidding. Well, I am the kind of person that would have a spreadsheet for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I'm mostly just making fun of myself. But I do love carrots. I wish they weren't so full of carbs, but...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I'm just not anti carbs. I think the-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Anti carb. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

Most of the time, okay, find some crummy bread, whatever. I can skip that part, but I find all of these diets that are like, no, none of this will work. Super this, super that. I wonder if they're just like people are just looking for something to hang on to. But these diets have been around forever and if they work, then we would know that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think one of the biggest problems with diets is it adds stress when you do have that perfect bowl of pasta. If you have categorized yourself as a low-carb eating person, you might be very stressed about enjoying this thing when you should just let go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let go. This is your cheat day or whatever.

I would say for me there's things that make me feel really good, but they're not rules. They're not... They're like go-to favorites in terms of diet and so on. For example, I've mostly been eating once a day for the longest time, but that's not a rule. It's completely flexible and I've mostly been eating very low-carb.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but you must be eating a lot of food in that one meal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, because it's usually a very sort of meat heavy. It's not, portions are not that big.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure, but your body needs food.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, body needs food.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

But like you said, I deviate. I'm more afraid of missing the perfect dessert, the perfect breakfast, the perfect bowl of pasta, pizza, all that kind of stuff. I don't think of it as a cheat day.

It's so sad that he chose to end his life, but I also had met with him a few times. Not like one-on-one over dinner or anything, but just met with him and I just felt his love for food and truly just love for food.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He gave the advice of don't be afraid, get excited, and cook with love.<|eot_id|>"}

I know when that expert person did not put love into double checking the dish before putting it on the table. You just know and cook with love is you do it for your family. Oh, actually, especially when you do it for your family. The food doesn't have to be perfect, but you're cooking with love.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why you lost scrambled eggs.<|eot_id|>"}

You are allowed to drop out at any time. You don't get your money back. 25 people started, six people graduated, and the people who graduated, I graduated, but man, there were times where I'm like, I can't handle this. I would literally say to my friends, \"Oh, I got to go to cooking school. I'm going to go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours.\" And I had this little French chef who was my nemesis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does he still live in your head somewhere?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He still lives in my head. Exactly. He totally does. He's like five foot two or something.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>someone else and started screaming at them saying that, look, even Kimbal can do this and you can't do this. And I was like, this whole thing's like a psycho game. So it did take the edge off when I realized it was... The guy was intentionally trying to break you down. And they do this apparently in the army. I've not been to the army, but they need to break you down. Everything you know is worthless so that then we can teach you and you can come out of it with what actually we want you to know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are there specific technical lessons you remember you learned from that, sort of how to cut carrots or how to approach food, how to prepare food, how to think about food, how to carry yourself in the kitchen?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one of the things he wanted to teach was how do you make an omelet, a French omelet, and it's really fundamentally the same thing. It's a soft scrambled eggs that you fold and the love that he put into the time with us. And of course he's a legend. There were moments like that where I'm like, wow, okay. Also, just like the other chefs, he didn't have any concern berating anyone. So he berated our master chefs saying, \"I don't trust these people to teach you how to make scrambled eggs, so I'm going to do it instead.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you speak to that? Because a lot of people here in this would be like scrambled eggs. Why do you need to be a master chef to really make scrambled eggs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, first of all, for me, and it's a learning journey forever. So I make scrambled eggs. I must have made it 10,000 times or more, whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's like Jared dreams of sushi, Kimbal dreams of scrambled eggs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pretty much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}

If you look up for a second, you're going to miss the perfect moment where you have to stop and get those eggs out of the pan because the eggs will keep cooking. And so it's this meditation. And sometimes you hit it perfectly, but most times could have been a little softer, could have been a little firmer, could have been a little bit more salt, could have been a little bit of pepper. And so what's really fun about the morning is my kids are kind of into it so we critique the eggs every morning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do they have a rating system? We're back to the spreadsheet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's more like, and again, it also comes back to how do people feel. So my kids can be in a bad mood and they can be grumpy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Or it's like a Michelin star system. What?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no. It's more like, oh yeah, I like my eggs a little more gooier or yesterday it was this way, but a little bit more salt, a little less salt. Salt is usually the one that is... Because not all salts are equal. So if you are used to working with a certain kind of salt and then you just are forced for some reason to... You ran out of salt so you use some other salt, you actually don't know how to use it. You really want to have the same salt all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You have a page on salt in the book, which is fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it over and over and over again. And it will teach you how to use that salt, whereby your own palate will tell you how salty you like things. But if you change it up and you mix up a whole bunch of salts, you've now multiplied your learning path. So for me, my favorite salt is kosher salt. And I like to use that all the time. And if I ever change it, I might sprinkle a little bit of Maldon salt, just a crunchy sort of a flaky salt. But it's more for that when you're actually eating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For the texture.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it gives you texture as well as salt. Exactly. You wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs, but if you switch out your salts, it's a different weapon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You need to learn it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I like how usually there's wine connoisseurs.

Do you think you need more or do you need it less? Okay, now next time put a little more on it because you can see it.

And sometimes it is actually pretty good to have 100% grass fed. I've had some amazing ranchers that show me that the flavor is all there. For the average person that might go to Whole Foods or a grocery store, I think the simplicity of a good steak, it is important to get good sourcing, but also it's just good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your favorite kind of meat?

I like the fact that it's lean, but if you want the fat, you can dive into that little strip of fat or you can leave it alone because you don't want it that night. It's also a great steak for adding something, if you want. You could either do a pepper sauce or you could do a lot of ground pepper, which it's not sauce, but it's a peppery steak.

The other trick with cooking a steak is don't touch it. You just put one side when you're ready to turn it, turn it around. Don't touch it any other time. But at the end, you take a dab of butter and you crush a clove of garlic. You don't even chop it, you just crush the clove, and you put the two of them in the pan and you just roll the steak around in the garlic butter.

We use these things 10 times a day now. It was amazing. And we were the first two humans to see it on the internet because this stuff didn't even exist to the world. Navtech was building it for NeverLost, for Hertz NeverLost, which would come out a few years later. This was not something that people knew existed. This was something we discovered that it existed. Let's put it on the internet and share it with the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did the two of you feel like to see that magic? Did you know...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's amazing. It was like, \"What?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you mean the amazing, just that it's cool, but also that you could see the future that this could transform...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think people understand before this moment, you could not be told your directions. You just could not. Today, we live in this world where you're told our directions all the time. Before this moment you could not be told your directions and all of a sudden you could. It wasn't like a little thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a bunch of things that once we have, we take it for granted. And that takes a day for people to transition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Totally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's like, \"Oh, okay, cool.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Right. Exactly. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you see, maybe when you're one of the first humans to see that thing, you're like, \"Holy, shit.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Holy shit. This is going to be used by everyone all the time forever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Zip2 was a success.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work was through folks like The New York Times. So we were even much, much busier than that. But there was just no money at it. And even today, go to Google Maps, there's no money in it. It's just a local search that is needed for everyone. And so it became an add-on to search. But even remember in those days, you couldn't make money at search either. No one had figured out AdWords or anything, they didn't realize how big of a business this was. But we all knew this was a thing and everyone was using it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But didn't quite know how to make money on it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>best search engine at the time, pre-Google with Zip2, which would be the best local search, and it would be a Yahoo killer. And the Compact just wanted to make money by taking the company public but they wouldn't give us any stock. They paid us cash return out, actually very well for us, but because the whole internet bubble burst, we didn't know that at the time. And so it was bittersweet because they essentially wanted our company and we were welcome to stay but you don't have to. And that feeling, that was a pretty rough feeling. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But in retrospect, it opened the door to...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It set us up for an incredible platform to go do beautiful things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've invested in X. com that eventually merged with PayPal. That's a fascinating story there, also fascinating on many levels, including the fact that the current social media company, formerly known as Twitter, is now called X. History has a rhyme to it. It's kind of all hilarious in a certain kind of way. You invested in and help sell a lot of the initial products for Tesla.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I still sell on the board of Tesla. Tesla is 20 years now. Isn't that amazing?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>20 years.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From the Roadster, the initial Roadster to...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I still have the first business plan. So I didn't join as a founder, I joined as a founding board member. And so I actually, I didn't write the business plan. I got to read it and I still have that. I still have it as a part of history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you see the future at that time, the company that Tesla is today? Could you have possibly, could you and Elon imagine it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>drive train and I drove it. Even the dashboards, there's no dashboard. It's just you got a steering wheel and it's just wires and everything around. And I remember there's a street, we were running the Bay Area called Bing Street, and I was just like... No traffic. So I'm just going to drive this on the floor and see what happens. And it was a feeling I'd never experienced before. Gasoline cars have an inertia to them. So you go... This was being shot out of a cannon. And I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be real.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a very spaceship-like feeling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's like, \"Whoa.\" It's like the G-force pulls you back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be great. This is going to be an interesting... We are going to create something interesting here.\" I think the real transformative thing for Tesla was the Model 3 when we were able to get the price down for the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that was also one of the most challenging periods...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh my God.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... For Tesla for you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we'd get that done. The Model 3 today is incredibly affordable car, like a 300 bucks a month kind of lease and $3,000 down. That's where you get the scale. That's where you get people who... And by the way, it's a great car. It's even a better Model 3 now than it was five years ago. We don't function the way car companies function. We function more like how an iPhone company or how Apple works. So our Model 3 today this year is better than last year. It's like it's way better and we just keep getting better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and the software is a fundamental part of the car and the software keeps improving.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And we upload over the air.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which was one of the things that people don't often acknowledge, it's over the air updates. It's like a revolutionary thing. It's not just the autopilot. To me, it's like the over the updates, is even bigger thing than on the autopilot, at least in this moment of history because you basically turned a car into the iPhone.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. It's an iPhone with wheels. But actually talking about autopilot, right after this interview, I'm going to go test out the latest Model 3.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're going to get driven around by a robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm going to get driven around by the car. I'm going to say, \"I want to go to this barbecue joint. Take me there and park me there.\" And I'm going to see how it is. And this is the latest Model 3 that we have out into production. Anyone can buy it. And it's super affordable. And it's like, \"Okay. Full stop driving is a journey. It's not like there's a destination. It's a journey forever. So let's see where we are on the journey today.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's been a bit of a push and pull between you and Elon in terms of levels of optimism about deadlines and so on, timelines about when we'll arrive at the destination. I like that you said it's a journey. For Elon, there's a destination, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that destination is tomorrow or yesterday.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that's a really good insight. I actually live with this concept of a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset. And it's a philosophical term where fixed mindset is about the destination and a growth mindset is about learning on the journey. And I think that I'm a happier person because I take that learning on the journey approach, whereas it's really frustrating if you're always, it has to be about the destination every time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The nice thing about destination, at least from my personal perspective as a programmer engineer, is it puts a little fire under you to get shit done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If there's a clear deadline of a destination, you feel the anxiety of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say that I still do that, but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's true.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Because you're just forcing people to crank on some code or cookbook or whatever because you have a date. And oftentimes there's reason. It's 20th anniversary, you wanted to get the cookbook out. We have a reason we didn't make this up out of thin air. And so yeah, that does push you, but just because we have the cookbook doesn't mean it's a destination. It means it was a forcing function to get it out there. Now we're on the journey.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of journeys, I have to ask you about SpaceX. The journey that all of humanity [inaudible 01:40:00]<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Seriously. Talk about a journey. That is incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's an interesting moment in the history of humanity that perhaps hopefully we'll become a multi-planetary species. But SpaceX is also a company. You invested in SpaceX, you were side by side with Elon through the highs and the lows, through the lows and the highs. So what were some memorable challenges? What were some low points...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... From the history of SpaceX?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just put the big pot in the middle and we had our little paper plates and we took a scoop as we needed it. And it was... Do we need the gathering place of food brings people together in the most difficult times, and it was one of my favorite memories because I was able to bring my gift to this group of incredible people that their hearts were broken. And to sit there and share a meal and feel the life kind come back into us and by the end of the night, we're actually having a good time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What a fascinating contrast of rockets representing the peak accomplishment of human beings as a society and then returning to the thing that is the foundation of human society, which is that communal experience.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That communal, vulnerable connection. Like we mentioned vulnerability earlier. The most vulnerable place, actually that's when you have some of your most beautiful meals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the descendants of apes gathering around some baked beans after watching a rocket explode.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gives you hope about the future of this whole thing we've got going on, humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about hope. It's more perspective and reflection. And if I do see a problem, like in case of the obesity epidemic, I work really hard to help with that. Our nonprofit's called Big Green and we work with 150 nonprofits around the country to help Americans grow food again, get connected to their food because I really believe growing food changes your life. And so, \"Okay, let's go do that.\" So I'll help out where I think we really can make a difference. But if you step back a little, things are actually getting better. It's just a bumpy ride.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and for those of us watching all of this, I think I would love to see more celebrating of the people that are helping, the people that have found their way of helping and just celebrating those people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are constantly facing death. Why should you even exist? Do your customers want your product or whatever? And then something will happen where you're like, \"Wow, we really nailed that. That's really great.\" Or we got a product released or got some good kudos from something, right? Everyone, we're going to go celebrate. And actually everyone's still like, \"No, no, we've got all these other problems.\" Nope, we're going to go celebrate and then we'll go back to the problems. But if you don't do that, then it starts building on this kind of... You never really get to celebrate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. And be grateful. I think this is a good time to go celebrate the very fact that we're alive today. We get to live and enjoy this incredible life, the two of us, and have this great conversation, and we'll get to celebrate over some scrambled eggs.<|eot_id|>"}
