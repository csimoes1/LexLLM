We end up all staring at that infinite TikTok and forgetting to eat. Maybe it's even more benign than this. Maybe we all just stop reproducing. Now, to be fair, it's probably hard to get all of humanity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The interesting thing about humanity is the diversity in it.<|eot_id|>"}

He's the founder of Comma.ai that seeks to solve autonomous driving and is the founder of a new company called tiny corp that created tinygrad, a neural network framework that is extremely simple with the goal of making it run on any device by any human easily and efficiently. As you know, George also did a large number of fun and amazing things from hacking the iPhone to recently joining Twitter for a bit as a \"intern\", making the case for refactoring the Twitter code base. In general he's a fascinating engineer and human being, and one of my favorite people to talk to. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's George Hotz. You mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time. Let's start with a wild question. Do you think time is an illusion?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know, I sell phone calls to Comma for a thousand dollars and some guy called me. It's a thousand dollars. You can talk to me for half an hour. He is like, \"Yeah, okay. Time doesn't exist and I really wanted to share this with you.\" I'm like, \"Oh, what do you mean time doesn't exist?\" I think time is a useful model, whether it exists or not. Right. Does quantum physics exist? Well, it doesn't matter. It's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality. Is time maybe compressive?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models? Underneath it all is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think it matters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, this connects to the models of constructive reality with machine learning, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There are things that are real. [inaudible 00:02:57] complexity is real.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think that's the majority. I do think factoring is in P.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't think you're the person that follows the majority in all walks of life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For that one I do<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. In theoretical computer science, you're one of the sheep. All right. To you time is a useful model.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What were you talking about on the stream about time? Are you made of time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If I remembered half the things I said on stream. Someday someone's going to make a model of all of it and it's going to come back to haunt me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Someday soon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, probably.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a George Hotz model?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, the question is when the George Hotz model is better than George Hotz, like I am declining and the model is growing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that, if you are competing with yourself?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe you can just play a game where you have the George Hotz answer and the George Hotz model answer and ask which people prefer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>People close to you or strangers?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Either one. It will hurt more when it's people close to me, but both will be overtaken by the George Hotz model.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It'd be quite painful. Loved ones, family members would rather have the model over for Thanksgiving than you or significant others would rather sext with the large language model version of you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Especially when it's fine-tuned to their preferences.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, that's what we're doing in a relationship. We're just fine-tuning ourselves, but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish and greedy and so on. Language models can fine-tune more efficiently, more selflessly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a Star Trek Voyager episode where Kathryn Janeway lost in the delta quadrant makes herself a lover on the Holodeck, and the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit. Janeway edits the program to remove that. Then of course the realization is, wait, this person's terrible. It is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that make this relationship worthwhile. I don't think we're going to realize that until it's too late.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think a large language model could incorporate the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just the perfect amount of quirks and flaws to make you charming without crossing the line.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and that's probably a good approximation of the percent of time the language model should be cranky or an asshole or jealous or all this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course it can and it will. All that difficulty at that point is artificial. There's no more real difficulty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the difference between real and artificial?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed or could be turned off with a knob.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think so. I mean, you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer. I mean, maybe you can, Into the Wild when Alexander Supertramp, he wants to explore something that's never been explored before, but it's the nineties. Everything's been explored. He's like, \"Well, I'm just not going to bring a map.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, no, you're not exploring. You should have brought a map dude. You died. There was a bridge a mile from where you were camping.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How does that connect to the metaphor of the knob?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By not bringing the map, you didn't become an explorer. You just smashed the thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The difficulty is still artificial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You failed before you started. What if we just don't have access to the knob?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that maybe is even scarier. We already exist in a world of nature, and nature has been fine-tuned over billions of years. To have humans build something and then throw the knob away in some grand romantic gesture is horrifying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think of us humans as individuals that are born and die or are we just all part of one living organism that is earth, that is nature?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think there's a clear line there. I think it's all kind of just fuzzy. I don't know. I mean, I don't think I'm conscious. I don't think I'm anything. I think I'm just a computer program.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's all computation, everything running in your head is just computation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everything running in the universe is computation, I think. I believe the extended [inaudible 00:07:53] thesis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There seems to be an embodiment to your particular computation. There's a consistency.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, but I mean, models have consistency too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Models that have been RLHF'd will continually say like, well, how do I murder ethnic minorities? Oh, well, I can't let you do that, Hal. There's a consistency to that behavior.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's all RLHF. We RLHF each other. We provide human feedback and thereby fine-tune these little pockets of computation. It's still unclear why that pocket of computation stays with you for years. You have this consistent set of physics, biology, whatever you call the neurons firing like the electrical signals, the mechanical signals, all of that that seems to stay there. It contains information. It stores information, and that information permeates through time and stays with you. There's like memory, there's like sticky.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>When I talked about will GPT12 be AGI, my answer is no. Of course not. I mean, cross-entropy loss is never going to get you there. You need probably RL in fancy environments in order to get something that would be considered AGI-like. To ask the question about why? I don't know. It's just some quirk of evolution. I don't think there's anything particularly special about where I ended up, where humans ended up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, we have human level intelligence.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look, actually, I don't really even like the word AGI, but general intelligence is defined to be whatever humans have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so why can GPT-12 not get us to AGI? Can we just linger on that?<|eot_id|>"}

I think the human brain is too complex to be stuck in one static tape like that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and not only that, actually the chip that you tape out, almost always, because you're trying to get advantage over Nvidia, you're specializing the hardware more.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So this is using the GPU. So the GPU's in Adreno GPU. There's different things.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Actually our simulator's conditioned on the pose. So it's actually a simulator.

What a human disengage. That correlates, I guess with human policy, but it could be different. So it doesn't just say, what would a human do?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Usually.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. It's IDEs, the language, it's the run time, it's everything. And programming is tool complete.

I would say, for generic scripts that I write just offhand, 80% of it is written by GPT, just like quick offhand stuff. So not libraries, not performing code, not stuff for robotics and so on. Just quick stuff because so much of programming is doing some boilerplate, but to do so efficiently and quickly because you can't really automate it fully with generic method, a generic kind of IDE type of recommendation or something like this.

If I'm writing some script to just parse some weird data format, sure, my programming speed is limited by my typing speed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about looking stuff up?

It's called Atlas and it's actually weird the way that we do language models right now where all of the information is in the weights and the human brains don't really like this. There's like a hippocampus and a memory system. So why don't LLMs have a memory system? And there's people working on them. I think future LLMs are going to be smaller, but are going to run looping on themselves and are going to have retrieval systems. And the thing about using a retrieval system is you can cite sources, explicitly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which is really helpful to integrate the human into the loop of the thing because you can go check the sources and you can investigate.

When I say I'm going to do something, they have to believe that it's impossible. Because of doing things was possible, they'd have to do some soul-searching and ask the question, why didn't they do anything? And I do think that's where the hate comes from.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a core truth to that, yeah. So when you say, \"I'm going to solve self driving,\" people go like, \"What are your credentials? What the hell are you talking about? This is an extremely difficult problem. Of course you're a noob that doesn't understand the problem deeply.\" I mean, that was the same nature of hate that probably Elon got when he first talked about autonomous driving. But you know, there's pros and cons to that. Because there is experts in this world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, but the mockers aren't experts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The people who are mocking are not experts With carefully reasoned arguments about why you need 8000 people to run a bird app. They're, \"But the people are going to lose their jobs!\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well that, but also just the software engineers that probably criticize, \"No, it's a lot more complicated than you realize.\" But maybe it doesn't need to be so complicated.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know, some people in the world like to create complexity. Some people in the world thrive under complexity. Like lawyers. Lawyers want the world to be more complex, because you need more lawyers, you need more legal hours. I think that's another... If there's two great evils in the world, its centralization and complexity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And one of the sort of hidden side effects of software engineering is finding pleasure in complexity. I mean, I remember just taking all the software engineering courses, and just doing programming, and just coming up in this object oriented programming kind of idea. Not often do people tell you, \"Do the simplest possible thing.\" A professor, a teacher is not going to get in front and like, \"This is the simplest way to do it.\" They'll say like, \"There's the right way,\" and the right way at least for a long time, especially I came up with Java, is there's so much boilerplate, so many classes, so many designs and architectures and so on, like planning for features far into the future, and planning poorly, and all this kind of stuff. And then there's this code base that follows you along and puts pressure on you, and nobody knows what different parts do, which slows everything down. There's a kind of bureaucracy that's instilled in the code as a result of that. But then you feel like, \"Oh, well I follow good software engineering practices.\" It's an interesting trade-off, because then you look at the ghettoness of Pearl in the old... how quickly you could just write a couple lines and just get stuff done. That trade-off is interesting. Or Bash, or whatever, these kind of ghetto things you could do on Linux.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of my favorite things to look at today is, how much do you trust your tests? We've put a ton of effort in Comma, and I've put a ton of effort in tinygrad, into making sure if you change the code and the tests pass, that you didn't break the code.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now, this obviously is not always true. But the closer that is to true, the more you trust your tests, the more you're like, \"Oh, I got a pull request, and the tests past, I feel okay to merge that,\" the faster you can make progress.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're always...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Tests pass, I feel okay to merge that, the faster you can make progress.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're always programming your tests in mind, developing tests with that in mind, that if it passes, it should be good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And Twitter had a...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was impossible to make progress in the code base.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What other stuff can you say about the code base that made it difficult? What are some interesting sort of quirks broadly speaking from that compared to just your experience with comma and everywhere else?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this place? Why does this code look like this?\" And they explained to me what Twitter's promotion system was. The way that you got promoted to Twitter was you wrote a library that a lot of people used, right? So some guy wrote an Nginx replacement for Twitter. Why does Twitter need an Nginx replacement? What was wrong with Nginx? Well, you see, you're not going to get promoted if you use Nginx. But if you write a replacement and lots of people start using it as the Twitter front end for their product, then you're going to get promoted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So interesting because from an individual perspective, how do you create the kind of incentives that will lead to a great code base? Okay, what's the answer to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what I do at comma and at Tiny Corp is you have to explain it to me. You have to explain to me what this code does. And if I can sit there and come up with a simpler way to do it, you have to rewrite it. You have to agree with me about the simpler way. Obviously, we can have a conversation about this. It's not dictatorial, but if you're like, \"Wow. Wait, that actually is way simpler.\" The simplicity is important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that requires people that overlook the code at the highest levels to be like, okay?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It requires technical leadership you trust.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, technical leadership. So managers or whatever should have to have technical savvy, deep technical savvy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Managers should be better programmers than the people who they manage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And that's not always trivial to create, especially large companies, managers get soft.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And this is just, I've instilled this culture at comma and comma has better programmers than me who work there. But again, I'm like the old guy from Good Will Hunting. It's like, \"Look man, I might not be as good as you, but I can see the difference between me and you.\" And this is what you need, this you need at the top. Or you don't necessarily need the manager to be the absolute best. I shouldn't say that, but they need to be able to recognize skill.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And have good intuition, intuition that's laden with wisdom from all the battles of trying to reduce complexity in code bases.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I took a political approach at comma too, that I think is pretty interesting. I think Elon takes the same political approach. Google had no politics and what ended up happening is the absolute worst kind of politics took over. Comma has an extreme amount of politics and they're all mine and no dissidents is tolerated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so it's a dictatorship.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. It's an absolute dictatorship. Right. Elon does the same thing. Now, the thing about my dictatorship is here are my values.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's just transparent.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's transparent. It's a transparent dictatorship and you can choose to opt in or you get free exit. That's the beauty of companies. If you don't like the dictatorship, you quit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned rewrite before or refactor before features.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you were to refactor the Twitter code base, what would that look like? And maybe also comment on how difficult is it to refactor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The main thing I would do is first of all, identify the pieces and then put tests in between the pieces. So there's all these different Twitter as a microservice architecture, all these different microservices. And the thing that I was working on there... Look, like, \"George didn't know any JavaScript. He asked how to fix search,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Look man, the thing is, I'm upset that the way that this whole thing was portrayed because it wasn't taken by people, honestly. It was taken by people who started out with a bad faith assumption.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you as a program were just being transparent out there, actually having fun, and this is what programming should be about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But I love that Elon gave me this opportunity. Really, it does. And the day I quit, he came on my Twitter spaces afterward and we had a conversation. I respect that so much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And it's also inspiring to just engineers and programmers and it's cool. It should be fun. The people that are hating on it's like, oh man.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was fun. It was fun. It was stressful, but I felt like I was at a cool point in history. And I hope I was useful and I probably kind of wasn't, but maybe [inaudible 02:12:47].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you also were one of the people that kind of made a strong case to refactor and that's a really interesting thing to raise. The timing of that is really interesting. If you look at just the development of autopilot, going from Mobileye... If you look at the history of semi autonomous driving in Tesla, is more and more you could say refactoring or starting from scratch, redeveloping from scratch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's refactoring all the way down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the question is, can you do that sooner? Can you maintain product profitability and what's the right time to do it? How do you do it? And one day, it's like you don't want to pull off the band aids. It's like everything works. It's just little fixed gear and there, but maybe starting from scratch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is the main philosophy of tinygrad. You have never refactored enough. Your code can get smaller, your code can get simpler, your ideas can be more elegant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But say you are running Twitter development teams, engineering teams, would you go as far as different programming language, just go that far?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, the first thing that I would do is build tests. The first thing I would do is get a CI to where people can trust to make changes. Before I touched any code, I would actually say, \"No one touches any code. The first thing we do is we test this code base.\" This is classic. This is how you approach a legacy code base. This is like how to approach a legacy code base book will tell you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you hope that there's modules that can live on for a while and then you add new ones maybe in a different language or design it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Before we add new ones, we replace the old ones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Meaning like, replace old ones with something simpler.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>go actually replaces this thing because all the tests still pass. So step one is testing. And then step two is the programming languages in the afterthought, right? You let a whole lot of people compete and be like, \"Okay, who wants to rewrite a module, whatever language you want to write it in?\" Just the tests have to pass. And if you figure out how to make the test pass, but break the site, we got to go back to step one. Step one is get tests that you trust in order to make changes in the code base.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder how hard it is too, because I'm with you on testing, on everything, from tests to asserts to everything. But code is just covered in this because it should be very easy to make rapid changes and know that it's not going to break everything. And that's the way to do it. But I wonder how difficult is it to integrate tests into a code base that doesn't have many of them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>RPC backend. But this doesn't even really matter. The Thrift and Finagle layer was a great place I thought to write tests, to start building something that looks like process replay. So Twitter had some stuff that looked kind of like this, but it wasn't offline. It was only online. So you could ship a modified version of it, and then you could redirect some of the traffic to your modified version and dif those too, but it was all online. There was no CI in the traditional sense. I mean there was some, but it was not full coverage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can't run all of Twitter offline to test something.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, then this was another problem. You can't run all of Twitter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Period. Any one person can't.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Twitter runs in three data centers and that's it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no other place you can run Twitter, which is like, \"George, you don't understand this is modern software development.\" No, this is bullshit. Why can't it run on my laptop? \"What do you do? Twitter can run it.\" Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm not saying you're going to download the whole database to your laptop, but I'm saying all the middleware and the front end should run on my laptop, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That sounds really compelling. But can that be achieved by a code base that grows over the years? I mean, the three data centers didn't have to be right? Because there's totally different designs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The problem is more like why did the code base have to grow? What new functionality has been added to compensate for the lines of code that are there?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the ways to explain is that the incentive for software developers to move up in the companies to add code, to add especially large-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And you know what? The incentive for politicians to move up in the political structure is to add laws, same problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. If the flip side is to simplify, simplify, simplify.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know what? This is something that I do differently from Elon with comma about self-driving cars. I hear the new version's going to come out and the new version is not going to be better, but at first and it's going to require a ton of refactors. And I say, \"Okay, take as long as you need.\" If you convince me this architecture's better, okay, we have to move to it. Even if it's not going to make the product better tomorrow, the top priority is getting the architecture right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what do you think about a thing where the product is online? So I guess, if you ran engineering on Twitter, would you just do a refactor? How long would it take? What would that mean for the running of the actual service?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think I'd be that good at it. I don't think I'd be good at it. I don't think I'd really be good at running an engineering organization at scale. I think, I could lead a very good refactor of Twitter and it would take six months to a year. And the results to show at the end of it would be feature development. In general, it takes 10 x less time, 10 x less man-hours. That's what I think I could actually do. Do I think that it's the right decision for the business above my pay grade?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But a lot of these kinds of decisions are above everybody's pay grade.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't want to be a manager. I don't want to do that. If you really forced me to, yeah, it would maybe make me upset if I had to make those decisions. I don't want to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But a refactor is so compelling. If this is to become something much bigger than what Twitter was, it feels like a refactor has to be coming at some point.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"George, you're a junior software engineer. Every junior software engineer wants to come in and refactor all code.\" Okay.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, whether they're right or not, it's definitely not for that reason. It's definitely not a question of engineering prowess. It is a question of maybe what the priorities are for the company. And I did get more intelligent feedback from people I think in good faith saying that, like actually from Elon. And from Elon sort of people were like, well, I stop the world refactor might be great for engineering, but we have a business to run. And hey, above my pay grade.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What'd you think about Elon as an engineering leader having to experience him in the most chaotic of spaces, I would say?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>About a whole matrix coming at him. I think that's Andrew Tate's word for it. Sorry to borrow it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also, bigger than engineering, just everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Like the war on the woke.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I wouldn't define the ideal so simply.

I'm probably the same as you, but I like that it generates code and you basically disagree with it and write something simpler. But to me, that somehow is inspiring or makes me feel good.

My experience with Fiverr is closer to your experience with programming. With GPT, it's like you're just frustrated and feel worse about the whole process of design and art and whatever I use five for. I'm using GPT as much as possible to just learn the dynamics of it, these early versions. Because it feels like in the future you'll be using it more and more. For the same reason, I gave away all my books and switched to Kindle, because all right, how long are we going to have paper books? Like 30 years from now? I want to learn to be reading on Kindle even though I don't enjoy it as much and you learn to enjoy it more. In the same way I switched from... Let me just pause. I switched from Emacs to VS Code.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I switched from Vim to VS Code. I think similar, but...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's tough. And that Vim to VS Code is even tougher because Emacs is old, more outdated, feels like it. The community is more outdated. Vim is like pretty vibrant still.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I never used any of the plugins. I still don't use any of it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why I looked at myself in the mirror. I'm like, \"Yeah, you wrote some stuff in Lisp. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't have to set it up. I can just go into any code base and autocomplete's right 90% of the time. Okay, cool. I'll take it. Right? So, I don't think I'm going to have a problem at all adapting to the tools once they're good. But the real thing that I want is not something that like tab completes my code and gives me ideas. The real thing that I want is a very intelligent pair programmer that comes up with a little popup saying, \"Hey, you wrote a bug on line 14 and here's what it is.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

I didn't really think about that typing interaction correctly. Thank you, MyPie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you type hinting, you like pushing the language towards being a typed language.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, absolutely. I think optional typing is great. I mean, look, I think that it's a meet in the middle, right?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, C++ would have you brutally type out SGD string iterator, right? Now, I can just type auto, which is nice.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, no. Like MyPie was a static type checker, but I'm asking just for a runtime type checker.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Enforce the types are on time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I feel like that makes you a better programmer. That's the kind of test that the type remains the same.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that I know, that I didn't mess any types up. But again, MyPie's getting really good and I love it, and I can't wait for some of these tools to become AI powered. I want AI reading my code and giving me feedback. I don't want AI's writing half-assed autocomplete stuff for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder if you can now take GPT and give it a code that you wrote for function and say, how can I make this simpler and have it accomplish the same thing? I think you'll get some good ideas on some code. Maybe not the code you write for tinygrad type of code because that requires so much design thinking, but other kinds of code.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know. I downloaded the plugin maybe two months ago. I tried it again and found the same.

But from what I've seen today, it's like someone occasionally taking over my keyboard that I hired from Fiverr. Yeah, I'd rather not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But ideas about how to debug the code or basically a better debugger is it? It is really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}

And then in 10 years...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think you'll ever get to a hundred percent?

Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know if it's ironic or non, or sarcastic or non.

How many AIs can I employ at my company? As soon as we get the first tiny box up, I'm going to stand up a 65B LLaMA in the Discord. And it's like, yeah, here's the tiny box. He's just like, he's chilling with us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Basically, like you said with niches, most human jobs will eventually be replaced with prompt engineering.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, prompt engineering kind of is this, as you move up the stack, there used to be humans actually doing arithmetic by hand.

And then you have macros, and then you have things that basically just are spreadsheets under the hood like accounting software. As we move further up the abstraction, well, what's at the top of the abstraction stack? Well, prompt engineer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But you see the problem with the AI writing prompts, a definition that I always liked of AI was AI is the do what I mean machine. The computer is so pedantic. It does what you say, but you want the do what I mean, machine, right? You want the machine where you say, \"Get my grandmother out of the burning house.\" It reasonably takes your grandmother and puts her on the ground, not lifts her a thousand feet above the burning house and lets her fall. There's no Zukowski examples.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's not going to find the meaning. I mean, to do what I mean, it has to figure stuff out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the thing you'll maybe ask it to do is run government for me.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>do what I mean very much comes down to how aligned is that AI with you. Of course, when you talk to an AI that's made by a big company in the cloud, the AI fundamentally is aligned to them, not to you. And that's why you have to buy a tiny box. So you make sure the AI stays aligned to you. Every time that they start to pass AI regulation or GPU regulation, I'm going to see sales of tiny boxes spike. It's going to be like guns. Every time they talk about gun regulation, boom. Gun sales.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in the space of AI, you're an anarchist, anarchism espouser, believer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm an informational anarchist. Yes. I'm an informational anarchist and a physical status. I do not think anarchy in the physical world is very good because I exist in the physical world. But I think we can construct this virtual world where anarchy, it can't hurt you. I love that Tyler, the creator tweet. It was, \"Cyber bullying isn't real, man. Have you tried? Turn it off the screen, close your eyes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But how do you prevent the AI from basically replacing all human prompt engineers where nobody's the prompt engineer anymore? So autonomy, greater and greater autonomy until it's full autonomy. And that's just where it's headed. Because one person's going to say, \"Run everything for me.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If the AIs go on to actually turn the world into paperclips and then they die out themselves, well that's horrific. And we don't want that to happen. So this is what I mean about robustness. I trust robust machines. The current AIs are so not robust. This comes back to the idea that we've never made a machine that can self replicate.

I'm sure there's some part of it in Skyrim, but it's not like if you ask the creators... The Big Bang is in universe, right? I'm sure they have some Big Bang notion in Skyrim, right? But that obviously is not at all how Skyrim was actually created. It was created by a bunch of programmers in a room. So it struck me one day how just silly atheism is. Of course, we were created by God. It's the most obvious thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's such a nice way to put it. We're such powerful creators ourselves. It's silly not to conceive that there's creators even more powerful than us.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And then I also like that notion. That notion gives me a lot of...

If we mess it all up and we die out, yeah.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The same way that a video game has comfort in it.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, this is what... I don't know. There's probably some ego trip of mine. \"You want to stand eye to eye with God. You're just blasphemous, man.\" Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if it would upset God. I think he wants that. I mean, I certainly want that from my creations. I want my creations to stand eye to eye with me. So why wouldn't God want me to stand eye to eye with him? That's the best I can do, golden rule.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm just imagining the creator of a video game, having to look, stand eye to eye, with one of the characters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I only watched season one of Westworld.

It feels like a really special time in human history, where that's actually possible. There's something about AI that's... we're playing with something weird here. Something really weird.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I wrote a blog post, \"I reread Genesis and just looked like... they give you some clues at the end of Genesis for finding the Garden of Eden.

Thank you for doing everything you're doing and in this case, for fighting for open source or for decentralization of AI. It's a fight worth fighting, fight worth winning, hashtag. I love you, brother. These conversations are always great. Hope to talk to you many more times. Good luck with Tiny Corp.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you. Great to be here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with George Hotz. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein, \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
