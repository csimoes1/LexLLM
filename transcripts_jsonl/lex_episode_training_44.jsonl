{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I see the danger of this concentration of power through proprietary AI systems as a much bigger danger than everything else. What works against this is people who think that for reasons of security, we should keep AI systems under lock and key because it's too dangerous to put it in the hands of everybody. That would lead to a very bad future in which all of our information diet is controlled by a small number of companies who proprietary systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I believe that people are fundamentally good, and so if AI, especially open source AI can make them smarter, it just empowers the goodness in humans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I share that feeling. Okay. I think people are fundamentally good and in fact, a lot of doomers are doomers because they don't think that people are fundamentally good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Yann LeCun, his third time on this podcast. He is the chief AI scientist at Meta, professor at NYU, Turing Award winner and one of the seminal figures in the history of artificial intelligence. He and Meta AI have been big proponents of open sourcing, AI development and have been walking the walk by open sourcing many of their biggest models, including Llama 2 and eventually Llama 3. Also, Yann has been an outspoken critic of those people in the AI community who warn about the looming danger and existential threat of AGI. He believes the AGI will be created one day, but it will be good. It will not escape human control, nor will it dominate and kill all humans. At this moment of rapid AI development, this happens to be somewhat a controversial position, and so it's been fun seeing Yann get into a lot of intense and fascinating discussions online as we do in this very conversation. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Yann LeCun. You've had some strong statements, technical statements about the future of artificial intelligence throughout your career actually, but recently as well, you've said that autoregressive LLMs are not the way we're going to make progress towards superhuman intelligence. These are the large language models like GPT-4, like Llama 2 and 3 soon and so on. How do they work and why are they not going to take us all the way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>20 megabytes per second roughly, and so 10 to the 15 bytes for a four-year-old versus two times 10 to the 13 bytes for 170,000 years worth of reading. What that tells you is that through sensory input, we see a lot more information than we do through language, and that despite our intuition, most of what we learn and most of our knowledge is through our observation and interaction with the real world, not through language. Everything that we learn in the first few years of life, and certainly everything that animals learn has nothing to do with language.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it would be good to maybe push against some of the intuition behind what you're saying. So it is true there's several orders of magnitude more data coming into the human mind much faster, and the human mind is able to learn very quickly from that, filter the data very quickly. Somebody might argue your comparison between sensory data versus language, that language is already very compressed. It already contains a lot more information than the bytes it takes to store them if you compare it to visual data. So there's a lot of wisdom and language. There's words, and the way we stitch them together, it already contains a lot of information. So is it possible that language alone already has enough wisdom and knowledge in there to be able to, from that language, construct a world model and understanding of the world, an understanding of the physical world that you're saying LLMs lack?<|eot_id|>"}

Why is that? What are we missing? What type of learning or reasoning architecture or whatever are we missing that basically prevent us from having level five sort of in cars and domestic robots?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can a large language model construct a world model that does know how to drive and does know how to fill a dishwasher, but just doesn't know how to deal with visual data at this time, so it can operate in a space of concepts?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>input. And then you just feed that to the LLM in addition to the text, and you just expect the LLM, during training, to be able to use those representations to help make decisions. I mean, there's been work along those lines for quite a long time and now, you see those systems. I mean there are LLMs that have some vision extension, but they're basically hacks in the sense that those things are not trained to really understand the world. They're not trained with video, for example. They don't really understand intuitive physics, at least not at the moment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you don't think there's something special to you about intuitive physics, about sort of common sense reasoning about the physical space, about physical reality. That to you is a giant leap that LLMs are just not able to do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we just call them LLMs, and there is a difference between this kind of process and a process by which before producing a word... When you and I talk, you and I are bilingual, we think about what we're going to say, and it's relatively independent of the language in which we're going to say. When we talk about, I don't know, let's say a mathematical concept or something, the kind of thinking that we're doing and the answer that we're planning to produce is not linked to whether we're going to see it in French or Russian or English.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Chomsky just rolled his eyes, but I understand, so you're saying that there's a bigger abstraction that goes before language and maps onto language?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. It's certainly true for a lot of thinking that we do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that obvious that we don't... You're saying your thinking is same in French as it is in English?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, pretty much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pretty much or how flexible are you if there's a probability distribution?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it depends what kind of thinking, right? If it's producing puns, I get much better in French than English about that, or much worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there an abstract representation of puns? Is your humor an abstract... When you tweet and your tweets are sometimes a little bit spicy, is there an abstract representation in your brain of a tweet before it maps onto English?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>subconscious actions where you're distracted, you're doing something, you're completely concentrated, and someone comes to you and asks you a question and you kind of answer the question. You don't have time to think about the answer, but the answer is easy. So you don't need to pay attention. You sort of respond automatically. That's kind of what an LLM does. It doesn't think about its answer really. It retrieves it because it's accumulated a lot of knowledge. So it can retrieve some things, but it's going to just spit out one token after the other without planning the answer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you're making it sound just one token after the other. One token at a time generation is bound to be simplistic, but if the world model is sufficiently sophisticated that one token at a time, the most likely thing it generates is a sequence of tokens is going to be a deeply profound thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But then that assumes that those systems actually possess an eternal world model.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So really goes to the... I think the fundamental question is can you build a really complete world model, not complete, but one that has a deep understanding of the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at time, T+1? Now that state of the world does not need to represent everything about the world, it just needs to represent enough that's relevant for this planning of the action, but not necessarily all the details. Now, here is the problem. You're not going to be able to do this with generative models. So a generative model has trained on video, and we've tried to do this for 10 years, you take a video, show a system, a piece of video, and then ask you to predict the reminder of the video, basically predict what's going to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One frame at a time, do the same thing as the autoregressive LLMs do, but for video.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Either one frame at a time-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>LVMs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>has basically failed. All the systems that attempt to predict missing parts of an image or video from a corrupted version of it, basically, so take an image or a video, corrupt it or transform it in some way, and then try to reconstruct the complete video or image from the corrupted version, and then hope that internally, the system will develop good representations of images that you can use for object recognition, segmentation, whatever it is. That has been essentially a complete failure and it works really well for text. That's the principle that is used for LLMs, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So where's the failure exactly? Is it that it's very difficult to form a good representation of an image, like a good embedding of all the important information in the image? Is it in terms of the consistency of image to image, to image to image that forms the video? If we do a highlight reel of all the ways you failed, what's that look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of my colleagues at FAIR, masked autoencoder. So it's basically like the LLMs or things like this where you train the system by corrupting texts except you corrupt images, you remove patches from it, and you train a gigantic neural network reconstruct. The features you get are not good, and you know they're not good because if you now train the same architecture, but you train it to supervise with label data, with textual descriptions of images, et cetera, you do get good representations and the performance on recognition tasks is much better than if you do this self-supervised retraining.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The architecture is good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The architecture is good, the architecture of the encoder is good, but the fact that you train the system to reconstruct images does not lead it to produce to long, good generic features of images.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you train in a self-supervised way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Self-supervised by reconstruction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, by reconstruction.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, so what's the alternative? The alternative is joint embedding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is joint embedding? What are these architectures that you're so excited about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>revive this type of method, some of them from FAIR, some of them from Google and other places, but there are limitations to those contrastive methods. What has changed in the last three, four years is now we have methods that are non-contrastive. So they don't require those negative contrastive samples of images that we know are different. You turn them on you with images that are different versions or different views of the same thing, and you rely on some other tricks to prevent the system from collapsing. And we have half a dozen different methods for this now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the fundamental difference between joint embedding architectures and LLMs? Can JEPA take us to AGI? Whether we should say that you don't like the term AGI, and we'll probably argue I think every single time I've talked to you, we've argued about the G in AGI.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I get it. I get it. Well, we'll probably continue to argue about it. It's great. You like AMI because you like French and ami is friend in French, and AMI stands for advanced machine intelligence. But either way, can JEPA take us to that towards that advanced machine intelligence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that. So we can't just only model everything at the lowest level. And that's what the idea of JEPA is really about, learn abstract representation in a self-supervised manner, and you can do it hierarchically as well. So that, I think, is an essential component of an intelligent system. And in language, we can get away without doing this because language is already to some level abstract and already has eliminated a lot of information that is not predictable. And so we can get away without doing the joint embedding, without lifting the abstraction level and by directly predicting words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So joint embedding, it's still generative, but it's generative in this abstract representation space?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're saying language, we were lazy with language because we already got the abstract representation for free, and now we have to zoom out, actually think about generally intelligent systems. We have to deal with a full mess of physical reality, of reality. And you do have to do this step of jumping from the full, rich, detailed reality to a abstract representation of that reality based on what you can then reason and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if the input data you feed them is more redundant. The more redundancy there is in the data, the more they're able to capture some internal structure of it. And so there is way more redundancy in the structure in perceptual inputs, sensory input like vision than there is in text, which is not nearly as redundant. This is back to the question you were asking a few minutes ago. Language might represent more information really, because it's already compressed. You're right about that, but that means it's also less redundant, and so self-supervision, you will not work as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible to join the self-supervised training on visual data and self-supervised training on language data? There is a huge amount of knowledge, even though you talk down about those 10 to the 13 tokens. Those 10 to the 13 tokens represent the entirety- Those 10 to the 13 tokens represent the entirety, a large fraction of what us humans have figured out, both the shit-talk on Reddit and the contents of all the books and the articles and the full spectrum of human intellectual creation. So is it possible to join those two together?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to the level of even the intelligence or level of understanding of the world of a cat or a dog, which doesn't have language. They don't have language and they understand the world much better than any LLM. They can plan really complex actions and imagine the result of a bunch of actions. How do we get machines to learn that before we combine that with language? Obviously if we combine this with language, this is going to be a winner, but before that, we have to focus on how do we get systems to learn how the world works?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this joint-embedding predictive architecture, for you, that's going to be able to learn something like common sense, something like what a cat uses to predict how to mess with its owner most optimally by knocking over a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>input from the corrupted input. But you only train the second branch. You only train the part of the network that is fed with the corrupted input. The other network, you don't train. But since they share the same weight, when you modify the first one, it also modifies the second one. And with various tricks, you can prevent the system from collapsing with the collapse of the type I was explaining before, where the system basically ignores the input. So that works very well. The two techniques we developed at FAIR, DINO and I-JEPA work really well for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what kind of data are we talking about here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So there's several scenario, one scenario is you take an image, you corrupt it by changing the cropping, for example, changing the size a little bit, maybe changing the orientation, blurring it, changing the colors, doing all kinds of horrible things to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But basic horrible things?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how to do this masking. Whereas with DINO, you need to know it's an image because you need to do things like geometry transformation and blurring and things like that, that are really image specific. A more recent version of this that we have is called V-JEPA. So it's basically the same idea as I-JEPA except it's applied to video. So now you take a whole video and you mask a whole chunk of it. And what we mask is actually kind of a temporal tube, so a whole segment of each frame in the video over the entire video.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that tube was statically positioned throughout the frames, just literally it's a straight tube.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>frames or something, and we mask the same region over the entire 16 frames. It's a different one for every video obviously. And then again, train that system so as to predict the representation of the full video from the partially masked video. And that works really well. It's the first system that we have that learns good representations of video so that when you feed those representations to a supervised classifier head, it can tell you what action is taking place in the video with pretty good accuracy. So that's the first time we get something of that quality.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good test that a good representation is formed. That means there's something to this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We also preliminary result that seem to indicate that the representation allow our system to tell whether the video is physically possible or completely impossible, because some object disappeared or an object suddenly jumped from one location to another or changed shape or something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's able to capture some physics based constraints about the reality represented in the video, about the appearance and the disappearance of objects.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's really new.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, but can this actually get us to this kind of world model that understands enough about the world to be able to drive a car?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not talking about learning, we're talking about inference time, so this is planning, really. And in optimal control, this is a very classical thing. It's called model predictive control. You have a model of the system you want to control that can predict the sequence of states corresponding to a sequence of commands. And you're planning a sequence of commands so that according to your role model, the end state of the system will satisfy an objectives that you fix. This is the way rocket trajectories have been planned since computers have been around, so since the early '60s essentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So yes, for a model predictive control, but you also often talk about hierarchical planning. Can hierarchical planning emerge from this somehow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of what's going to happen, how long it's going to take to catch a taxi or to go to the airport with traffic. I mean, you would have to know exactly the condition of everything to be able to do this planning and you don't have the information. So you have to do this hierarchical planning so that you can start acting and then sort of replanning as you go. And nobody really knows how to do this in AI. Nobody knows how to train a system to learn the appropriate multiple levels of representation so that hierarchical planning works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does something like that already emerge? So can you use an LLM, state-of-the-art LLM, to get you from New York to Paris by doing exactly the kind of detailed set of questions that you just did, which is, can you give me a list of 10 steps I need to do, to get from New York to Paris? And then for each of those steps, can you give me a list of 10 steps, how I make that step happen? And for each of those steps, can you give me a list of 10 steps to make each one of those, until you're moving your individual muscles, maybe not, whatever you can actually act upon using your own mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. So there's a lot of questions that are also implied by this, right? So the first thing is LLMs will be able to answer some of those questions down to some level of abstraction, under the condition that they've been trained with similar scenarios in their training set.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They would be able to answer all of those questions, but some of them may be hallucinated meaning non-factual.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>true. I mean they'll probably produce some answer except they're not going to be able to really produce millisecond by millisecond muscle control of how you stand up from your chair. But down to some level of abstraction where you can describe things by words, they might be able to give you a plan, but only under the condition that they've been trained to produce those kinds of plans. They're not going to be able to plan for situations where that they never encountered before. They basically are going to have to regurgitate the template that they've been trained on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just for the example of New York to Paris, is it going to start getting into trouble? Which layer of abstraction do you think you'll start? I can imagine almost every single part of that, an LLM would be able to answer somewhat accurately, especially when you're talking about New York and Paris, major cities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you fine tune it for it. And so I can't say that an LLM cannot do this, it can do this if you train it for it, there's no question down to a certain level where things can be formulated in terms of words. But if you want to go down to how you climb down the stairs or just stand up from your chair in terms of words, you can't do it. That's one of the reasons you need experience of the physical world, which is much higher bandwidth than what you can express in words, in human language.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So everything we've been talking about on the joint embedding space, is it possible that that's what we need for the interaction with physical reality on the robotics front, and then just the LLMs are the thing that sits on top of it for the bigger reasoning, about the fact that I need to book a plane ticket and I need to know how to go to the websites and so on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can't invent how you take a person who's never heard of airplanes and tell them how do you go from New York to Paris? And they're probably not going to be able to deconstruct the whole plan unless they've seen examples of that before. So certainly LLMs are going to be able to do this, but then how you link this from the low level of actions, that needs to be done with things like JEPA that basically lift the abstraction level of the representation without attempting to reconstruct the detail of the situation, that's why we need JEPAs for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I would love to sort of linger on your skepticism around auto regressive LLMs. So one way I would like to test that skepticism is everything you say makes a lot of sense, but if I apply everything you said today and in general to I don't know, 10 years ago, maybe a little bit less, no, let's say three years ago, I wouldn't be able to predict the success of LLMs. So does it make sense to you that autoregressive LLMs are able to be so damn good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain your intuition? Because if I were to take your wisdom and intuition at face value, I would say there's no way autoregressive LLMs, one token at a time, would be able to do the kind of things they're doing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you can build an auto aggressive LLM from. So there was a surprise many years ago with what's called decoder only LLM. So since systems of this type that are just trying to produce words from the previous one and the fact that when you scale them up, they tend to really understand more about language. When you train them on lots of data, you make them really big. That was a surprise and that surprise occurred quite a while back, with work from Google, Meta, OpenAI, et cetera, going back to the GPT kind of work, general pre-trained transformers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mean like GPT2? There's a certain place where you start to realize scaling might actually keep giving us an emergent benefit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean there were work from various places, but if you want to place it in the GPT timeline, that would be around GPT2, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, because you said it so charismatic and you said so many words, but self supervised learning, yes. But again, the same intuition you're applying to saying that auto aggressive LLMs cannot have a deep understanding of the world. If we just apply that, same intuition, does it make sense to you that they're able to form enough of a representation in the world to be damn convincing, essentially passing the original touring test with flying colors?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we're fooled by their fluency, right? We just assume that if a system is fluent in manipulating language, then it has all the characteristics of human intelligence, but that impression is false. We're really fooled by it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think Alan Turing would say, without understanding anything, just hanging out with it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Alan Turing would decide that a Turing test is a really bad test, okay?

We had similar success in speech recognition, a system called WAVE2VEC, which is also a joint embedding architecture, by the way, trained with contrastive running. And that system also can produce speech recognition systems that are multilingual with mostly unlabeled data and only need a few minutes of labeled data to actually do speech recognition, that's amazing. We have systems now based on those combination of ideas that can do real time translation of hundreds of languages into each other, speech to speech.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speech to speech, even including, which is fascinating, languages that don't have written forms.<|eot_id|>"}

And we tried many times, we published lots of papers on it, where they kind of sort of work, but not really great. They started working, we abandoned this idea of predicting every pixel and basically just doing the joint embedding and predicting and representation space, that works. So there's ample evidence that we're not going to be able to learn good representations of the real world using generative model. So I'm telling people, everybody's talking about generative AI. If you're really interested in human level AI, abandon the idea of generative AI.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, but you really think it's possible to get far with the joint embedding representation. So there's common sense reasoning, and then there's high level reasoning. I feel like those are two... The kind of reasoning that LLMs are able to do, okay, let me not use the word reasoning, but the kind of stuff that LLMs are able to do, seems fundamentally different than the common sense reasoning we use to navigate the world. It seems like we're going to need both. Would you be able to get, with the joint embedding, which is JEPA type of approach, looking at video, would you be able to learn, let's see, well, how to get from New York to Paris or how to understand the state of politics in the world today. These are things where various humans generate a lot of language and opinions on, in the space of language, but don't visually represent that in any clearly compressible way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Well, there's a lot of situations that might be difficult to, for a purely language based system to know. Okay, you can probably learn from reading texts, the entirety of the publicly available texts in the world that I cannot get from New York to Paris by snapping my fingers. That's not going to work, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But there's probably more complex scenarios of this type, which an LLM may never have encountered and may not be able to determine whether it's possible or not. So that link from the low level to the high level, the thing is that the high level that language expresses is based on the common experience of the low level, which LLMs currently do not have. When we talk to each other, we know we have a common experience of the world. A lot of it is similar, and LLMs don't have that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But see, it's present. You and I have a common experience of the world in terms of the physics of how gravity works and stuff like this, and that common knowledge of the world, I feel like is there, in the language. We don't explicitly express it, but if you have a huge amount of text, you're going to get this stuff that's between the lines. In order to form a consistent world model, you're going to have to understand how gravity works, even if you don't have an explicit explanation of gravity. So even though in the case of gravity, there is explicit explanations of gravity in Wikipedia. But the stuff that we think of as common sense reasoning, I feel like to generate language correctly, you're going to have to figure that out. Now, you could say as you have, there's not enough text... Sorry, okay, so you don't think so?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I agree with what you just said, which is that to be able to do high level common sense, to have high level common sense, you need to have the low level common sense to build on top of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that's not there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that's not there in the LLMs. LLMs are purely trained from text.

If I accidentally knock this over, you'll probably make fun of me in the content of the you making fun of me will be explanation of the fact that cups fall, and then gravity works in this way. And then you'll have some very vague information about what kind of things explode when they hit the ground. And then maybe you'll make a joke about entropy or something like this, then we'll never be able to reconstruct this again. You'll make a little joke like this and there'll be a trillion of other jokes. And from the jokes, you can piece together the fact that gravity works and mugs can break and all this kind of stuff. You don't need to see, it'll be very inefficient. It's easier to knock the thing over, but I feel like it would be there if you have enough of that data.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I just think that most of the information of this type that we have accumulated when we were babies, it's just not present in text, in any description, essentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the sensory data is a much richer source for getting that kind of understanding.<|eot_id|>"}

You know by 18 months, you know about why people want to do things and you help them if they can't. I mean, there's a lot of things that you learn mostly by observation, really not even through interaction. In the first few months of life, babies don't really have any influence on the world, they can only observe. And you accumulate a gigantic amount of knowledge just from that. So that's what we're missing from current AI systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think in one of your slides, you have this nice plot that is one of the ways you show that LLMs are limited.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, so because of the autoregressive prediction, every time an produces a token or a word, there is some level of probability for that word to take you out of the set of reasonable answers. And if you assume, which is a very strong assumption, that the probability of such error is that those errors are independent across a sequence of tokens being produced. What that means is that every time you produce a token, the probability that you stay within the set of correct answer decreases and it decreases exponentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a strong, like you said, assumption there that if there's a non-zero probability of making a mistake, which there appears to be, then there's going to be a kind of drift.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and that drift is exponential. It's like errors accumulate. So the probability that an answer would be nonsensical increases exponentially with the number of tokens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that obvious to you, by the way? Well, mathematically speaking maybe, but isn't there a kind of gravitational pull towards the truth? Because on average, hopefully, the truth is well represented in the training set?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is absolutely tiny, it's a tiny, tiny, tiny subset of all possible prompts. And so the system will behave properly on the prompts that has been either trained, pre-trained, or fine-tuned, but then there is an entire space of things that it cannot possibly have been trained on because the number is gigantic. So whatever training the system has been subject to produce appropriate answers, you can break it by finding out a prompt that will be outside of the set of prompts that's been trained on, or things that are similar, and then it will just spew complete nonsense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you say prompt, do you mean that exact prompt or do you mean a prompt that's in many parts, very different than?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People have come up with things where you put essentially a random sequence of characters in the prompt and that's enough to throw the system into a mode where it is going to answer something completely different than it would have answered without this. So that's a way to jailbreak the system, basically go outside of its conditioning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a very clear demonstration of it, but of course, that goes outside of what is designed to do, right? If you actually stitch together reasonably grammatical sentences, is it that easy to break it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, some people have done things like, you write a sentence in English or you ask a question in English and it produces a perfectly fine answer and then you just substitute a few words by the same word in another language and all of a sudden the answer is complete nonsense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What I'm saying is, which fraction of prompts that humans are likely to generate are going to break the system?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>multiply by number of tokens, that's it. And so essentially, it doesn't matter if the question being asked is simple to answer, complicated to answer, impossible to answer because it's a decidable or something, the amount of computation the system will be able to devote to the answer is constant or is proportional to number of token produced in the answer. This is not the way we work, the way we reason is that when we're faced with a complex problem or a complex question, we spend more time trying to solve it and answer it because it's more difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a prediction element, there's an iterative element where you're adjusting your understanding of a thing by going over and over and over, there's a hierarchical elements on.

No, that it's just the low level world model on top of which we can then build some of these kinds of mechanisms, like you said, persistent long-term memory or reasoning, so on.

Now we ignore the issue for a moment of how you train that system to measure whether an answer is a good answer for a fraction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's an optimization process. You can do this if the entire system is differentiable, that scaler output is the result of running the representation of the answers to some neural net. Then by gradient descent, by back propagating gradients, you can figure out how to modify the representation of the answers so as to minimize that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's still a gradient based?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's gradient based inference. So now you have a representation of the answer in abstract space, now you can turn it into text.

So you're operating in the subtract representation. This goes back to the joint embedding, that it's better to work in the space of, I don't know, or to romanticize the notion like space of concepts versus the space of concrete sensory information.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But can this do something like reasoning, which is what we're talking about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in a horribly inefficient way, which is generate a lot of hypothesis and then select the best ones.

So it's much better to do an optimization in continuous space where you can do gradient and descent as opposed to generate tons of things and then select the best, you just iteratively refine your answer to go towards the best, that's much more efficient. But you can only do this in continuous spaces with differentiable functions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're talking about the ability to think deeply or to reason deeply, how do you know what is an answer that's better or worse based on deep reasoning?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this is by having a regularizer, a criterion, a term in your cost function that basically minimizes the volume of space that can take low energy.

That's a model. Otherwise, if it's a system that is on the more classical services, it can be ad supported or there's several models. But the point is, if you have a big enough potential customer base and you need to build that system anyway for them, it doesn't hurt you to actually distribute it to the open source.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, I'm no business guy, but if you release the open source model, then other people can do the same kind of task and compete on it, basically provide fine-tuned models for businesses.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, no. The bet is more, \"We already have a huge user base and customer base-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ah, right.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be useful for our customers, we can just buy it from them. It could be that they will improve the platform. In fact, we see this already. There is literally millions of downloads of LLaMA 2 and thousands of people who have provided ideas about how to make it better. So this clearly accelerates progress to make the system available to a wide community of people, and there's literally thousands of businesses who are building applications with it. So Meta's ability to derive revenue from this technology is not impaired by the distribution of base models in open source.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The fundamental criticism that Gemini is getting is that as you point out on the West Coast, just to clarify, we're currently on the East Coast where I would suppose Meta AI headquarters would be. So there are strong words about the West Coast, but I guess the issue that happens is I think it's fair to say that most tech people have a political affiliation with the left wing. They lean left. So the problem that people are criticizing Gemini with is that there's in that de-biasing process that you mentioned, that their ideological lean becomes obvious. Is this something that could be escaped? You're saying open source is the only way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you witnessed this kind of ideological lean that makes engineering difficult?<|eot_id|>"}

It's going to be you push it in one way, one set of people are going to see it as biased, and then you push it the other way and another set of people is going to see it as biased. Then in addition to this, there's the issue of if you push the system perhaps a little too far in one direction, it's going to be non-factual. You're going to have Black Nazi soldiers in uniform.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we so we should mention image generation of Black Nazi soldiers, which is not factually accurate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, and can be offensive for some people as well. So it's going to be impossible to produce systems that are unbiased for everyone. So the only solution that I see is diversity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Diversity in the full meaning of that word, diversity of in every possible way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Marc Andreessen just tweeted today. Let me do a TL;DR. The conclusion is only startups and open source can avoid the issue that he's highlighting with big tech. He's asking, \"Can Big Tech actually field generative AI products?\" (1) Ever-escalating demands from internal activists, employee mobs, crazed executives, broken boards, pressure groups, extremist regulators, government agencies, the press, in quotes, \"experts\" and everything corrupting the output. (2) Constant risk of generating a bad answer or drawing a bad picture or rendering a bad video who knows what is going to say or do at any moment. (3) Legal exposure, product liability, slander, election law, many other things and so on, anything that makes Congress mad. (4) Continuous attempts to tighten grip on acceptable output, degrade the model, how good it actually is, in terms of usable and pleasant to use and effective and all that kind of stuff. (5) Publicity of bad text, images, video actual puts those examples into the training data for the next version and so on. So he just highlights how difficult this is from all kinds of people being unhappy. He said you can't create a system that makes everybody happy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you're going to do the fine-tuning yourself and keep it close source, essentially, the problem there is then trying to minimize the number of people who are going to be unhappy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying that almost impossible to do, and there are better ways to do open source<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to preserve their business. So it's essentially impossible for systems like this that can inevitably formulate political opinions, and opinions about various things that may be political or not, but that people may disagree about, about moral issues and questions about religion and things like that or cultural issues that people from different communities would disagree with in the first place. So there's only a relatively small number of things that people will agree on are basic principles, but beyond that, if you want those systems to be useful, they will necessarily have to offend a number of people inevitably.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So open source is just better and then you get-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Diversity is better, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And open source enables diversity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right. Open source enables diversity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This can be a fascinating world where if it's true that the open source world, if Meta leads the way and creates this open source foundation model world, governments will have a fine- tuned model and then potentially, people that vote left and right will have their own model and preference to be able to choose and it will potentially divide us even more. But that's on us humans. We get to figure out basically the technology enables humans to human more effectively, and all the difficult ethical questions that humans raise will just leave it up to us to figure that out.<|eot_id|>"}

Then the fine-tuning that people will add or the additional guardrails that people will add will cater to their community, whatever it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The fine-tuning will be more about the gray areas of what is hate speech, what is dangerous and all that kind of stuff, but it's the-<|eot_id|>"}

I can give you a very precise list of instructions of how you build a rocket engine. Even if you have a team of 50 engineers that are really experienced building it, you're still going to have to blow up a dozen of them before you get one that works. It's the same with chemical weapons or bioweapons or things like this, it requires expertise in the real world that the LLM is not going to help you with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It requires even the common sense expertise that we've been talking about, which is how to take language-based instructions and materialize them in the physical world requires a lot of knowledge that's not in the instructions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Fairway was started. Before that, 30 years ago, we were working, oh, sorry, 35 on combination nets and the early days of neural nets. So I'm super excited because I see a path towards potentially human-level intelligence with systems that can understand the world, remember, plan, reason. There is some set of ideas to make progress there that might have a chance of working, and I'm really excited about this. What I like is that somewhat we get on to a good direction and perhaps succeed before my brain turns to a white sauce or before I need to retire.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Is it beautiful to you just the amount of GPUs involved, the whole training process on this much compute, just zooming out, just looking at earth and humans together have built these computing devices and are able to train this one brain, then we then open source, like giving birth to this open source brain trained on this gigantic compute system, there's just the details of how to train on that, how to build the infrastructure and the hardware, the cooling, all of this kind of stuff, or are you just still that most of your excitement is in the theory aspect of it, meaning the software?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>really far, so there's a lot of progress to make in hardware. Right now, a lot of the progress is, there's a bit coming from silicon technology, but a lot of it coming from architectural innovation and quite a bit coming from more efficient ways of implementing the architectures that have become popular, basically combination of transformers and com nets, and so there's still some ways to go until we are going to saturate. We're going to have to come up with new principles, new fabrication technology, new basic components perhaps based on different principles and classical digital [inaudible 02:03:41]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, if we want to make it ubiquitous, yeah, certainly, 'cause we're going to have to reduce the power consumption. A GPU today is half a kilowatt to a kilowatt. Human brain is about 25 watts, and a GPU is way below the power of the human brain. You need something like 100,000 or a million to match it, so we are off by a huge factor here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You often say that a GI is not coming soon, meaning not this year, not the next few years, potentially farther away. What's your basic intuition behind that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of different situation at hand, the way the human brain can, all of this is going to take at least a decade and probably much more because there are a lot of problems that we're not seeing right now that we have not encountered, so we don't know if there is an easy solution within this framework. So it's not just around the corner. I've been hearing people for the last 12, 15 years claiming that AGI is just around the corner and being systematically wrong. I knew they were wrong when they were saying it. I called their bullshit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, from the birth of the term artificial intelligence, there has been a eternal optimism that's perhaps unlike other technologies. Is it a Moravec's paradox, the explanation for why people are so optimistic about AGI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Don't think it's just Moravec's paradox. Moravec's paradox is a consequence of realizing that the world is not as easy as we think. So first of all, intelligence is not a linear thing that you can measure with a scale or with a single number. Can you say that humans are smarter than orangutans? In some ways, yes, but in some ways, orangutans are smarter than humans in a lot of domains that allows them to survive in the forest, for example.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So IQ is a very limited measure of intelligence. Human intelligence is bigger than what IQ, for example, measures.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, IQ can measure approximately something for humans, but because humans come in relatively uniform form, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you were talking about other intelligent entities for which the basic things that are easy to them is very different, then it doesn't mean anything. So intelligence is a collection of skills and an ability to acquire new skills efficiently. The collection of skills that a particular intelligent entity possess or is capable of learning quickly is different from the collection of skills of another one. Because it's a multidimensional thing, the set of skills is a high dimensional space, you can't measure, you cannot compare two things as to whether one is more intelligent than the other. It's multidimensional.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you push back against what are called AI doomers a lot. Can you explain their perspective and why you think they're wrong?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>reason is they're not going to be a species. They're not going to be a species that competes with us. They're not going to have the desire to dominate because the desire to dominate is something that has to be hardwired into an intelligent system. It is hardwired in humans. It is hardwired in baboons, in chimpanzees, in wolves, not in orangutans. The species in which this desire to dominate or submit or attain status in other ways is specific to social species. Non-social species like orangutans don't have it, and they are as smart as we are, almost, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To you, there's not significant incentive for humans to encode that into the AI systems, and to the degree they do, there'll be other AIs that punish them for it, I'll compete them over it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's all kinds of incentive to make AI systems submissive to humans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right? This is the way we're going to build them. So then people say, \"Oh, but look at LLMs. LLMs are not controllable,\" and they're right. LLMs are not controllable. But objectively-driven AI, so systems that derive their answers by optimization of an objective means they have to optimize this objective, and that objective can include guardrails. One guardrail is, obey humans. Another guardrail is, don't obey humans if it's hurting other humans within limits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. I've heard that before somewhere, I don't remember-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, maybe in a book.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but speaking of that book, could there be unintended consequences also from all of this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of how to make turbojets safe? No, it took decades to fine tune the design of those systems so that they were safe. Is there a separate group within General Electric or Snecma or whatever that is specialized in turbojet safety? No. The design is all about safety, because a better turbojet is also a safer turbojet, so a more reliable one. It's the same for AI. Do you need specific provisions to make AI safe? No, you need to make better AI systems, and they will be safe because they are designed to be more useful and more controllable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's imagine a system, AI system that's able to be incredibly convincing and can convince you of anything. I can at least imagine such a system, and I can see such a system be weapon like because it can control people's minds. We're pretty gullible.

That you could imagine Hitler, Stalin, Mao getting the weapon first, and that having a different kind of impact on the world than the United States getting the weapon first.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably first within industry. This is not a domain where government or military organizations are particularly innovative and they're in fact way behind. And so this is going to come from industry and this kind of information disseminates extremely quickly. We've seen this over the last few years where you have a new ... Even take AlphaGo, this was reproduced within three months even without particularly detailed information, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

Those things, you don't need to know exactly the details of how they work to know that it's possible because it's deployed and then it's getting reproduced. And then people who work for those companies move. They go from one company to another and the information disseminates. What makes the success of the US tech industry and Silicon Valley in particular is exactly that, is because the information circulates really, really quickly and disseminates very quickly. And so the whole region is ahead because of that circulation of information.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe just to linger on the psychology of AI doomers, you give, in the classic Yann LeCun way, a pretty good example of just when a new technology comes to be, you say engineer says, \"I invented this new thing. I call it a ball pen.\" And then the Twitter sphere responds, \"OMG people could write horrible things with it, like misinformation, propaganda, hate speech. Ban it now.\" Then writing doomers come in, akin to the AI doomers, \"Imagine if everyone can get a ball pen. This could destroy society. There should be a law against using ball pen to write hate speech, regulate ball pens now.\" And then the pencil industry mogul says, \"Yeah, ball pens are very dangerous. Unlike pencil writing, which is erasable, ball pen writing stays forever. Government should require a license for a pen manufacturer.\" This does seem to be part of human psychology when it comes up against new technology.

Electricity was going to kill everyone at some point. The train was going to be a horrible thing because you can't breathe past 50 kilometers an hour.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

So, I think it's a really, really important question for society. And the problem I'm seeing is that, which is why I've been so vocal and sometimes a little sardonic about it-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Never stop. Never stop, Yann. We love it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>through AI systems, we need those to be diverse for the preservation of diversity of ideas and creed and political opinions and whatever, and the preservation of democracy. And what works against this is people who think that for reasons of security, we should keep the AI systems under lock and key because it's too dangerous to put it in the hands of everybody, because it could be used by terrorists or something. That would lead to potentially a very bad future in which all of our information diet is controlled by a small number of companies through proprietary systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you trust humans with this technology to build systems that are on the whole good for humanity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Isn't that what democracy and free speech is all about?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think so.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you trust institutions to do the right thing?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you trust people to do the right thing? And yeah, there's bad people who are going to do bad things, but they're not going to have superior technology to the good people. So then it's going to be my good AI against your bad AI, right? There's the examples that we were just talking about of maybe some rogue country will build some AI system that's going to try to convince everybody to go into a civil war or something or elect a favorable ruler, but then they will have to go past our AI systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. An AI system with a strong Russian accent will be trying to convince our-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And doesn't put any articles in their sentences.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it'll be at the very least, absurdly comedic. Okay. So since we talked about the physical reality, I'd love to ask your vision of the future with robots in this physical reality. So many of the kinds of intelligence that you've been speaking about would empower robots to be more effective collaborators with us humans. So since Tesla's Optimus team has been showing us some progress on humanoid robots, I think it really reinvigorated the whole industry that I think Boston Dynamics has been leading for a very, very long time. So now there's all kinds of companies Figure AI, obviously Boston Dynamics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Unitree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Unitree, but there's a lot of them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a few of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's great. It's great. I love it. So do you think there'll be millions of humanoid robots walking around soon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they can't build a domestic robot. We're still some distance away from completely autonomous level five driving, and we're certainly very far away from having level five autonomous driving by a system that can train itself by driving 20 hours like any 17-year-old. So until we have, again, world models, systems that can train themselves to understand how the world works, we're not going to have significant progress in robotics. So a lot of the people working on robotic hardware at the moment are betting or banking on the fact that AI is going to make sufficient progress towards that,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they're hoping to discover a product in it too. Because before you have a really strong world model, there'll be an almost strong world model and people are trying to find a product in a clumsy robot, I suppose, not a perfectly efficient robot. So there's the factory setting where humanoid robots can help automate some aspects of the factory. I think that's a crazy difficult task because of all the safety required and all this kind of stuff. I think in the home is more interesting, but then you start to think, I think you mentioned loading the dishwasher, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I suppose that's one of the main problems you're working on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's cleaning up, cleaning the house, clearing up the table after a meal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Washing the dishes, all those tasks, cooking. All the tasks that in principle could be automated but are actually incredibly sophisticated, really complicated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But even just basic navigation around a space full of uncertainty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That works. You can do this now, navigation is fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, navigation in a way that's compelling to us humans is a different thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>AI group at fair, and they've been not building their own robots, but using commercial robots. And you can tell the robot dog go to the fridge and they can actually open the fridge and they can probably pick up a can in the fridge and stuff like that and bring it to you. So it can navigate, it can grab objects as long as it's been trained to recognize them, which vision systems work pretty well nowadays, but it's not like a completely general robot that would be sophisticated enough to do things like clearing up the dinner table.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To me, that's an exciting future of getting humanoid robots, robots in general in the home more and more, because it gets humans to really directly interact with AI systems in the physical space. And in so doing it allows us to philosophically, psychologically explore our relationships with robots. Going to be really, really, really interesting. So I hope you make progress on the whole JEPA thing soon.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I hope things can work as planned. Again, we've been working on this idea of self supervised running from video for 10 years, and only made significant progress in the last two or three.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And actually you've mentioned that there's a lot of interesting breakage that can happen without having access to a lot of compute. So if you're interested in doing a PhD in this kind of stuff, there's a lot of possibilities still to do innovative work. So what advice would you give to an undergrad that's looking to go to grad school and do a PhD?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the obstacle, and then you can send this to a lower level planner that figures out how to move the legs to follow that trajectories. So that works, but that two level planning is designed by hand. We specify what the proper levels of abstraction, the representation at each level of abstraction have to be. How do you learn this? How do you learn that hierarchical representation of action plans? With [inaudible 02:37:21] and deep learning, we can train the system to learn hierarchical representations of percepts. What is the equivalent when what you're trying to represent are action plans?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For action plans, yeah. So you want basically a robot dog or humanoid robot that turns on and travels from New York to Paris all by itself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For example.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It might have some trouble at the TSA.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, but even doing something fairly simple like a household task, like cooking or something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a lot involved. It's a super complex task and once again, we take it for granted. What hope do you have for the future of humanity? We're talking about so many exciting technologies, so many exciting possibilities. What gives you hope when you look out over the next 10, 20, 50, a hundred years? If you look at social media, there's wars going on, there's division, there's hatred, all this kind of stuff that's also part of humanity. But amidst all that, what gives you hope?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this than I am, but when I talk to them, they tell us we're not going to run out of the job. This is not going to cause mass unemployment. This is just going to be gradual shift of different professions. The professions that are going to be hot 10 or 15 years from now, we have no idea today what they're going to be. The same way, if you go back 20 years in the past, who could have thought 20 years ago that the hottest job, even five, 10 years ago, was mobile app developer? Smartphones weren't invented.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Most of the jobs of the future might be in the Metaverse.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it could be, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the point is you can't possibly predict. But you're right. You made a lot of strong points. And I believe that people are fundamentally good. And so if AI, especially open source AI, can make them smarter, it just empowers the goodness in humans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I share that feeling, I think people are fundamentally good. And in fact, a lot of doomers are doomers because they don't think that people are fundamentally good, and they either don't trust people or they don't trust the institution to do the right thing so that people behave properly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think both you and I believe in humanity, and I think I speak for a lot of people in saying thank you for pushing the open source movement, pushing to making both research and AI open source, making it available to people, and also the models themselves, making it open source. So thank you for that. And thank you for speaking your mind in such colorful and beautiful ways on the internet. I hope you never stop. You're one of the most fun people I know and get to be a fan of. So Yann, thank you for speaking to me once again, and thank you for being you.<|eot_id|>"}
