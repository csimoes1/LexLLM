{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think having good hardware is part of the story, and people who think you don't need to innovate hardware anymore are wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Marc Raibert, a legendary roboticist, founder and longtime CEO of Boston Dynamics, and recently the Executive Director of the newly created Boston Dynamics AI Institute, that focuses on research and the cutting edge, on creating future generations of robots that are far better than anything that exists today. He has been leading the creation of incredible legged robots for over 40 years at CMU, at MIT, the legendary MIT Leg Lab, and then of course, Boston Dynamics with amazing robots like BigDog, Atlas, Spot, and Handle. This was a big honor and pleasure for me. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Marc Raibert. When did you first fall in love with robotics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a [inaudible 00:02:50] robot arm taken apart in probably a thousand pieces. And when I saw that, from that day on, I was a roboticist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember the year?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>1974.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>1974. So there's just this arm in pieces.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you saw the pieces and you saw in your vision the arm when it's put back together and the possibilities that holds.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>appealing idea. And so when I went back to the AI lab following him and I saw the arm, I just thought, \"This is it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so interesting, the tension between the BCS, brain cognitive science approach to understanding intelligence, and the robotics approach to understanding intelligence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>went away, and then there was another time in the '80s. And then recently the last five or so years, there's been a stronger connection.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you were always kind of a builder. What stands out to you in memory of a thing you've built, maybe a trivial thing that just kind of inspired you in the possibilities that this direction of work might hold?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think it was. And we would take those apart, fill them with match heads, put a tail on it and make it into little rockets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it wasn't always about function, it was, well...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Rocket was pretty [inaudible 00:05:32].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess that is pretty functional. But yeah, I guess that is a question. How much was it about function versus just creating something cool?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>add and combine with the lifelike things that the robots can do. But the heart of it is making them do things that are interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things that underlies a lot of your work is that the robots you create, the systems you have created for over 40 years now have a kind of, they're not cautious. So a lot of robots that people know about move about this world very cautiously, carefully, very afraid of the world. A lot of the robots you built, especially in the early days, were very aggressive under actuated. They're hopping, they're wild, moving quickly. So is there a philosophy under underlying that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>theory now. Maybe that won't pay off, but that's how I'm trying to think about it, trying to encourage our group to go at it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, we'll talk about what it means to what is the actual thing we're trying to optimize for a robot, sometimes, especially with human robot interaction, maybe flaws is a good thing. Perfection is not necessarily the right thing to be chasing. Just like you said, maybe being good at fumbling an object, being good at fumbling might be the right thing to optimize versus perfect modeling of the object and perfect movement of the arm to grasp that object as maybe perfection is not supposed to exist in the real world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a thing and none of them was grasping. She would nudge, roll, flatten with her knife, things like that. And none of them was grasping.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So okay, let's go back to the early days. First of all, you've created and led the Leg Lab, the legendary Leg Lab at MIT. So what was that first hopping robot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But first of all, the Leg Lab actually started at Carnegie Mellon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Carnegie Mellon.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was built in about 1984 or five, and really only got going about '86 or so, and took years of development to get it to...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's just pause here. For people who don't know, I'm talking to Mark Weber, founder of Boston Dynamics. But before that, you were a professor developing some of the most incredible robots for 15 years. And before that, of course, a grad student and all that. So you've been doing this for a really long time. You skipped over this, but go to the first hopping robot. There's videos of some of this. These are incredible robots. You talked about the very first step was to get a thing hopping up and down, and then you realized, well, balancing is a thing you should care about, and it's actually a solvable problem. Can you just go through how to create that robot? What was involved in creating that robot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>yet where I was going next, and then when I landed at CMU, he sent $250,000, which in 1980 was a lot of research money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you see the possibility of where this is going, why this is an important problem?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It has to do with leg locomotion. I mean, it has to do with all these problems that the human body solves when we're walking, for example. All the fundamentals are there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in my head. As an academic, I was mostly just trying to do the next thing, make some progress, impress my colleagues if I could.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And have fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And have fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pogo stick robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pogo stick robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what was on the technical side? What are some of the challenges of getting to the point where we saw in the video the pogo stick robot that's actually successfully hopping and then eventually doing flips and all this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all that? But it turned out not to be that hard to do, at least at the level of performance we achieved at the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. You mentioned inverted pendulum, but can you explain how a hopping stick in 3D can balance itself?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does the actuation look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time the foot's on the ground. You only can do it while the foot's on the ground in the air. The physics don't work out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How far does it have to tilt before it's too late to be able to balance itself or it's impossible to balance itself, correct itself?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You land your foot on the edge of the steps. There's other degrees of freedom to control if you're getting to more realistic, practical situations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it's really interesting to ask about the early days because believing in yourself, believing that there's something interesting here. And then you mentioned finding somebody else, Ben Brown. What's that like, finding other people with whom you can build this crazy idea and actually make it work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at it now, I look at Boston Dynamics and all the really excellent engineering there, people who really make stuff work, I'm only the dreamer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you talk about pogo stick robot or legged robots, whether it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots, did people doubt that this is possible? Did you experience a lot of people around you kind of...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know if they doubted whether it was possible, but I think they thought it was a waste of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, it's not even an interesting problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's been an inspiration to go out and attack these harder things. And I think legged locomotion has turned out to be a useful thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you ever have doubt about bringing Atlas to life, for example, or with Big Dog just every step of the way? Did you have doubt? This is too hard of a problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or even other technical people, there's a special thing that goes on, even though most of the humanoid robots aren't that much like a person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But we anthropomorphize and we see the humanity. But also with Spot, you can see not the humanity, but whatever we find compelling about social interactions there in Spot, as well.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to take pictures, want to pose for selfies, want to operate the robot, want to pet it, want to put clothes on it. It's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I love Spot. So if we move around history a little bit, so you said, I think, in the early days of Boston Dynamics that you quietly worked on making a running version of Aibo, Sony's robot dog.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just an interesting little tidbit of history for me. What stands out to your memory from that task? For people who don't know, that little dog robot moves slowly. How did that become Big Dog? What was involved there? What was the dance between how do we make this cute little dog versus a thing that can actually carry a lot of payload and move fast and stuff like that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it ever reached the market, even though they did show it. When I look back, I say that we got us back where we belonged.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you rediscovered the soul of the company.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so from there, it was always about robots.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you started Boston Dynamics in 1992.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some fond memories from the early days?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>company because we sort of understood who we were and what would work and what wouldn't. Even though technically it was really a fascinating thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was that meeting like, where you're just sitting at a table, \"You know what? We're going to pivot completely. We're going to let go of this thing we put so much hard work into and then go back to the thing it came from.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It just always felt right once we did it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just looked at each other and said, \"Let's build robots.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to like us and what we were doing. That was the real transition from us being a simulation company into being a robotics company again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was a quadruplet. The legs were four legs digital legs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, no, four legs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And what did you learn from that experience of building basically a fast moving quadruplet?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you had to watch a slow mo for it to look like it was interesting. If you watch it fast, it was just like a-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's funny.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so I was always focused on how's this going to look through the Viewfinder and running Aibo didn't look so cool through the Viewfinder.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what came next? What was a big next milestone in terms of a robot you built?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be willing to go out there out and build it, break it, fix it, which is sort of one of our mottos at the company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So testing it in the real world. For people who don't know BigDog, maybe you can correct me, but it's a big quadruplet four-legged robot. It looks big, could probably carry a lot of weight. Not the most weight that Boston Dynamics have built, but a lot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was a lot of learning just on building the physical robot and the system integration for that. And then there was the controls of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So for BigDog, you brought it all together onto one platform so-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You could take it out in the woods.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and you did.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot of challenge. And we spent a lot of time. Our team spent a lot of time down there hiking. Those were fun days.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hiking with the robot. So what did you learn about what it takes to balance a robot like that on a trail, on a hiking trail in the woods? Basically, forget the woods. Just the real world. That's the big leap into testing in the real world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>operate the robot the first time up and down and up and down. Whereas it taken us years to get there in the previous robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you fast-forward, BigDog eventually became Spot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So BigDog became LS3, which is the big load carrying one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just a quick pause, it can carry 400 pounds?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was designed to carry 400. But we had it carrying about a thousand pounds one time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course you did. Just to make sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so we had one carrying the other one. There's a little clip of that. We should put that out somewhere. That's from 20 years ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. And it can go for very long distances? You can travel the 20 miles.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Gasoline.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Gasoline, yeah. And that event just... Okay, sorry. So LS3 then how did that lead to Spot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>inspiration behind the spot pretty much as it exists today. We did a prototype the same size that was the first all electric, non-hydraulic robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the conversation with Larry Page about? Here's a guy that is very product focused and can see a vision for what the future holds. That's just interesting aside, what was the brainstorm about the future of robotics with him?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so intimidating like a big dog if it was in your house?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we could do that.\" And we started and did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a lot of technical challenges to go from hydraulic to electric?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pump filters, heat exchanger to keep it cool. Some valves all in this tiny little package. So hydraulics could still have a ways to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things that stands out about the robots Boston Dynamics have created is how beautiful the movement is, how natural the walking is, and running is, even flipping is, throwing is. So maybe you can talk about what's involved in making it look natural.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>looking. It says, okay, where am I now? I'm going to try and adjust for that. But you really need to think about what's coming.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how far ahead you do, you have to look in time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the landing, you have to, at the time of launch, have momentum and rotation, all those things coordinated so that a landing is within reach.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it to stick a landing? I mean, it's very much under actuated. In the air, you don't have as much control about anything. So how hard is it to get that to work? First of all, did flips with a hopping robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>abilities and he was an engineer, so he could translate some of that into the math and the algorithms that you need to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He knew how humans do it. You just have to get robots to do the same.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>coached, we have ways of learning, but do we really understand in a physics way what we're doing? Probably most gymnasts and athletes don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some way, by building robots, you are in part understanding how humans do walking. Most of us walk without considering how we walk really and how we make it so natural and efficient, all those kinds of things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a person. Even though it's been getting closer and closer. The running might be close to a human, but the walking is still a challenge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's interesting, right? That running is closer to a human. It just shows that the more aggressive and the more you leap into the unknown, the more natural it is. I mean, walking is kind of falling always right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we used to have a motto at the Boston Dynamics in the early days, which was you have to run before you can walk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good motto because you also had Wildcat, which was one of along the way towards Spot, which is a quadruplet that went 19 miles an hour on flat terrain. Is that the fastest you've ever built?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Might be the fastest quadruplet in the world. I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}

Complaining about how loud it was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So at the leg lab, I believe most of the robots didn't have knees. How do you figure out what is the right number of actuators? What are the joints to have? What do you need to have? We humans have knees and all kinds of interesting stuff on the feet. The toe is an important part, I guess, for humans, or maybe it's not. I injured my toe recently and it made running very unpleasant. So that seems to be important. So how do you figure out for efficiency, for function, for aesthetics, how many joints to have, how many actuaries to have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the time. So my job was to say, okay, well let's do something simpler to get started and maybe we'll get there at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just love the idea that you two were studying kangaroos and ostriches.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, we did. We filmed and digitized data from horses.

And that'll be the way it is with humanoids at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of humanoids and you're just not even...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>robotics is a big challenge. There's the warehouse use case.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's old-fashioned robots. I mean, there's fixed arms doing manufacturing. I don't want to say that they're not making money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... Industrial robotics, yes. But there's got to be a moment when social robotics starts making real money. Meaning a Spot type robot in the home and there's tens of millions of them in the home and they're, I don't know, how many dogs there are in the United States as pets.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Many.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It feels there's something we love about having a intelligent companion with us that remembers us, that's excited to see us. All that stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not that easy to do that. Getting performance, safety and cost all to be where they need to be at the same time, that's hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also some of it is, like you say, you can have a product but people might not be aware of it. So also part of it is the videos or however you connect with the public, the culture and create the category. Make people realize this is the thing you want. There's a lot of negative perceptions you can have. Do you really want a system with the camera in your home walking around? If it's presented correctly and if there's the right boundaries around it and you understand how it works and so on, a lot of people would want to. And if they don't, they might be suspicious of it. So that's an important one. We all use smartphones and that has a camera that's looking at us.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It has two or three or four.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's listening.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as you work on the cognitive aspect of these robots, do you think we'll ever get to human level or superhuman level intelligence? There's been a lot of conversations about this recently, given the rapid development in large language models.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>seems to be happening about AGI's puzzles me. So I ask you a question, do you think there's anybody smarter than you in the world?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Absolutely, yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you find that threatening?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a threat, especially since they could easily be smarter but still available to us or under our control, which is basically how computers generally are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the fear is that they would be 10x or 100x smarter and operating under different morals and ethical codes than humans naturally do, and so almost become misaligned in unintended ways and therefore harm humans in ways we just can't predict. And even if we program them to do a thing, on the way of doing that thing, they would cause a lot of harm. And when they're 100 times, 1,000 times, 10,000 times smarter than us, we won't be able to stop it or we won't be able to even see the harm as it's happening until it's too late. That stuff. So you can construct all possible trajectories of how the world ends because of super intelligent systems.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and do that. A lot of people think that they're in a channel and there's only limited opportunities, but it's usually wider than they think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The opportunities really are limitless. But at the same time, you want to pick a thing and it's the diligence and really, really pursue it. And really pursue it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Oh, absolutely. It can take a while.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, you've been doing this for 40 plus years.<|eot_id|>"}

The incremental improvement. A robot being really terrible at a task and then slowly becoming better. Even in athletic intelligence, honestly. Learning to walk and falling and slowly figuring that out, I think there's something extremely compelling about that. We like flaws, especially with the cognitive task. It's okay to be clumsy.
