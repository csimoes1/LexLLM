{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think having good hardware is part of the story, and people who think you don't need to innovate hardware anymore are wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Marc Raibert, a legendary roboticist, founder and longtime CEO of Boston Dynamics, and recently the Executive Director of the newly created Boston Dynamics AI Institute, that focuses on research and the cutting edge, on creating future generations of robots that are far better than anything that exists today. He has been leading the creation of incredible legged robots for over 40 years at CMU, at MIT, the legendary MIT Leg Lab, and then of course, Boston Dynamics with amazing robots like BigDog, Atlas, Spot, and Handle. This was a big honor and pleasure for me. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Marc Raibert. When did you first fall in love with robotics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and electronics, and from a young age, I would watch him assembling an ICO kit or something like that. I still have a couple of his old ICO kits. But it was really during graduate school when I followed a professor back from class. It was Berthold Horn at MIT, and I was taking an interim class. It's IAP, Independent Activities Period. And I followed him back to his lab, and on the table was a [inaudible 00:02:50] robot arm taken apart in probably a thousand pieces. And when I saw that, from that day on, I was a roboticist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember the year?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>1974.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>1974. So there's just this arm in pieces.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you saw the pieces and you saw in your vision the arm when it's put back together and the possibilities that holds.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>an electrical engineer as an undergrad at Northeastern. And the neurophysiology wasn't really working for me. It wasn't conceptual enough. I couldn't see really how by looking at single neurons, you were going to get to a place where you could understand control systems or thought or anything like that. And the AI lab was always an appealing. This was before, [inaudible 00:03:47]. This was in the '70s. So the AI lab was always an appealing idea. And so when I went back to the AI lab following him and I saw the arm, I just thought, \"This is it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so interesting, the tension between the BCS, brain cognitive science approach to understanding intelligence, and the robotics approach to understanding intelligence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is trying to bridge that gap. And even when I was there, David Maher was in the AI lab. David Maher had models of the brain that were appealing both to biologists but also to computer people. So he was a visitor in the AI lab at the time, and I guess he became full-time there. So that was the first time a bridge was made between those two groups then the bridge kind of went away, and then there was another time in the '80s. And then recently the last five or so years, there's been a stronger connection.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you were always kind of a builder. What stands out to you in memory of a thing you've built, maybe a trivial thing that just kind of inspired you in the possibilities that this direction of work might hold?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We were just doing gadgets when we were kids. I have a friend, we were taking the... I don't know if everybody remembers, but fluorescent lights had this little aluminum cylinder, I can't even remember what it's called now that you needed a starter, I think it was. And we would take those apart, fill them with match heads, put a tail on it and make it into little rockets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it wasn't always about function, it was, well...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Rocket was pretty [inaudible 00:05:32].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess that is pretty functional. But yeah, I guess that is a question. How much was it about function versus just creating something cool?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>anything, it would look like a pile of junk, which a lot of my robots looked like in those days. But then when it started moving, you'd get the idea that it had some kind of life or some kind of interest in its movement, and I think we purposely even designed the machines not worrying about the aesthetics of the structure itself. But then it turns out that the aesthetics of the thing itself add and combine with the lifelike things that the robots can do. But the heart of it is making them do things that are interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things that underlies a lot of your work is that the robots you create, the systems you have created for over 40 years now have a kind of, they're not cautious. So a lot of robots that people know about move about this world very cautiously, carefully, very afraid of the world. A lot of the robots you built, especially in the early days, were very aggressive under actuated. They're hopping, they're wild, moving quickly. So is there a philosophy under underlying that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can position it with respect to that, and then you grasp it carefully and then you move it. Well, that's not anything like how people and animals work. We juggle in our hands, we hug multiple objects and can sort them. So. Now to be fair, being more aggressive is going to mean things aren't going to work very well for a while, so it's a longer term approach to the problem, and that's just theory now. Maybe that won't pay off, but that's how I'm trying to think about it, trying to encourage our group to go at it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, we'll talk about what it means to what is the actual thing we're trying to optimize for a robot, sometimes, especially with human robot interaction, maybe flaws is a good thing. Perfection is not necessarily the right thing to be chasing. Just like you said, maybe being good at fumbling an object, being good at fumbling might be the right thing to optimize versus perfect modeling of the object and perfect movement of the arm to grasp that object as maybe perfection is not supposed to exist in the real world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know if you know my friend Matt Mason, who is the director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, and we go back to graduate school together, but he analyzed a movie of Julia Child's doing a cooking thing, and she did, I think he said something like there were 40 different ways that she handled a thing and none of them was grasping. She would nudge, roll, flatten with her knife, things like that. And none of them was grasping.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So okay, let's go back to the early days. First of all, you've created and led the Leg Lab, the legendary Leg Lab at MIT. So what was that first hopping robot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But first of all, the Leg Lab actually started at Carnegie Mellon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Carnegie Mellon.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was a professor there starting in 1980, about 1986, so that's where the first topping machines were built. I guess we got the first one working in about 1982, something like that. That was a simplified one. Then we got a three-dimensional one in 1983, the quadruped that we built at the Leg Lab, the first version was built in about 1984 or five, and really only got going about '86 or so, and took years of development to get it to...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's just pause here. For people who don't know, I'm talking to Mark Weber, founder of Boston Dynamics. But before that, you were a professor developing some of the most incredible robots for 15 years. And before that, of course, a grad student and all that. So you've been doing this for a really long time. You skipped over this, but go to the first hopping robot. There's videos of some of this. These are incredible robots. You talked about the very first step was to get a thing hopping up and down, and then you realized, well, balancing is a thing you should care about, and it's actually a solvable problem. Can you just go through how to create that robot? What was involved in creating that robot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>program manager. And so we went in, I had a little Samsonite suitcase, which we opened, and it had just the skeleton of this one-legged hopping robot. And we showed it to him, and you could almost see the drool going down his chin of excitement. And he sent me $250,000. He said, \"Okay, I want to fund this.\" And I was between institutions, I was just about to leave JPL, and I hadn't decided yet where I was going next, and then when I landed at CMU, he sent $250,000, which in 1980 was a lot of research money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you see the possibility of where this is going, why this is an important problem?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It has to do with leg locomotion. I mean, it has to do with all these problems that the human body solves when we're walking, for example. All the fundamentals are there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think that was the motivation to try and get more at the fundamentals of how animals work, but the idea that it would result in machines that were anything practical like we're making now, that wasn't anywhere in my head. As an academic, I was mostly just trying to do the next thing, make some progress, impress my colleagues if I could.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And have fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And have fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pogo stick robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pogo stick robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what was on the technical side? What are some of the challenges of getting to the point where we saw in the video the pogo stick robot that's actually successfully hopping and then eventually doing flips and all this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to explain these without you seeing them, but you probably know what I'm talking about, a planarize. And then the next big step was to make it work in 3D, which that was really the scary part with these simple things. People had inverted pendulums at the time for years, and they could control them by driving a cart back and forth, but could you make it work in three dimensions while it's bouncing and all that? But it turned out not to be that hard to do, at least at the level of performance we achieved at the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. You mentioned inverted pendulum, but can you explain how a hopping stick in 3D can balance itself?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does the actuation look like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>foot, and we did something relatively simple. And then there's a third part to keep the body at an attitude that's upright, because if it gets too far, you could hop and just keep rotating around. But if it gets too far, then you run out of motion of the joints at the hips. So you have to do that. And we did that by applying a torque between the legs and the body. Every time the foot's on the ground. You only can do it while the foot's on the ground in the air. The physics don't work out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How far does it have to tilt before it's too late to be able to balance itself or it's impossible to balance itself, correct itself?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>us, some people working for others, people came up with all kinds of equations or algorithms for how to do a better job, be able to go faster. One of my students worked on getting things to go faster. Another one worked on climbing over obstacles. Because when you're running on the open ground, it's one thing; if you're running up a stair, you have to adjust where you are, otherwise things don't work out. You land your foot on the edge of the steps. There's other degrees of freedom to control if you're getting to more realistic, practical situations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it's really interesting to ask about the early days because believing in yourself, believing that there's something interesting here. And then you mentioned finding somebody else, Ben Brown. What's that like, finding other people with whom you can build this crazy idea and actually make it work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably the smartest thing I ever did is to find the other people. When I look at it now, I look at Boston Dynamics and all the really excellent engineering there, people who really make stuff work, I'm only the dreamer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you talk about pogo stick robot or legged robots, whether it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots, did people doubt that this is possible? Did you experience a lot of people around you kind of...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know if they doubted whether it was possible, but I think they thought it was a waste of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, it's not even an interesting problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think for a lot of people. I think it's been both, though. Some people, I felt like they were saying, \"Oh, why are you wasting your time on this stupid problem?\" But then I've been at many things where people have told me it's been an inspiration to go out and attack these harder things. And I think legged locomotion has turned out to be a useful thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you ever have doubt about bringing Atlas to life, for example, or with Big Dog just every step of the way? Did you have doubt? This is too hard of a problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>functionality. And also, there's an aspect to humanoid robots that's about about the cosmetics, where there isn't really other functionality, and that kind of is off putting for me. As a roboticist, I think the functionality really matters. So probably that's why I avoided the humanoid robots to start with. But I'll tell you, after we started working on them, you could see that the connection and the impact with other people, whether they're laypeople or even other technical people, there's a special thing that goes on, even though most of the humanoid robots aren't that much like a person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But we anthropomorphize and we see the humanity. But also with Spot, you can see not the humanity, but whatever we find compelling about social interactions there in Spot, as well.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well. I'll tell you, I go around giving talks and take Spot to a lot of them, and it's amazing. The media likes to say that they're terrifying and that people are afraid, and YouTube commenters like to say that it's frightening. But when you take a Spot out there, maybe it's self-selecting, but you get a crowd of people who want to take pictures, want to pose for selfies, want to operate the robot, want to pet it, want to put clothes on it. It's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I love Spot. So if we move around history a little bit, so you said, I think, in the early days of Boston Dynamics that you quietly worked on making a running version of Aibo, Sony's robot dog.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just an interesting little tidbit of history for me. What stands out to your memory from that task? For people who don't know, that little dog robot moves slowly. How did that become Big Dog? What was involved there? What was the dance between how do we make this cute little dog versus a thing that can actually carry a lot of payload and move fast and stuff like that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a few years of overlap, but the concept wasn't to start a robot company. The concept was to use this dynamic simulation tool that we developed to do robotics for other things. But working with Sony, we got back into robotics by doing the IBO Runner, we made some tools for programming Curio, which was a small humanoid this big that could do some dancing and other kinds of fun stuff. And I don't think it ever reached the market, even though they did show it. When I look back, I say that we got us back where we belonged.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you rediscovered the soul of the company.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so from there, it was always about robots.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you started Boston Dynamics in 1992.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some fond memories from the early days?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>marketing activity. The company was all bootstrapped in those years. We never had investors until Google bought us, which was after 20 years. So we didn't have any resources to go after hospitals. So one day, Rob and I were looking at that and we'd built another simulator for knee arthroscopy and we said, \"This isn't going to work.\" And we killed it. And we moved on. And that was really a milestone in the company because we sort of understood who we were and what would work and what wouldn't. Even though technically it was really a fascinating thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was that meeting like, where you're just sitting at a table, \"You know what? We're going to pivot completely. We're going to let go of this thing we put so much hard work into and then go back to the thing it came from.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It just always felt right once we did it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just looked at each other and said, \"Let's build robots.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>internet and Zoom and anything like that. So we had six ISDN lines installed and we would have a telecon every week that worked at very low frame rates, something like 10 hertz. English across the boundary with Japan was a challenge trying to understand what each of us was saying and have meetings every week for several years doing that. And it was a pleasure working with them. They were really supporters. They seemed to like us and what we were doing. That was the real transition from us being a simulation company into being a robotics company again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was a quadruplet. The legs were four legs digital legs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, no, four legs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And what did you learn from that experience of building basically a fast moving quadruplet?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mostly we learned that something that small doesn't look very exciting when it's running. It's like it's scampering and you had to watch a slow mo for it to look like it was interesting. If you watch it fast, it was just like a-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's funny.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of my things was to show stuff in video from the very early days of the hopping machines. And so I was always focused on how's this going to look through the Viewfinder and running Aibo didn't look so cool through the Viewfinder.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what came next? What was a big next milestone in terms of a robot you built?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at DARPA starting a biodynamics program. And he put out a request for proposals and I think there were 42 proposals written and three got funded. One was BigDog, one was a climbing robot rise, and that put things in motion. We hired Martin Bueller, he was a professor in Montreal at McGill. He was incredibly important for getting BigDog out of the lab and into the mud, which was a key step to really be willing to go out there out and build it, break it, fix it, which is sort of one of our mottos at the company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So testing it in the real world. For people who don't know BigDog, maybe you can correct me, but it's a big quadruplet four-legged robot. It looks big, could probably carry a lot of weight. Not the most weight that Boston Dynamics have built, but a lot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bus connected to the robot. And the robot itself just had the actuators. It had gyroscopes for sensing and some other sensors, but all the power and computing was off board. BigDog had all that stuff integrated on the platform. It had a gasoline engine for power, which was a very complicated thing to undertake. It had to convert the rotation of the engine into hydraulic power, which is how we actuated it. So there was a lot of learning just on building the physical robot and the system integration for that. And then there was the controls of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So for BigDog, you brought it all together onto one platform so-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You could take it out in the woods.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and you did.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We did. We spent a lot of time down at the Marine Corps base in Quantico where there was a trail called the Guadalcanal Trail. And our milestone that DARPA had specified was that we could go on this one particular trail that involved a lot of challenge. And we spent a lot of time. Our team spent a lot of time down there hiking. Those were fun days.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hiking with the robot. So what did you learn about what it takes to balance a robot like that on a trail, on a hiking trail in the woods? Basically, forget the woods. Just the real world. That's the big leap into testing in the real world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all the visual perception going up the Guadalcanal Trail. So there was an operator who was right there who was very skilled even though the robot was balancing itself and placing its own feet, if the operator didn't do the right thing, it wouldn't go. But years later, we went back with one of the electric, the precursor to Spot, and we had advanced the controls and everything so much that a complete amateur could operate the robot the first time up and down and up and down. Whereas it taken us years to get there in the previous robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you fast-forward, BigDog eventually became Spot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So BigDog became LS3, which is the big load carrying one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just a quick pause, it can carry 400 pounds?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was designed to carry 400. But we had it carrying about a thousand pounds one time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course you did. Just to make sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We had one carrying the other one. We had two of them, so we had one carrying the other one. There's a little clip of that. We should put that out somewhere. That's from 20 years ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. And it can go for very long distances? You can travel the 20 miles.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Gasoline.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Gasoline, yeah. And that event just... Okay, sorry. So LS3 then how did that lead to Spot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So BigDog and LS3 had engine power and hydraulic actuation. Then we made a robot that was electric power. So there's a battery driving a motor, driving a pump, but still hydraulic actuation. Larry asked us, \"Could you make something that weighed 60 pounds, that would not be so intimidating if you had it in a house where there were people.\" And that was the inspiration behind the spot pretty much as it exists today. We did a prototype the same size that was the first all electric, non-hydraulic robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the conversation with Larry Page about? Here's a guy that is very product focused and can see a vision for what the future holds. That's just interesting aside, what was the brainstorm about the future of robotics with him?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, it was almost as simple as what I just said. We were having meeting, he said, \"Do you think you could make a smaller one that wouldn't be so intimidating like a big dog if it was in your house?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we could do that.\" And we started and did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a lot of technical challenges to go from hydraulic to electric?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>computing that could get you much more efficient use. They were much smaller and lighter so the whole robot could be smaller and lighter. We made a hydraulic power supply that had a bunch of components integrated in this tiny package. It's about this big, the size of a football weighs five kilograms and it produces five kilowatts of power. Of course it has to have a battery operating, but it's got a motor, a pump filters, heat exchanger to keep it cool. Some valves all in this tiny little package. So hydraulics could still have a ways to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things that stands out about the robots Boston Dynamics have created is how beautiful the movement is, how natural the walking is, and running is, even flipping is, throwing is. So maybe you can talk about what's involved in making it look natural.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hardware anymore are wrong, in my opinion. So I think one of the things, certainly in the early years for me, taking a dynamic approach where you think about what's the evolution of the motion of the thing going to be in the future and having a prediction of that that's used at the time that you're giving signals to it, as opposed to it all being sing, which is sing is sort of backward looking. It says, okay, where am I now? I'm going to try and adjust for that. But you really need to think about what's coming.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how far ahead you do, you have to look in time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>let's do that again and see what's happening. And you're looking at what the obstacles are, where the feet are going to be placed. You have to coordinate a lot of things. If you have obstacles and you're balancing at the same time and it's that limited horizon type calculation that's doing a lot of that. But if you're doing something like a somersault, you're looking out a lot further. If you want to stick the landing, you have to, at the time of launch, have momentum and rotation, all those things coordinated so that a landing is within reach.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it to stick a landing? I mean, it's very much under actuated. In the air, you don't have as much control about anything. So how hard is it to get that to work? First of all, did flips with a hopping robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we were at MIT, which is when we made a two-legged robot do a 3D somersault for the first time. There, in order to get enough rotation rate you needed to do tucking also, withdraw the legs in order to accelerate it. And he did some really fascinating work on how you stabilize more complicated maneuvers. You remember he was a gymnast at Champion Gymnast before he'd come to me. So he had the physical abilities and he was an engineer, so he could translate some of that into the math and the algorithms that you need to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He knew how humans do it. You just have to get robots to do the same.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Unfortunately though, humans don't really know how they do it, right. We are coached, we have ways of learning, but do we really understand in a physics way what we're doing? Probably most gymnasts and athletes don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some way, by building robots, you are in part understanding how humans do walking. Most of us walk without considering how we walk really and how we make it so natural and efficient, all those kinds of things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Atlas still doesn't walk like a person and it still doesn't walk quite as gracefully as a person.

The running might be close to a human, but the walking is still a challenge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's interesting, right? That running is closer to a human. It just shows that the more aggressive and the more you leap into the unknown, the more natural it is. I mean, walking is kind of falling always right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And something weird about the knee that you can do this folding and unfolding and get it to work out just a human can get it to work out just right, there's compliances.

Well, we used to have a motto at the Boston Dynamics in the early days, which was you have to run before you can walk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good motto because you also had Wildcat, which was one of along the way towards Spot, which is a quadruplet that went 19 miles an hour on flat terrain. Is that the fastest you've ever built?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Might be the fastest quadruplet in the world. I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For a quadruplet, probably. Of course, it was probably the loudest too. So we had this little racing go-kart engine on it, and we would get people from three buildings away sending us... Complaining about how loud it was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So at the leg lab, I believe most of the robots didn't have knees. How do you figure out what is the right number of actuators? What are the joints to have? What do you need to have? We humans have knees and all kinds of interesting stuff on the feet. The toe is an important part, I guess, for humans, or maybe it's not. I injured my toe recently and it made running very unpleasant. So that seems to be important. So how do you figure out for efficiency, for function, for aesthetics, how many joints to have, how many actuaries to have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some of the things that are important in human locomotion without it looking like it, without having a knee, an ankle. I'll tell you the first sketch that Ben Brown made when we were talking about building this thing, was a very complicated thing with zillions of springs, lots of joints. It looked much more like a kangaroo or an ostrich or something like that. Things we were paying a lot of attention to at the time. So my job was to say, okay, well let's do something simpler to get started and maybe we'll get there at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just love the idea that you two were studying kangaroos and ostriches.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, we did. We filmed and digitized data from horses. I did a dissection of ostrich at one point, which has absolutely remarkable legs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Dumb question. Do ostriches have a lot of musculature on the legs or no?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Most of it's up in the feathers, but there's a huge amount going on in the feathers, including a knee joint. The knee joint's way up there. The thing that's halfway down the leg that looks like a backwards knee is actually the ankle. The thing on the ground which looks like the foot is actually the toes. It's an extended toe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But the basic morphology is the same in all these animals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is the most beautiful movement of an animal?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The slow mos of cheetahs running are incredible. There's so much back motion and grace, and of course they're moving very fast. The animals running away from the cheetah are pretty exciting. The pronghorn, which they do this all four legs at once, jump called the prog, especially if there's a group of them, to confuse whoever's chasing them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they do a misdirection type of thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. They do a misdirection thing. The front on views of the cheetahs running fast where the tail is whipping around to help in the turns to help stabilize in the turns. That's pretty exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because they spend a lot of time in the air, I guess, as they're running that fast.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But they also turn very fast.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that a tail thing or is do you have to have contact with ground?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When did the knees first come into play in you building legged robots?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's... I mean, it's a technical thing about negative work when you're contracting a joint, but you're pushing out, that's negative work. And if you don't have a place to store that, it can be very expensive to do negative work. And in BigDog, there was no place to store negative work in the knees. But BigDog also had pogo stick springs down below. So part of the action was to comply in a bouncing motion. Later on in Spot, we took that out. As we got further and further away from the leg lab, we had more energy-driven controls.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something to be said about needs that go forward versus backward?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the late 80s, started to work on that. And he made this legged system that could walk down an incline plane where the legs folded and unfolded and swung forward, do the whole walking motion where there was no computer. There were some adjustments to the mechanics so that there were dampers and springs in some places that helped the mechanical action happen. It was essentially a mechanical computer. And the interesting idea there is that it's not all about the brain dictating to the body what the body should do. The body is a participant in the motion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a great design for a robot has a mechanical component where the movement is efficient even without a brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you design that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that these days most robots aren't doing that. Most robots are basically using the computer to govern the motion. Now, the brain though is taking into account what the mechanical thing can do and how it's going to behave. Otherwise, it would have to really forcefully move everything around all the time which probably some solutions do, but I think you end up with a more efficient and more graceful thing if you're taking into account what the machine wants to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this might be a good place to mention that you're now leading up the Boston Dynamics AI Institute newly formed, which is focused more on designing the robots of the future. I think one of the things, maybe you can tell me the big vision for what's going on, but one of the things is this idea that hardware still matters with organic design and so on. Maybe before that, can you zoom out and tell me what the vision is for the AI Institute?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to satisfy our dreams, they need to be smarter. So the AI Institute is designed to combine that physicality of the athletic side with the cognitive side. For instance, we're trying to make robots that can watch a human do a task, understand what it's seeing, and then do the task itself. OJT, on-the-job training for robots as a paradigm. Now, that's pretty hard, and it's sort of science fiction, but our idea is to work on a longer timeframe and work on solving those kinds of problems. I have a whole list of things that are in that vein.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe we can just take many of the things you mentioned, just take it as a tangent. First of all, athletic intelligence is a super cool term. And that really is intelligence. We humans take it for granted that we're so good at walking and moving about the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And using our hands.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Using your hands.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look at all the things I can do, right? I can juggle them, I'm rotating it this way, I can rotate it without looking.

And I don't think we have much of a clue how all that works yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I really like putting that under the banner of athletic intelligence. What are the big open problems in athletic intelligence? Boston Dynamics, with Spot, with Atlas, just have shown time and time again, pushed the limits of what we think is possible with robots. But where do we stand actually, if we zoom out. What are the big open problems on the athletic intelligence side?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, one question you could ask, that isn't my question, but are they commercially viable? Will they increase productivity? And I think we're getting very close to that. I don't think we're quite there still. Most of the robotics companies, it's a struggle. It's really the lack of the cognitive side that probably is the biggest barrier at the moment, even for the physically successful robots.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work reliably. And it's very exciting that they've done that. But it takes a huge effort to get that reliability in the robot. There's cost too, you'd like to get the cost down. Spots are still pretty expensive, and I don't think that they have to be, but it takes a different kind of activity to do that. I think that Boston Dynamics is owned primarily by Hyundai now, and I think that the skills of Hyundai in making cars can be brought to bear in making robots that are less expensive and more reliable and those kinds of things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the cognitive side for the AI Institute, what's the trade-off between moonshot projects for you and maybe incremental progress?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>year without seeing a tangible status report of where you are, which is the stepping stone, and it could be a simplification, you don't necessarily have to solve all the problems of your target goal, even though your target goal is going to take several years, those stepping stone results give you feedback, give motivation, because usually there's some success in there. So that's the mantra we've been working on, and that's pretty much how I'd say Boston Dynamics has worked, where you make progress and show it as you go. Show it to yourself, if not to the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does success look like? What are some of the milestones you're chasing?<|eot_id|>"}

And we've been developing skills as well. So we have multiple stabs at the pieces of doing that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it is, but there's some parts of it that aren't, like putting the seat into the...

We came in here, all we did is adjust the chair, but we didn't say anything about the room and we could navigate it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Zurich office. So we have a healthy learning component. But there's part of me that still says, if you look out in the world at what the most impressive performances are, they're still pretty much, I hate to use the word traditional, but that's what everybody's calling it, traditional controls, like model predictive control. The Atlas performances that you've seen are mostly model predictive control. They've started to do some learning stuff that's really incredible. I don't know if it's all been shown yet, but you'll see it over time. And then Marco has done some great stuff and others.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So especially for the athletic intelligence piece, the traditional approach seems to be the one that still performs the best.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure. Technical fearlessness means being willing to take on a problem that you don't know how to solve, and study it, figure out an entry point, maybe a simplified version, or a simplified solution or something, learn from the stepping stone, and go back and eventually make a solution that meets your goals.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People have criticized, especially the Big Dog videos, where there's a human driving the robot. And I understand the criticism now. At the time we wanted to just show, \"Look, this thing's using its legs to get up the hill.\" So we focused on showing that, which was, we thought, the story. The fact that there was a human... So they were thinking about autonomy, whereas we were thinking about the mobility. So we've adjusted to a lot of things that we see that people care about, trying to be honest. We've always tried to be honest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also just show cool stuff in its raw form, the limits of the system.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that is, robotics is hard, it's not going to work right right away, so don't be discouraged, is all it really means. Usually, when I talk about these things, I show videos, and I show a long string of outtakes. You have to have courage to be intrepid, when you work so hard to build your machine, and then you're trying it, and it just doesn't do what you thought it would do, what you want it to do, and you have to stick to it and keep trying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, we don't often see that, the story behind Spot and Atlas. How many failures were there along the way to get a working Atlas, a working Spot, in the early days, even a working Big Dog?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but once it did it had a high percentage of success. So it's not like we're cheating by just showing the best one, but we do show the evolved performance, not everything along the way. But everything along the way is informative. And it shows there's stupid things that go wrong, like the robot, just when you say go and it collapses right there on the start, that doesn't have to do with the steps. Or the perception didn't work right, so you miss the target when you jump, or something breaks and there's oil flying everywhere. But that's fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So the hardware failures and maybe some software-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Lots of control of evolution during that time. I think it took six weeks to get those 109 trials, because there was programming going on. It was actually robot learning, but there were human in the loop helping with the learning.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you protect Atlas from not getting damaged from 109 attempts?<|eot_id|>"}

You got to figure that in if you're going to do this kind of work. I sometimes criticize the people who have their gold-plated thing and they keep it on the shelf and they're afraid to use it. I don't think you can make progress if you're working that way. You need to be ready to have it break and go in there and fix it. It's part of the thing. Plan your budget so you have spare parts and a crew and all that stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If it falls 109 times, it's okay. Wow. So, intrepid, truly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>being an engineer is good. I think the third thing is that if you're lucky to be working in a team where you're getting the benefit of other people's skills that are helping you do your thing. None of us has all the skills needed to do most of these projects, and if you have a team where you're working well with the others, that can be very satisfying. Then if you're an engineer, you also usually get paid. So you kind of get paid four times in my view of the world. So what could be better than that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Get paid to have fun. What do you love about engineering? When you say engineering, what does that mean to you exactly? What is this big thing that we call engineering?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's both being a scientist, or getting to use science, at the same time as being an artist or a creator. Scientists only get to study what's out there, and engineers get to make stuff that didn't exist before. So it's really, I think, a higher calling, even though I think most the public out there thinks science is top and engineering is somehow secondary, but I think it's the other way around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And at the cutting edge, I think, when you talk about robotics, there is a possibility to do art in that you do the first of its kind thing. Then there's the production at scale, which is its own beautiful thing. But when you do the first new robot or the first new thing, that's a possibility to create something totally new, that is art.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bringing metal to life, or a machine to life, is fun.

Especially when it's at the scale that humans can perceive and appreciate directly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But I think, with going back to the pieces of that, you design a linkage that turns out to be half the weight and just as strong, that's very satisfying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's [inaudible 01:16:49], yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think having the robots move in a way that's evocative of life is pretty exciting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the elegance of movement.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Or if it's a high performance act where it's doing it faster, bigger than other robots. Usually we're not doing it bigger, faster than people, but we're getting there in a few narrow dimensions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So faster, bigger, smoother, more elegant, more graceful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, I'd like to do dancing that starts... We're nowhere near the dancing capabilities of a human. We've been having a ballerina in, who's kind of a well-known ballerina, and she's been programming the robot. We've been working on the tools that can make it so that she can use her way of talking, way of doing a choreography or something like that, more accessible, to get the robot to do things, and starting to produce some interesting stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, we should mention that there is a choreography tool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess- Tool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean I guess I saw versions of it, which is pretty cool. You can, at slices of time, control different parts at the high level, the movement of the robot, Spot and other-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We hope to take that forward and make it more tuned to how the dance world wants to talk, wants to communicate and get better performances. I mean, we've done a lot, but there's still a lot possible. And I'd like to have performances where the robots are dancing with people. So right now almost everything that we've done on dancing is to a fixed time base. So once you press go, the robot does its thing and plays out its thing. It's not listening, it's not watching. But I think it should do those things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think I would love to see a professional ballerina, alone in her room with a robot, slowly teaching the robot. Just actually, the process of a clueless robot trying to figure out a small little piece of a dance. Because right now, Atlas and Spot have done perfect dancing to a beat and so on, to a degree, but the learning process of interacting with a human would be incredible to watch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of the cool things going on, you know that there's a class at Brown University called Choreorobotics? Sidney Skybetter is a dancer, choreographer and he teamed up with Stefanie Tellex, who's a computer science professor, and they taught this class and I think they have some graduate students helping teach it, where they have two spots and people come in. I think it's 50/50 of computer science people and dance people, and they program performances that are very interesting. I show some of them sometimes when I give a talk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And making that process of a human teaching the robot more efficient, more intuitive, maybe partial language, part movement. That'd be really fascinating because one of the things I've realized is humans communicate with movement a lot. It's not just language, there's a lot. There's body language, there's so many intricate little things. To watch a human and Spot communicate back and forth with movement, I mean there's just so many wonderful possibilities there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it's also a challenge. We get asked to have our robots perform with famous dancers and they have 200 degrees of freedom or something, every little ripple and thing, and they have all this head and neck and shoulders and stuff, and the robots mostly don't have all that stuff and it's a daunting challenge to not look physically stupid next to them. So we've pretty much avoided that performance, but we'll get to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think even with the limited degrees of freedom, we could still have some sass and flavor and so on. You can figure out your own thing even if you can't-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And we can reverse things. If you watch a human do a robot animation, which is a dance style where you jerk around and you pop and lock and all that stuff, I think the robots could show up the humans by doing unstable oscillations and things that are faster than a person could. So that's on my plan, but I haven't quite gotten there yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned about building teams and robotics teams and so on. How do you find great engineers? How do you hire great engineers?<|eot_id|>"}

I think you got to find people who love it. In the early days, we paid a little less so we only got people who were doing it because they really loved it. We also hired people who might not have professional degrees, people who were building bicycles and building kayaks. We have some people who come from the maker world, and that's really important for the work we do, to have that be part of the mix.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Whatever that is. Whatever the magic ingredient that makes a great builder, maker. That's the big part of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People who repaired their cars or motorcycles or whatever in their garages when they were kids.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The robotics students, grad students, and just roboticists that I know and I hang out with, there's a endless energy and they're just happy. Say, I compare another group of people that are alike that are people that skydive professionally. There's just excitement and general energy that I think probably has to do with the fact that they're just constantly, first of all, fail a lot. And then the joy of building a thing that you eventually works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Talking about being happy, there used to be a time when I was doing the machine shop work myself back in those JPL and Caltech days, when, if I came home smelling like the machine shop because it's an oily place, my wife would say, \"You had a good day today.\" Because she could tell that that's where I'd been.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've actually built something. You've done something in the physical world. And probably the videos help show off what robotics is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>At Boston Dynamics, it put us on the map. I remember interviewing some sales guy and he was from a company and he said, \"Well, no one's ever heard of my company but we have really good products. You guys, everybody knows who you are but you don't have any products at all.\" Which was true, and we thank YouTube for that. YouTube came, we caught the YouTube wave and it had a huge impact on our company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, it's a big impact not just on your company, but on robotics in general and helping people understand and inspire what is possible with robots, and inspire imagination, fear and everything. The full spectrum of human emotion was aroused, which is great for the entirety of humanity, and also, it's probably inspiring for young people that want to get into AI and robotics. Let me ask you about some competitors. You've been a complimentary of Elon and Tesla's work on Optimus robot with their humanoid robot. What do you think of their efforts there with the humanoid robot?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>where Atlas is, for instance. I don't know, it's a little hard to compare them to the other companies. I visited Figure. I think they're doing well and they have a good team. I've visited Apptronik and I think they have a good team and they're doing well. But Elon has a lot of resources, he has a lot of ambition. I like to take some credit for his ambition. I think if I read between the lines, it's hard not to think that him seeing what Atlas is doing is a little bit of an inspiration. I hope so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think Atlas and Optimus will hang out at some point?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of different robots. We bought everything we could buy. So we have Spots. I think we have a good size fleet of them. I don't know how many it is, but a good size fleet. We have a couple of ANYmal robots. ANYmal is a company founded by Marco Hutter, even though he's not that involved anymore, but we have a couple of those. We have a bunch of arms like Franka's and USRobotics. Because even though we have ambitions to build stuff and we are starting to build stuff, day one, getting off the ground, we just bought stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love this robot playground you've built.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's some areas that feel like a playground, but it's not like they're all frolic together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, maybe you'll arrange a robot meetup. But in general, what's your view on competition in this space for especially humanoid and legged robots? Are you excited by the competition or the friendly competition?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we didn't compete. We provided the robots. In the AI world now, now that we're working on cognitive stuff, it feels much more a competition. The entry requirements in terms of computing hardware and the skills of the team and hiring talent, it's a much tougher place. So I think much more about competition now on the cognitive side. On the physical side, it doesn't feel it's that much about competition yet. Obviously, with 10 humanoid companies out there, 10 or 12, I mean there's probably others that I don't know about, they're definitely in competition, will be in competition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much room is there for a quadruped and especially a humanoid robot to become cheaper?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>competition, I wanted to say one thing. I think in the quadruped space, having other people selling quadruped's is a great thing for Boston Dynamics because I believe the question in the user's minds is, \"Which quadruped do I want?\" It's not, \"Do I want a quadruped?\" \"Can a quadruped do my job?\" It's much more like that, which is a great place for it to be. Then you're just doing the things you normally do to make your product better and compete, selling and all that stuff. And that'll be the way it is with humanoids at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of humanoids and you're just not even...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're creating the category or the category is happening. I mean right now, the use cases, that's the key thing. Having realistic use cases that are moneymaking in robotics is a big challenge. There's the warehouse use case. That's probably the only thing that makes anybody any money in robotics at this point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's got to be a moment-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's old-fashioned robots. I mean, there's fixed arms doing manufacturing. I don't want to say that they're not making money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... Industrial robotics, yes. But there's got to be a moment when social robotics starts making real money. Meaning a Spot type robot in the home and there's tens of millions of them in the home and they're, I don't know, how many dogs there are in the United States as pets.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Many.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It feels there's something we love about having a intelligent companion with us that remembers us, that's excited to see us. All that stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it's also true that the companies making those things, there've been a lot of failures in recent times. There's that one year when I think three of them went under. So it's not that easy to do that. Getting performance, safety and cost all to be where they need to be at the same time, that's hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also some of it is, like you say, you can have a product but people might not be aware of it. So also part of it is the videos or however you connect with the public, the culture and create the category. Make people realize this is the thing you want. There's a lot of negative perceptions you can have. Do you really want a system with the camera in your home walking around? If it's presented correctly and if there's the right boundaries around it and you understand how it works and so on, a lot of people would want to. And if they don't, they might be suspicious of it. So that's an important one. We all use smartphones and that has a camera that's looking at us.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It has two or three or four.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's listening. Very few people are suspicious about it. They take it for granted and so on. And I think robots would be the same way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as you work on the cognitive aspect of these robots, do you think we'll ever get to human level or superhuman level intelligence?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that intelligence is a lot of different things and I think some things, computers are already smarter than people, and some things they're not even close. And I think you'd need a menu of detailed categories to come up with that. But I also think that the conversation that seems to be happening about AGI's puzzles me. So I ask you a question, do you think there's anybody smarter than you in the world?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Absolutely, yes.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I don't understand, even if computers were smarter than people, why we should assume that that's a threat, especially since they could easily be smarter but still available to us or under our control, which is basically how computers generally are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the fear is that they would be 10x or 100x smarter and operating under different morals and ethical codes than humans naturally do, and so almost become misaligned in unintended ways and therefore harm humans in ways we just can't predict. And even if we program them to do a thing, on the way of doing that thing, they would cause a lot of harm. And when they're 100 times, 1,000 times, 10,000 times smarter than us, we won't be able to stop it or we won't be able to even see the harm as it's happening until it's too late. That stuff.

Despite that, I think they're a boon to humankind, they're very useful, many of us love them and those technical problems can be solved. I think they're becoming safer.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It took me a while to realize that I was a contrarian, but it can be a useful tool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you had people tell you on the robotics side that, \"I don't think you could do this\"? A negative motivation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'd rather talk about, when we were doing a lot of DARPA work, there was a Marine, Ed Tovar, who's still around. What he would always say is when someone would say, \"You can't do that.\" He'd say, \"Why not?\" And it's a great question. I ask all the time when I'm thinking, \"We're not going to do that nice thing.\" \"Why not?\" And I give him credit for opening my eyes to resisting that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the Hawaiian shirt is almost a symbol of \"why not?\" Okay. What advice would you give to young folks that are trying to figure out what they want to do with their life? How to have a life they can be proud of? How they can have a career they can be proud of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they should do. And I think the advice I used to give was something like, \"Well, if you had no constraints on you, no resource constraints, no opportunity constraints and no skill constraints, what could you imagine doing?\" And I said, \"Well, start there and see how close you can get to what's realistic for how close you can get.\" The other version of that is try and figure out what you want to do and do that. A lot of people think that they're in a channel and there's only limited opportunities, but it's usually wider than they think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The opportunities really are limitless. But at the same time, you want to pick a thing and it's the diligence and really, really pursue it. And really pursue it. Because sometimes the really special stuff happens after years of pursuit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Oh, absolutely. It can take a while.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, you've been doing this for 40 plus years.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Some people think I'm in a rut. And in fact, some of the inspiration for the AI Institute is to say, \"I've been working on locomotion for however many years it was, let's do something else.\" And it's a really fascinating and interesting challenge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're hoping to show it off also in the same way it has been done with Boston Dynamics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just about to start showing some stuff off. I hope we have a YouTube channel. I mean one of the challenges is, it's one thing to show athletic skills on YouTube. Showing cognitive function is a lot harder, and I haven't quite figured out yet how that's going to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There might be a way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Why not?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I also do think sucking at a task is also compelling. The incremental improvement. A robot being really terrible at a task and then slowly becoming better. Even in athletic intelligence, honestly. Learning to walk and falling and slowly figuring that out, I think there's something extremely compelling about that. We like flaws, especially with the cognitive task. It's okay to be clumsy. It's okay to be confused and a little silly and all that stuff. It feels like in that space is where we can-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's charm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... There's charm and there's something inspiring about a robot sucking and then becoming less terrible slowly at a task.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I think you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That reveals something about ourselves. Ultimately, that's what's one of the coolest things about robots, is it's a mirror about what makes humans special. Just by watching how hard it is to make a robot do the things that humans do. You realize how special we are. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? Marc, do you ever ask about the big questions as you try to create these humanoid, human-like intelligence systems?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know. I think you have to have fun while you're here. That's about all I know. It would be a waste not to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The ride is pretty short, so might as well have fun. Marc, I'm a huge fan of yours. It's a huge honor that you would talk with me. This is really amazing and your work for many decades has been amazing and I can't wait to see what you do at the AI Institute. I'm going to be waiting impatiently for the videos and the demos and the next robot meetup for maybe Atlas and Optimus to hang out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would love to do that. That would be fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you so much for talking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you. It was fun talking to you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Marc Raibert. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clark. \"Whether we're based on carbon or on silken makes no fundamental difference. We should each be treated with appropriate respect.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
