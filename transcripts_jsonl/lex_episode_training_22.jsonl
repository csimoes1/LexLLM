{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew MacDougall, Bliss Chapman, and Noland Arbaugh about Neuralink and the future of humanity. Elon, DJ, Matthew and Bliss are of course part of the amazing Neuralink team, and Noland is the first human to have a Neuralink device implanted in his brain. I speak with each of them individually, so use timestamps to jump around, or as I recommend, go hardcore, and listen to the whole thing. This is the longest podcast I've ever done. It's a fascinating, super technical, and wide-ranging conversation, and I loved every minute of it. And now, dear friends, here's Elon Musk, his fifth time on this, the Lex Fridman podcast,<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what is Nitro? It's just got a lot of caffeine or something?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Don't ask questions. It's called Nitro. Do you need to know anything else?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's got nitrogen in it. That's ridiculous. What we breathe is 78% nitrogen anyway. What do you need to add more for? Unfortunately, you're going to eat it. Most people think that they're breathing oxygen and they're actually breathing 78% nitrogen. You need like a milk bar, like from Clockwork Orange.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Is that the top three Kubrick film for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Clockwork Orange? It's pretty good. It's demented. Jarring, I'd say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Okay. So, first, let's step back, and big congrats on getting Neuralink implanted into a human. That's a historic step for Neuralink.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's many more to come.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And we just obviously have our second implant as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How did that go?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So far, so good. It looks like we've got, I think, on the order of 400 electrodes that are providing signals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How quickly do you think the number of human participants will scale?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It depends somewhat on the regulatory approval, the rate at which we get regulatory approvals. So, we're hoping to do 10 by the end of this year, total of 10. So, eight more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And with each one, you're going to be learning a lot of lessons about the neurobiology of the brain, everything. The whole chain of the Neuralink, the decoding, the signal processing, all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. I think it's obviously going to get better with each one. I don't want to jinx it, but it seems to have gone extremely well with the second implant. So, there's a lot of signal, a lot of electrodes. It's working very well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What improvements do you think we'll see in Neuralink in the coming, let's say, let's get crazy, the coming years.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the number of electrodes dramatically. We'll improve the signal processing. So, even with only roughly, I don't know, 10, 15% of the electrodes working with Noland, with our first patient, we were able to get to achieve a bit per second. That's twice the world record. So, I think we'll start vastly exceeding the world record by orders of magnitude in the years to come. So, start getting to, I don't know, 100 bits per second, thousand. Maybe if five years from now, we might be at a megabit, faster than any human could possibly communicate by typing, or speaking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. That BPS is an interesting metric to measure. There might be a big leap in the experience once you reach a certain level of BPS.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like entire new ways of interacting with a computer might be unlocked.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And with humans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>With other humans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Provided they have want a Neuralink, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Otherwise they wont be able to absorb the signals fast enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think they'll improve the quality of intellectual discourse?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think you could think of it, if you were to slow down communication, how do you feel about that? If you'd only talk at, let's say one-tenth of normal speed, you'd be like, \"Wow, that's agonizingly slow.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, now imagine you could communicate clearly at 10, or 100, or 1,000 times faster than normal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Listen, I'm pretty sure nobody in their right mind listens to me at 1X. they listen at 2X. I can only imagine what 10X would feel like, or I could actually understand it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I usually default to 1.5X. You can do 2X. Well actually, if I'm listening to somebody get to... in 15, 20 minutes, I want to go to sleep, then I'll do it 1.5X. If I'm paying attention, I'll do 2X.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But actually, if you actually listen to podcasts, or audiobooks or anything at... If you get used to doing it at 1.5, then one sounds painfully slow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm still holding onto one, because I'm afraid, I'm afraid of myself becoming bored with the reality, with the real world, where everyone's speaking in 1X.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it depends on the person. You can speak very fast. Like we can communicate very quickly. And also, if you use a wide range of... if your vocabulary is larger, your effective bit rate is higher.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good way to put it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The effective bit rate. That is the question, is how much information is actually compressed in the low bit transfer of language?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. If there's a single word that is able to convey something that would normally require, I don't know, 10 simple words, then you've got maybe a 10X compression on your hands. And that's really like with memes. Memes are like data compression. You're simultaneously hit with a wide range of symbols that you can interpret, and you get it faster than if it were words, or a simple picture.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, you're referring to memes broadly like ideas.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's an entire idea structure that is like an idea template, and then you can add something to that idea template. But somebody has that pre-existing idea template in their head. So, when you add that incremental bit of information, you're conveying much more than if you just said a few words. It's everything associated with that meme.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think there'll be emergent leaps of capability as you scale the number of electrodes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there'll be an actual number where just the human experience will be altered?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think that number might be? Whether electrodes, or BPS? We of course, don't know for sure, but is this 10,000, 100,000?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>your bits per second is less than one, averaged over 24 hours. It's quite slow. And now, even if you're communicating very quickly, and you're talking to somebody who understands what you're saying, because in order to communicate, you have to at least to some degree, model the mind state of the person to whom you're speaking. Then take the concept you're trying to convey, compress that into a small number of syllables, speak them, and hope that the other person decompresses them into a conceptual structure that is as close to what you have in your mind as possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a lot of signal loss there in that process.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know, several megabytes minimum, a bunch of fluff. But nonetheless, we still prefer to have the computer with the more memory and more compute. So, the long-term aspiration of Neuralink is to improve the AI human symbiosis by increasing the bandwidth of the communication. Because even if... In the most benign scenario of AI, you have to consider that the AI is simply going to get bored waiting for you to spit out a few words. If the AI can communicate at terabits per second, and you're communicating at bits per second, it's like talking to a tree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it is a very interesting question for a super intelligent species, what use are humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think there is some argument for humans as a source of will.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Will?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>planning part of the brain. Now, the cortex is much smarter than the limbic system, and yet is largely in service to the limbic system. It's trying to make the limbic system happy. The sheer amount of compute that's gone into people trying to get laid is insane, without actually seeking procreation. They're just literally trying to do this simple motion, and they get a kick out of it. So, this simple, which in the abstract, rather absurd motion, which is sex, the cortex is putting a massive amount of compute into trying to figure out how to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So like 90% of distributed compute of the human species is spent on trying to get laid, probably. A large percentage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>system happy, because the limbic system wants to have sex, or wants some tasty food, or whatever the case may be. And then that is then further augmented by the tertiary system, which is your phone, your laptop, iPad, whatever, all your computing stuff. That's your tertiary layer. So, you're actually already a cyborg. You have this tertiary compute layer, which is in the form of your computer with all the applications, or your compute devices. And so, in the getting laid front, there's actually a massive amount of digital compute also trying to get laid, with Tinder and whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, the compute that we humans have built is also participating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's like gigawatts of compute going into getting laid, of digital compute.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What if AGI was-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is happening as we speak.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... if we merge with AI, it's just going to expand the compute that we humans use-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pretty much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... to try to get laid.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it's one of the things. Certainly, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But what I'm saying is that, yes, is there a use for humans? Well, there's this fundamental question of what's the meaning of life? Why do anything at all? And so, if our simple limbic system provides a source of will to do something, that then goes through our cortex, that then goes to our tertiary compute layer, then I don't know, it might actually be that the AI, in a benign scenario, is simply trying to make the human limbic system happy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It seems like the will is not just about the limbic system. There's a lot of interesting, complicated things in there. We also want power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's limbic too, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then we also want to, in a kind of cooperative way, alleviate the suffering in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not everybody does. But yeah, sure, some people do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As a group of humans, when we get together, we start to have this kind of collective intelligence that is more complex in its will than the underlying individual descendants of apes, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's other motivations, and that could be a really interesting source of an objective function for AGI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There are these fairly cerebral, or higher level goals. For me, it's like, what's the meaning of life, or understanding the nature of the universe, is of great interest to me, and hopefully to the AI. And that's the mission of xAI and Grok is understand the universe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So do you think people... When you have a Neuralink with 10,000, 100,000 channels, most of the use cases will be communication with AI systems?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people who are completely blind, lost both eyes, or optic nerve, or just can't see at all, to be able to see by directly triggering the neurons in the visual cortex. So we're just starting at the basics here, so it's the simple stuff, relatively speaking, is solving neuron damage. It can also solve I think probably schizophrenia, if people have seizures of some kind, it could probably solve that. It could help with memory. So, there's kind of a tech tree, if you will. You've got the basics. You need literacy before you can have Lord of the Rings.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Got it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, do you have letters and the alphabet? Okay, great. Words? And then eventually you get sagas. So, I think there may be some things to worry about in the future, but the first several years are really just solving basic neurological damage, like for people who have essentially complete or near complete loss from the brain to the body, like Stephen Hawking would be an example, the Neuralink would be incredibly profound, because you can imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate as fast as we're communicating, perhaps faster. And that's certainly possible. Probable, in fact. Likely, I'd say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a kind of dual track of medical and non-medical, meaning so everything you've talked about could be applied to people who are non-disabled in the future?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The logical thing to do is... Sensible thing to do is to start off solving basic neuron damage issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because there's obviously some risk with a new device. You can't get the risk down to zero, it's not possible. So, you want to have the highest possible reward, given there's a certain irreducible risk. And if somebody's able to have a profound improvement in their communication, that's worth the risk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As you get the risk down.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of people that have been using it for years and the risk is minimal, then perhaps at that point you could consider saying, \"Okay, let's aim for augmentation.\" Now, I think we're actually going to aim for augmentation with people who have neuron damage. So we're not just aiming to give people the communication data rate equivalent to normal humans. We're aiming to give people who have... A quadriplegic, or maybe have complete loss of the connection to the brain and body, a communication data rate that exceeds normal humans. While we're in there, why not? Let's give people superpowers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the same for vision. As you restore vision, there could be aspects of that restoration that are superhuman.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>got, say 10,000 neurons, it's not just 10,000 pixels, because you can adjust the field between the neurons, and do them in patterns in order to have say, 10,000 electrodes, effectively give you, I don't know, maybe like having a megapixel, or a 10 megapixel situation. And then over time, I think you get to higher resolution than human eyes. And you could also see in different wavelengths. So, like Geordi La Forge from Star Trek, he had the thing. Do you want to see it in radar? No problem. You could see ultraviolet, infrared, eagle vision, whatever you want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there'll be... let me ask a Joe Rogan question.

The more you are a tree, the less you know what the tree is.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We could better align collective human will with AI if the output rate especially was dramatically increased.

So, it's better than the current situation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that output rate would be by increasing the number of electrodes, number of channels, and also maybe implanting multiple Neuralinks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there'll be a world in the next couple of decades where it's hundreds of millions of people have Neuralinks?<|eot_id|>"}

It would supersede the cell phone, for example. I mean, the biggest problem that say, a phone has, is trying to figure out what you want. That's why you've got auto complete, and you've got output, which is all the pixels on the screen, but from the perspective of the human, the output is so frigging slow. Desktop or phone is desperately just trying to understand what you want. And there's an eternity between every keystroke from a computer standpoint.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what does it take to win?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>half the horsepower of your competitors, the best driver will still lose. If it's twice the horsepower, then probably even a mediocre driver will still win. So, the training compute is kind of like the engine, this horsepower of the engine. So, really, you want to try to do the best on that. And then, it's how efficiently do you use that training compute, and how efficiently do you do the inference, the use of the AI? So, obviously, that comes down to human talent. And then, what unique access to data do you have? That also plays a role.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think Twitter data will be useful?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have. So, on a go forward basis, what's useful is the fact that it's up to the second, because that's hard for them to scrape in real time. So, there's an immediacy advantage that Grok has already. I think with Tesla and the real time video coming from several million cars, ultimately tens of millions of cars with Optimus, there might be hundreds of millions of Optimus robots, maybe billions, learning a tremendous amount from the real world. That's the biggest source of data, I think, ultimately, is Optimus, probably. Optimus is going to be the biggest source of data.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because it's able to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because reality scales. Reality scales to the scale of reality. It's actually humbling to see how little data humans have actually been able to accumulate. Really, if you say how many trillions of usable tokens have humans generated, where on a non-duplicative... Discounting spam and repetitive stuff, it's not a huge number. You run out pretty quickly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And Optimus can go...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Optimus robot can go anywhere. And there's more reality off the road. And go off-road.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, the Optimus robot can pick up the cup and see, did it pick up the cup in the right way? Did it, say, go pour water in the cup? Did the water go in the cup or not go in the cups? Did it spill water or not? Simple stuff like that. But it can do that at scale times a billion, so generate useful data from reality, so cause and effect stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think it takes to get to mass production of humanoid robots like that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>global capacity for vehicles is about 100 million a year, and it could be higher. It's just that the demand is on the order of 100 million a year. And then, there's roughly two billion vehicles that are in use in some way, which makes sense because the life of a vehicle is about 20 years. So, at steady state, you can have 100 million vehicles produced a year with a two billion vehicle fleet, roughly. Now, for humanoid robots, the utility is much greater. So, my guess is humanoid robots are more like at a billion plus per year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But until you came along and started building Optimus, it was thought to be an extremely difficult problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, it still is an extremely difficult problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. So, a walk in the park. I mean, Optimus, currently, would struggle to walk in the park. I mean, it can walk in a park.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. It can already do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But all kinds of objects.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All foreign objects. I mean, pouring water in a cup is not trivial, because then if you don't know anything about the container, it could be all kinds of containers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's going to be an immense amount of engineering just going into the hand. The hand, it might be close to half of all the engineering in Optimus. From an electromechanical standpoint, the hand is probably roughly half of the engineering.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But so much of the intelligence of humans goes into what we do with our hands.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the manipulation of the world, manipulation of objects in the world. Intelligent, safe manipulation of objects in the world. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, you start really thinking about your hand and how it works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I do all the time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hands. So I mean, your hands, the actuators, the muscles of your hand are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm. So, your forearm has the muscles that actually control your hand. There's a few small muscles in the hand itself, but your hand is really like a skeleton meat puppet and with cables. So, the muscles that control your fingers are in your forearm, and they go through the carpal tunnel, which is that you've got a little collection of bones and a tiny tunnel that these cables, the tendons go through, and those tendons are mostly what move your hands.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And something like those tendons has to be re-engineered into the Optimus in order to do all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So the current Optimus, we tried putting the actuators in the hand itself. Then you sort of end up having these-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Giant hands?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... yeah, giant hands that look weird. And then, they don't actually have enough degrees of freedom or enough strength. So then you realize, \"Oh, okay, that's why you got to put the actuators in the forearm.\" And just like a human, you've got to run cables through a narrow tunnel to operate the fingers. And then, there's also a reason for not having all the fingers the same length. So, it wouldn't be expensive from an energy or evolutionary standpoint to have all your fingers be the same length. So, why not do the same length?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, why not?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because it's actually better to have different lengths. Your dexterity is better if you've got fingers that are different lengths. There are more things you can do and your dexterity is actually better if your fingers are a different length. There's a reason we've got a little finger. Why not have a little finger that's bigger?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because it helps you with fine motor skills.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This little finger helps?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It does. But if you lost your little finger, you'd have noticeably less dexterity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, as you're figuring out this problem, you have to also figure out a way to do it so you can mass manufacture it, so as to be as simple as possible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>11 and has, like I said, the actuators in the forearm. And all the actuators are designed from scratch, from physics first principles. The sensors are all designed from scratch. And we'll continue to put a tremendous amount of engineering effort into improving the hand. By hand, I mean the entire forearm, from elbow forward, is really the hand. So, that's incredibly difficult engineering, actually. And so, the simplest possible version of a humanoid robot that can do even most, perhaps not all, of what a human can do is actually still very complicated. It's not simple. It's very difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you just speak to what it takes for a great engineering team for you? What I saw in Memphis, the supercomputer cluster, is just this intense drive towards simplifying the process, understanding the process, constantly improving it, constantly iterating it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as though they've succeeded if they've not been forced to put things back in. But, actually, they haven't because they've been overly conservative and have left things in there that shouldn't be. And only the third thing is try to optimize it or simplify it. Again, these all sound, I think, very obvious when I say them, but the number of times I've made these mistakes is more than I care to remember. That's why I have this mantra. So in fact, I'd say the most common mistake of smart engineers is to optimize a thing that should not exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. So, like you say, you run through the algorithm and basically show up to a problem, show up to the supercomputer cluster, and see the process, and ask, \"Can this be deleted?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. First try to delete it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. That's not easy to do.<|eot_id|>"}

And so, they overcorrect, and then they put too much stuff in there and overcomplicate things. So, you actually have to say, \"Look, we're deliberately going to delete more than we should.\" At least one in 10 things, we're going to add back in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've seen you suggest just that, that something should be deleted, and you can kind of see the pain.<|eot_id|>"}

So, you got to overcorrect.

And then, the fifth thing is to automate it. I've gone backwards so many times where I've automated something, sped it up, simplified it, and then deleted it. And I got tired of doing that.

So if you can sort of detach yourself somewhat emotionally, which is not easy, and say, okay look, this is not actually from someone that knows me or, they're literally just writing to get impressions and clicks.

Thanks for talking about it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk. And now, dear friends, here's DJ Seo, the Co-Founder, President and COO of Neuralink. When did you first become fascinated by the human brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not until graduate school. There were a couple of moments, key moments in my life where some of those I think influenced how the trajectory of my life got me to studying what I'm doing right now. One was growing up, both sides of my family, my grandparents had a very severe form of Alzheimer and it's incredibly debilitating conditions. I mean, literally you're seeing someone's whole identity and their mind just losing over time. And I just remember thinking how both the power of the mind, but also how something like that could really lose your sense of identity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's fascinating that that is one of the ways to reveal the power of a thing by watching it lose the power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, a lot of what we know about the brain actually comes from these cases where there are trauma to the brain or some parts of the brain that led someone to lose certain abilities. And as a result there's some correlation and understanding of that part of the tissue being critical for that function. And it's an incredibly fragile organ, if you think about it that way. But also it's incredibly plastic and incredibly resilient in many different ways.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And by the way, the term plastic as we'll use a bunch, means that it's adaptable. So neuroplasticity refers to the adaptability of the human brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to close that wound. And there were hypotheses that when you apply external electric field, you can actually accelerate the closing of that field by having basically electro taxing of the cells around that wound site. And specifically not just for a normal wound, there are chronic wounds that don't heal. So we were interested in building some sort of a wearable patch that you could apply to facilitate that healing process. And that was in collaboration with Professor Michel Maharbiz, which was a great addition to my thesis committee and it really shaped the rest of my PhD career.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this would be the first time you interacted with biology, I suppose?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back that wavefront with some sort of modulation that's unique to your ID. That's what's called backscattering fundamentally. So the tag itself actually doesn't have to consume that much energy. That was the mechanism through which we were thinking about sending the data back. When you have an external ultrasonic transducer that's sending ultrasonic wave to your implant, the neural dust implant, and it records some information about its environment, whether it's a neuron firing or some other state of the tissue that it's interfacing with. And then it just amplitude modulates the wavefront that comes back to the source.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the recording step would be the only one that requires any energy. So what would require energy in that low step?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct. So it is that initial startup circuitry to get that recording, amplifying it, and then just modulating. And the mechanism to which that you can enable that is there is this specialized crystal called piezoelectric crystals that are able to convert sound energy into electrical energy and vice versa. So you can kind of have this interplay between the ultrasonic domain and electrical domain that is the biological tissue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So on the theme of parking very small computational devices next to neurons, that's the dream, the vision of brain computer interfaces. Maybe before we talk about Neuralink, can you give a sense of the history of the field of BCI? What has been maybe the continued dream and also some of the milestones along the way of the different approaches and the amazing work done at the various labs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think a good starting point is going back to 1790s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I did not expect that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>talking about flow of ions and how that really leads to how neurons communicate. And they won the Nobel Prize for that 10 years later in the 1960s. So in 1969, Eb Fetz from University of Washington published this beautiful paper called Operant Conditioning of Cortical Unit Activity, where he was able to record a single unit neuron from a monkey and was able to have the monkey modulated based on its activity and reward system. So I would say this is the very, very first example, as far as I'm aware, of close loop brain computer interface or BCI.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The abstract reads, \"The activity of single neurons in precentral cortex of unanesthetized monkeys was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with delivery of a food pellet. Auditory or visual feedback of unit firing rates was usually provided in addition to food reinforcement.\" Cool. So they actually got it done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They got it done. This is back in 1969.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\" After several training sessions, monkeys could increase the activity of newly isolated cells by 50 to 500% above rates before reinforcement.\" Fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Brain is very [inaudible 01:46:45].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so from here, the number of experiments grew.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them to fire. So what that means is, there are a set of neurons that would increase their spiking activities when you're thinking about moving to the left, right, up, down, and any of those vectors. And based on that, you could start to think, well, if you can't identify those essential eigenvectors, you can do a lot. And you can actually use that information for actually decoding someone's intended movement from the cortex. So that was a very, very seminal paper that showed that there is some sort of code that you can extract, especially in the motor cortex.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's signal there. And if you measure the electrical signal from the brain that you could actually figure out what the intention was.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct. Yeah, not only electrical signals, but electrical signals from the right set of neurons that give you these preferential direction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So going slowly towards Neuralink, one interesting question is, what do we understand on the BCI front, on invasive versus non-invasive, from this line of work? How important is it to park next to the neuron? What does that get you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what the next goal is. So what you have to do is you have to drop the microphone into the stadium and then get near the source into the individual chatter. In this specific example, you would want to have it right next to where the huddle is happening. So I think that's kind of a good illustration of what we're trying to do when we say invasive or minimally invasive or implanted brain computer interfaces versus non-invasive or non-implanted brain interfaces. It's basically talking about where do you put that microphone and what can you do with that information.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the biophysics of the read and write communication that we're talking about here as we now step into the efforts at Neuralink?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>many ways, if you think about what they are, they're doing the job of a modern day transistors. Transistors are nothing more, at the end of the day, than a voltage-gated conduction channel. And nature found a way to have that very, very early on in its evolution. And as we all know, with the transistor, you can have many, many computation and a lot of amazing things that we have access to today. So I think it's one of those, just as a tangent, just a beautiful, beautiful invention that the nature came up with, these voltage-gated ion channels.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I suppose there's, on the biological of it, every level of the complexity, of the hierarchy, of the organism, there's going to be some mechanisms for storing information and for doing computation. And this is just one such way. But to do that with biological and chemical components is interesting. Plus, when neurons, it's not just electricity, it's chemical communication, it's also mechanical. These are actual objects that vibrate, they move. It's all of that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>ways to cause neurons to actually fire an action potential using ultrasound wave. And the mechanism to which that's happening is still unclear, as I understand. It may just be that you're imparting some sort of thermal energy and that causes cells to depolarize in some interesting ways. But there are also these ion channels, or even membranes, that actually just open up as pore as they're being mechanically shook, vibrated. There's just a lot of elements of these, move particles, which again, that's governed by diffusion physics, movements of particles. And there's also a lot of interesting physics there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also, not to mention, as Roger Penrose talks about, there might be some beautiful weirdness in the quantum mechanical effects of all of this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he actually believes that consciousness might emerge from the quantum mechanical effects there. So there's physics, there's chemistry, there's biology, all of that is going on there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to be able to record that particular local membrane potential change in that neuron. And just to give you a sense of scale also, when you look at a hundred micron voxel, so a hundred micron by a hundred micron by a hundred micron box in a brain tissue, there's roughly around 40 neurons, and whatever number of connections that they have. So there's a lot in that volume of tissue. So the moment you're outside of that, there's just no hope that you'll be able to detect that change from that one specific neuron that you may care about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But as you're moving about this space, you'll be hearing other ones. So if you move another a hundred micron, you'll be hearing chatter from another community.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so the whole sense is, you want to place as many as possible electrodes, and then you're listening to the chatter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>when you're further away from the source. It is just a charged medium. So similar to how when you have electromagnetic waves propagating in atmosphere or in a charged medium like a plasma, there's this weird shielding that happens that actually further attenuates the signal as you move away from it. So yeah, you see, if you do a really, really deep dive on the signal attenuation over distance, you start to see one over R square in the beginning and then exponential drop off, and that's the knee at which you go from electromagnetism dominating to diffusion physic dominating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But once again, with the electrodes, the biophysics that you need to understand is not as deep because no matter where you're placing it, you're listening to a small crowd of local neurons.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct, yeah. So once you penetrate the brain, you're in the arena, so to speak.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a lot of neurons.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There are many, many of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then again, there's a whole field of neuroscience that's studying how the different groupings, the different sections of the seating in the arena, what they usually are responsible for, which is where the metaphor probably falls apart because the seating is not that organized in an arena.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Also, most of them are silent. They don't really do much. Or their activities are... You have to hit it with just the right set of stimulus.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they're usually quiet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're usually very quiet. Similar to dark energy and dark matter, there's dark neurons. What are they all doing? When you place these electrodes, again, within this hundred micron volume, you have 40 or so neurons. Why do you not see 40 neurons? Why do you see only a handful? What is happening there?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, they're mostly quiet, but when they speak, they say profound shit. That's the way I'd like to think about it. Anyway, before we zoom in even more, let's zoom out. So how does Neuralink work from the surgery to the implant, to the signal and the decoding process, and the human being able to use the implant to actually affect the world outside? And all of this, I'm asking in the context of, there's a gigantic historic milestone that Neuralink just accomplished in January of this year. Putting a Neuralink implant in the first human being, Noland. And there's been a lot to talk about there about his experience because he's able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating complexity of that experience of everything involved. But on the technical level, how does Neuralink work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are smaller than human hair. And once everything is surgerized, you have these neural signals, these spiking neurons, that are coming out of the brain, and you need to have some sort of software to decode what the users intend to do with that. So there's what's called the Neuralink Application or B1 App that's doing that translation. It's running the very, very simple machine learning model that decodes these inputs that are neural signals and then convert it to a set of outputs that allows our first participant, Noland, to be able to control a cursor on the screen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And this is done wirelessly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>threads, each thread having 16 electrodes along the span of three to four millimeters, separated by 200 microns. So you can actually record along the depth of the insertion. And based on that signal, there's custom integrated circuit or ASIC that we built that amplifies the neural signals that you're recording and then digitizing it and then has some mechanism for detecting whether there was an interesting event that is a spiking event, and decide to send that or not send that through Bluetooth to an external device, whether it's a phone or a computer that's running this Neuralink application.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's onboard signal processing already just to decide whether this is an interesting event or not. So there is some computational power on board in addition to the human brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>off only the interesting data that you need, which in this particular case for motor decoding is, occurrence of a spike or not. And then being able to use that to decode the intended cursor movement. So the implant itself processes it, figures out whether a spike happened or not with our spike detection algorithm, and then sends it off, packages it, sends it off through Bluetooth to an external device that then has the model to decode, okay, based on these spiking inputs, did Noland wish to go up, down, left, right, or click or right click or whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of this is really fascinating, but let's stick on the N1 Implant itself. So the thing that's in the brain. So I'm looking at a picture of it, there's an enclosure, there's a charging coil, so we didn't talk about the charging, which is fascinating. The battery, the power electronics, the antenna. Then there's the signal processing electronics. I wonder if there's more kinds of signal processing you can do? That's another question. And then there's the threads themselves with the enclosure on the bottom. So maybe to ask about the charging. So there's an external charging device?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a US quarter. It's about nine millimeters thick. So basically this implant, once you have the craniectomy and the directomy, threads are inserted, and the hole that you created, this craniectomy, gets replaced with that. So basically that thing plugs that hole, and you can screw in these self-drilling cranial screws to hold it in place. And at the end of the day, once you have the skin flap over, there's only about two to three millimeters that's obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant to where the screws are. And that's the minor bump that you have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those threads look tiny. That's incredible. That is really incredible. That is really incredible. And also, you're right, most of the actual volume is the battery. This is way smaller than I realized.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the thread themselves also has a very interesting feature at the end of it called the loop.

So what's the width of a thread?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So the width of a thread starts from 16 micron and then tapers out to about 84 micron.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this implant without causing that temperature threshold to reach. And even small things like, you see this charging coil and what's called a ferrite shield. So without that ferrite shield, what you end up having when you have resonant inductive charging is that the battery itself is a metallic can, and you form these eddy currents from external charger and that causes heating, and that actually contributes to inefficiency in charging. So this ferrite shield, what it does, is that it actually concentrate that field line away from the battery and then around the coil that's actually wrapped around it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of really fascinating design here to make it, I mean, you're integrating a computer into a biological, a complex biological system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a lot of innovation here. I would say that part of what enabled this was just the innovations in the wearable. There's a lot of really, really powerful tiny, low-power microcontrollers, temperature sensors, or various different sensors and power electronics. A lot of innovation really came in the charging coil design, how this is packaged, and how do you enable charging such that you don't really exceed that temperature limit, which is not a constraint for other devices out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's talk about the threads themselves.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, that's also one element that was incredibly important for us. So each of these threads are now, as I mentioned, 16 micron in width, and then they taper to 84 micron, but in thickness they're less than five micron. And in thickness it's mostly a polyimide at the bottom and this metal track and then another polyimide. So two micron of polyimide, 400 nanometer of this metal stack and two micron of polyimide sandwiched together to protect it from the environment that is 37 degrees C bag of salt water.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe can you speak to some interesting aspects of the material design here? What does it take to design a thing like this and to be able to manufacture a thing like this? For people who don't know anything about this kind of thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>looking at similar material stack. There's kind of a fundamental question, and still needs to be answered, around the longevity and reliability of these microelectrodes that we call, compared to some of the other more conventional neural interfaces devices that are intracranial, so penetrating the cortex, that are more rigid, like the Utah Array. That are these four by four millimeter kind of silicon shank that have exposed recording site at the end of it. And that's been kind of the innovation from Richard Normann back in 1997. It's called the Utah Array because he was at University of Utah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And what does the Utah Array look like? So it's a rigid type of [inaudible 02:14:41]?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so we can actually look it up. Yeah, so it's a bed of needle. There's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Those are rigid shanks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Rigid, yeah, you weren't kidding.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you can have it inserted at different depths, but that's one of the other big differences. And then, the main key difference is the fact that there's no active electronics. These are just electrodes, and then there's a bundle of a wire that you're seeing, and then that actually then exits the craniotomy that then has this port that you can connect to for any external electronic devices. They are working on, or have, the wireless telemetry device but it still requires a through-the-skin port, that actually is one of the biggest failure modes for infection for the system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some of the challenges associated with flexible threads? Like for example, on the robotic side, R1, implanting those threads. How difficult is that task?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that is ultimately we want this to help millions and millions of people that can benefit from this. And there just aren't that many neurosurgeons out there. And robots can be something that we hope can actually do large parts of the surgery. But the robot is this entire other sort of category of product that we're working on. And it's essentially this multi- axis gantry system that has the specialized robot head that has all of the optics and this kind of a needle-retracting mechanism that maneuvers these threads via this loop structure that you have on the thread.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the thread already has a loop structure by which you can grab it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is fascinating. So you mentioned optics. So there's a robot, R1, so for now, there's a human that actually creates a hole in the skull. And then after that, there's a computer vision component that's finding a way to avoid the blood vessels. And then you're grabbing it by the loop, each individual thread, and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessels and also choosing the depth of placement, all that. So controlling every, the 3D geometry, of the placement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct. So the aspect of this robot that is unique is that it's not surgeon-assisted or human-assisted. It's a semi-automatic or automatic robot. Obviously, there are human component to it, when you're placing targets, you can always move it away from major vessels that you see. But we want to get to a point where one click and it just does the surgery within minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the computer vision component finds great targets, candidates, and the human approves them, and the robot does... Does it do one thread at a time? Or does it do them [inaudible 02:19:08]?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It does one thread at a time. And that's actually also one thing that we are looking at ways to do multiple threads at a time. There's nothing stopping from it. You can have multiple kind of engagement mechanisms. But right now, it's one-by-one. And we also still do quite a bit of just kind of verification to make sure that it got inserted. If so, how deep? Did it actually match what was programmed in? And so on and so forth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the actual electrodes are placed at differing depths in the... I mean, it's very small differences, but differences.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's some reasoning behind that, as you mentioned, it gets more varied signal.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we try to place them all around three or four millimeter from the surface. ... it's three or four millimeter from the surface just because the span of the electrode, those 16 electrodes that we currently have in this version, spans roughly around three millimeters. So we want to get all of those in the brain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is fascinating. Okay, so there's a million questions here. If we could zoom in specifically on the electrodes. What is your sense, how many neurons is each individual electrode listening to?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, each electrode can record from anywhere between zero to 40, as I mentioned earlier. But practically speaking, we only see about at most two to three, and you can actually distinguish which neuron it's coming from by the shape of the spikes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mentioned the spike detection algorithm that we have, it's called BOSS algorithm, Buffer Online Spike Sorter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It actually outputs at the end of the day six unique values, which are the amplitude of these negative going hump, middle hump, positive going hump, and then also the time at which these happen. And from that, you can have a statistical probability estimation of, \"Is that a spike? Is it not a spike?\" And then based on that, you could also determine, \"Oh, that spike looks different than that spike, it must come from a different neuron.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So that's a nice signal processing step from which you can then make much better predictions about if there's a spike, especially in this kind of context, where there could be multiple neurons screaming. And that that also results in you being able to compress the data better at the of the day.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, that's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And just to be clear, I mean, the labs do this what's called spike sorting. Usually once you have the fully digitized signals and then you run a bunch of different set of algorithms to tease apart, it's just all of this for us is done on the device.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the device.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In a very low power, custom-built ASIC digital processing unit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Highly heat constrained.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Highly heat constrained. And the processing time from signal going in and giving you the output is less than a microsecond, which is a very, very short amount of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah. So the latency has to be super short.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow. Oh, that's a pain in the ass. That's really tough.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, latency is this huge, huge thing that you have to deal with. Right now the biggest source of latency comes from the Bluetooth, the way in which their packetized and we bin them in a 15 millisecond time window.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, interesting, so it's communication constrained. Is there some potential innovation there on the protocol used?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Bluetooth is definitely not our final wireless communication protocol that we want to get to. It's highly-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hence, the N1 and the R1. I imagine that increases [inaudible 02:23:03].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Nx, Rx.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the communication protocol because Bluetooth allows you to communicate, gets farther distances than you need to, so you can go much shorter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The only, well, the primary motivation for choosing Bluetooth is that, I mean, everything has Bluetooth,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, so you can talk to any device.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Interoperability is just absolutely essential, especially in this early phase. And in many ways, if you can access a phone or a computer, you can do anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It'll be interesting to step back and actually look at, again, the same pipeline that you mentioned for Noland. What does this whole process look like from finding and selecting a human being, to the surgery, to the first time he's able to use this thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you can use it at home. You don't actually have to go to the lab and go to the clinic to get connectedorized to these specialized equipment that you can't take home with you. So that's one of the key elements of when we're designing the system that we wanted to keep in mind, people hopefully would want to be able to use this every day in the comfort of their homes. And so part of our engagement and what we're looking for during BCI home audit is to just understand their situation, what other assisted technology that they use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we should also step back and say that the estimate is 180,000 people live with quadriplegia in the United States, and each year an additional 18,000 suffer a paralyzing spinal cord injury. So these are folks who have a lot of challenges living a life in terms of accessibility, in terms of doing the things that many of us just take for granted day to day. And one of the things, one of the goals of this initial study is to enable them to have digital autonomy where they by themselves can interact with a digital device using just their mind, something that you're calling telepathy, so digital telepathy. Where a quadriplegic can communicate with a digital device in all the ways that we've been talking about. Control the mouse cursor enough to be able to do all kinds of stuff, including play games and tweet and all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of people for whom life, the basics of life, are difficult because of the things that have happened to them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, movement is so fundamental to our existence. I mean, even speaking involves movement of mouth, lip, larynx. And without that, it's extremely debilitating. And there are many, many people that we can help. I mean, especially if you start to look at other forms of movement disorders that are not just from spinal cord injury, but from a ALS, MS, or even stroke, or just aging, that leads you to lose some of that mobility, that independence, it's extremely debilitating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And all of these are opportunities to help people, to help alleviate suffering, to help improve the quality of life. But each of the things you mentioned is its own little puzzle that needs to have increasing levels of capability from a device like a Neuralink device. And so the first one you're focusing on is, it's just a beautiful word, telepathy. So being able to communicate using your mind wirelessly with a digital device. Can you just explain exactly what we're talking about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, it's exactly that. I mean, I think if you are able to control a cursor and able to click and be able to get access to a computer or a phone, I mean, the whole world opens up to you. And I mean, I guess the word \"telepathy,\" if you think about that as just definitionally being able to transfer information from my brain to your brain without using some of the physical faculties that we have, like voices.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the interesting thing here is I think the thing that's not obviously clear is how exactly it works. In order to move a cursor, there's at least a couple of ways of doing that. One is you imagine yourself maybe moving a mouse with your hand, or you can then, which no one talked about, imagine moving the cursor with your mind. But it's like there is a cognitive step here that's fascinating, because you have to use the brain and you have to learn how to use the brain, and you have to figure it out dynamically because you reward yourself if it works. I mean, there's a step that ... This is just a fascinating step because you have to get the brain to start firing in the right way. And you do that by imagining ... Like fake it till you make it. And all of a sudden it creates the right kind of signal that, if decoded correctly, can create the effect. And then there's noise around that that you have to figure all of that out. But on the human side, imagine the cursor moving is what you have to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. He says using the force.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The force. I mean, isn't that just fascinating to you that it works? To me, it's like, holy shit, that actually works. You could move a cursor with your mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As much as you're learning to use that thing, that thing is also learning about you. Our model's constantly updating the way to say, \"Oh, if someone is thinking about this sophisticated forms of spiking patterns, that actually means to do this.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine, so there is a adaptability to the signal process and the decoding step, and then there's the adaptation of Nolan, the human being. The same way, if you give me a new mouse and I move it, I learn very quickly about its sensitivity, so I learn to move it slower. And then there's other signal drift and all that kind of stuff they have to adapt to, so both are adapting to each other.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a fascinating software challenge, on both sides. The software on both, on the human software and the [inaudible 02:30:41] software.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The organic and the inorganic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The organic and the inorganic. Anyway. Sorry to rudely interrupt. So there's the selection that Noland has passed with flying colors. Everything, including that it is a BCI-friendly home, all of that. So what is the process of the surgery, implantation, the first moment when he gets to use the system?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>insert. And by the time it's been around anywhere between one to one and a half hours, robot comes in, does his thing, placement of the targets, inserting of the thread. That takes anywhere between 20 to 40 minutes. In the particular case for Noland, it was just under or just over 30 minutes. And then after that, the surgeon comes in, there's a couple other steps of actually inserting the dural substitute layer to protect the thread as well as the brain. And then screw in the implant and then skin flap and then suture, and then you're out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when Noland woke up, what was that like? What was the recovery like, and when was the first time he was able to use it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He was actually immediately after the surgery, like an hour after the surgery, as he was waking up, we did turn on the device, make sure that we are recording neural signals. And we actually did have couple signals that we noticed that he can actually modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about clenching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's awesome.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that was immediate, immediate after in the recovery room.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How cool is that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a human being ... I mean, what did that feel like for you? This device and a human being, a first step of a gigantic journey? I mean, it's a historic moment, even just that spike, just to be able to modulate that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and definitely the day before the surgery. And it was an early morning surgery. We started at 7:00 in the morning, and by the time it was around 10:30 everything was done. But I mean, first time seeing that, well, number one, just huge relief that this thing is doing what it's supposed to do. And two, I mean, just immense amount of gratitude for Noland and his family. And then many others that have applied and that we've spoken to and will speak to are true pioneers in every word. And I call them the neural astronauts or neuralnaut.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Neuralnaut, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like in the '60s, these amazing just pioneers exploring the unknown outwards, in this case it's inward, but an incredible amount of gratitude for them to just participate and play a part. And it's a journey that we're embarking on together. But also, I think it was just a ... That was a very, very important milestone, but our work was just starting. So a lot of just anticipation for, \"Okay, what needs to happen next?\" What are set of sequences of events that needs to happen for us to make it worthwhile for both Noland as well as us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to linger on that, just a huge congratulations to you and the team for that milestone. I know there's a lot of work left, but that's really exciting to see. That's a source of hope, it's this first big step, opportunity, to help hundreds of thousands of people. And then maybe expand the realm of the possible for the human mind for millions of people in the future. So it's really exciting. The opportunities are all ahead of us, and to do that safely and to do that effectively was really fun to see. As an engineer, just watching other engineers come together and do an epic thing, that was awesome. So huge congrats.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you, thank you. Yeah, could not have done it without the team. And yeah, I mean, that's the other thing that I told the team as well of just this immense sense of optimism for the future. I mean, it's a very important moment for the company, needless to say, as well as hopefully for many others out there that we can help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of challenges, Neuralink published a blog post describing that some of the threads retracted. And so the performance as measured by bits per second dropped at first, but then eventually it was regained. And the whole story of how it was regained is super interesting, that's definitely something I'll talk to Bliss and to Noland about. But in general, can you speak to this whole experience, how was the performance regained, and just the technical aspects of the threads being retracted and moving?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The main takeaway is that in the end, the performance have come back and it's actually gotten better than it was before. He's actually just beat the world record yet again last week to 8.5 bps. I mean, he's just cranking and he's just improving.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The previous one that he said was eight.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think he said 8.5.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The previous world record in a human was 4.6, so it's almost double. And his goal is to try to get to 10, which is roughly around the median neural linker using a mouse with a hand. So it's getting there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So yeah, so the performance was regained.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>surgery. And it's just a very, very different environment than what we're used to. And this is why we do clinical trial, we want to uncover some of these issues and failure modes earlier than later. So in many ways, it's provided us with this enormous amount of data and information to be able to solve this. And this is something that Neuralink is extremely good at, once we have set of clear objective and engineering problem, we have enormous amount of talents across many, many disciplines to be able to come together and fix the problem very, very quickly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it sounds like one of the fascinating challenges here is for the system on the decoding side to be adaptable across different timescales. So whether it's movement of threads or different aspects of signal drift, sort of on the software or the human brain, something changing, like Noland talks about cursor drift, they could be corrected. And there's a whole UX challenge to how to do that. So it sounds like adaptability is a fundamental property that has to be engineered in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is. I mean, as a company, we're extremely vertically integrated. We make these thin-film arrays in our own microfab.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's like you said, built in-house. This whole paragraph here from this blog post is pretty gangster. \"Building the technologies described above has been no small feat,\" and there's a bunch of links here that I recommend people click on. \"We constructed in-house microfabrication capabilities to rapidly produce various iterations of thin-film arrays that constitute our electrode threads.

What are we looking at here, this thing? \"In less than one minute, our custom-made femtosecond laser mill cuts this geometry in the tips of our needles.\" So we're looking at this weirdly shaped needle. \"The tip is only 10 to 12 microns in width, only slightly larger than the diameter of a red blood cell. The small size allows threads to be inserted with minimal damage to the cortex.\" Okay. So what's interesting about this geometry? So we're looking at this just geometry of a needle.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is the needle that's engaging with the loops in the thread. They're the ones that thread their loop, and then peel it from the silicon backing, and then this is the thing that gets inserted into the tissue. And then this pulls out, leaving the thread.

And then as the head is moving at the speed that it's moving, there's a lot of motion control to make sure that you can achieve that level of precision. A lot of optics that zoom in on that. We're working on next generation of the robot that is lighter, easier to transport.

It feels almost boring winning the gold medal, because you visualized this so many times, you've practiced this so many times, that nothing about it is new. It's boring.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>launched with particular endpoints in mind, at some point you have to euthanize the animal, and then you go through necropsy to collect the brain tissue samples. You fix them in formalin, and you gross them, you section them, and you look at individual slices just to see what kind of reaction or lack thereof exists. So that's the language to which FDA speaks and as well for us to evaluate the safety of the insertion mechanism, as well as the threats at various different time points, both acute, so anywhere between zero to three months to beyond three months.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So those are the details of an extremely high standard of safety that has to be reached.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The FDA supervises this, but there's in general just a very high standard, in every aspect of this, including the surgery. I think Matthew MacDougall has mentioned that the standard is, let's say how to put it politely, higher than maybe some other operations that we take for granted. So the standard for all the surgical stuff here is extremely high.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Very high. I mean, it's a highly, highly regulated environment with the governing agencies that scrutinize every, every medical device that gets marketed. And I think it's a good thing. It's good to have those high standards, and we try to hold extremely high standards to understand what sort of damage, if any, these innovative emerging technologies and new technologies that we're building are. And so far we have been extremely impressed by lack of immune response from these threads.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of which, you talked to me with excitement about the histology in some of the images that you're able to share. Can you explain to me what we're looking at?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is a sectioned tissue slice from an animal that was implanted for seven months, so a chronic time point. And you're seeing all these different colors, and each color indicates specific types of cell types. So purple and pink are astrocytes and microglia, respectably. They're types of glial cells. And the other thing that people may not be aware of is your brain is not just made up of soup of neurons and axons. There are other cells, like glial cells, that actually is the glue and also react if there are any trauma or damage to the tissue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>With the brown or the neurons here?<|eot_id|>"}

And when you zoom into one of those, you see the threads. And then in this particular case, I think we're seeing about the 16 wires that are going into the [inaudible 02:54:56]. And the incredible thing here is the fact that you have the neurons that are these brown structures or brown circular or elliptical thing-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>neuronal death around the site because you're inserting a foreign object. And that elicit these immune response through microglia and astrocytes, they form this protective layer around it. Oh, not only are you killing the neuron cells, but you're also creating this protective layer that then basically prevents you from recording neural signals because you're getting further and further away from the neurons that you're trying to record. And that is the biggest mode of failure. And in this particular example, in that inside it's about 50 micron with that scale bar, the neurons seem to be attracted to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's certainly no trauma. That's such a beautiful image, by the way. So the brown at the neurons, and for some reason I can't look away. It's really cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the right thing?\" So what we did is we did another stain, and this is all done in-house of this Masson's tricrome stain, which is in blue that shows these collagen layer. So the blue, basically, you don't want the blue around the implant threads. Because that means that there's some sort of scarring that's happened. And what you're seeing if you look at individual threads is that you don't see any of the blue. Which means that there has been absolutely, or very, very minimal to a point where it's not detectable amount of trauma in these inserted threads.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that presumably is one of the big benefits of having this kind of flexible thread? This-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So we think this is primarily due to the size as well as the flexibility of the threads. Also, the fact that R1 is avoiding vasculature, so we're not disrupting or we're not causing damage to the vessels and not breaking any of the blood brain barrier, has basically caused the immune response to be muted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But this is also a nice illustration of the size of things. So this is the tip of the thread?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, those are neurons.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they're neurons. And this is the thread listening. And the electrodes are positioned how?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So what you're looking at is not electrode themselves, those are the conductive wires. So each of those should probably be two micron in width. So what we're looking at is, we're looking at the coronal slice, so we're looking at some slice of the tissue. So as you go deeper, you'll obviously have less and less of the tapering of the thread. But yeah, the point basically being that there's just cells around the inserter site, which is just an incredible thing to see. I've just never seen anything like this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How easy and safe is it to remove the implant?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pull them out. And there's minimal trauma that's caused during that. Once the scar tissue forms, and with Noland as well, we believe that that's the thing that's currently anchoring the threats. So we haven't seen any more movements since then. So they're quite stable. It gets harder to actually completely extract the threads. So our current method for removing the device is cutting the thread, leaving the tissue intact, and then unscrewing and taking the implant out. And that hole is now going to be plugged with either another Neuralink or just with a peak based, plastic based cap.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it okay to leave the threads in there forever?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one of the biggest concerns that we had is, do they migrate and do they get to a point where they should not be? We haven't seen that. Again. Once the scar tissue forms, they get anchored in place. And I should also say that when we say upgrades, we're not just talking in theory here, we've actually upgraded many, many times. Most of our monkeys or non-human primates, NHP, have been upgraded. Pager, who you saw playing mind pong has the latest version of the device since two years ago and is seemingly very happy and healthy and fat.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's designed for the future, the upgrade procedure? So maybe for Noland, what would the upgrade look like? It was essentially what you're mentioning. Is there a way to upgrade the device internally where you take it apart and keep the capsule and upgrade the internals?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more of the computational heavy load and the bigger battery. And then one can be under the dura, one can be above the dura being the plug for the skull. They can talk to each other, but the thing that you want to upgrade, the computer and not the thread, if you want to upgrade that, you just go in there, remove the screws, and then put in the next version. And you're off the... It's a very, very easy surgery too. You do a skin incision, slip this in, screw. Probably be able to do this in 10 minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that would allow you to reuse the thread sort of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I mean, this leads to the natural question of what is the pathway to scaling the increase in the number of threads? Is that a priority? What's the technical challenge there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that is a priority. So for next versions of the implant, the key metrics that we're looking to improve are number of channels, just recording from more and more neurons. We have a pathway to actually go from currently 1000 to hopefully 3000, if not 6,000 by end of this year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then end of next year we want to get to even more. 16,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you connectivise that? There's a lot of innovations in the 3D integrations in the recent years that we can take advantage of. One of the biggest challenges that we do have is forming this hermetic barrier. This is an extremely harsh environment that we're in, the brain. So how do you protect it from, yeah, the brain trying to kill your electronics, to also your electronics leaking things that you don't want into the brain. And that forming that hermetic barrier is going to be a very, very big challenge that we, I think are actually well suited to tackle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you test that? What's the development environment to simulate that kind of harshness?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>degrees Celsius that you increase, you're basically accelerating time by two X. And there's limit as to how much temperature you want to increase because at some point there's some other nonlinear dynamics that causes you to have other nasty gases to form that just is not realistic in an environment. So what we do is we increase in our ALT chamber by 20 degrees Celsius that increases the aging by four times. So essentially one day in ALT chamber is four day in calendar year, and we look at whether the implants still are intact, including the threats. And-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And operation and all of that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... and operation and all of that. Obviously, is not an exact same environment as a brain because brain has mechanical other more biological groups that attack at it. But it is a good test environment, testing environment for at least the enclosure and the strength of the enclosure. And I mean, we've had implants, the current version of the implant that has been in there for close to two and a half years, which is equivalent to a decade and they seem to be fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's interesting that basically close approximation is warm salt water, hot salt water is a good testing environment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, I'm drinking LMNT , which is basically salt water. Which is making me kind of... It doesn't have computational power the way the brain does, but maybe in terms of other characteristics, it's quite similar and I'm consuming it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You have to get it in the right pH too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then consciousness will emerge. Yeah, no. All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>titanium can that's laser welded.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is if we go to other parts of the brain, like visual cortex, which we're interested in as our second product, obviously it's a completely different environment, the cortex is laid out very, very differently. It's going to be more stimulation focus rather than recording, just kind of creating visual percepts. But in the end, we're using the same thin film array technology, we're using the same robot insertion technology, we're using the same packaging technology. Now it's where the conversation is focused around what are the differences and what are the implication of those differences in safety and efficacy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way you said second product is both hilarious and awesome to me. That product being restoring sight for blind people. So can you speak to stimulating the visual cortex?

There's actually million people, 1 million people in the US that are legally blind. That means certain score below in the visual tests. I think it's something like if you can see something at 20 feet distance that normal people can see at 200 feet distance, if you're worse than that, you're legally blind.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So fundamental that means you can't function effectively using sight in the world.<|eot_id|>"}

You can have infrared, you can have UV, you can have whatever other spectrum that you want to see. And whether that gets matched to some sort of weird conscious experience, I've no idea. But oftentimes I talk to people about the goal of Neuralink being going beyond the limits of our biology. That's sort of what I mean.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you're able to control the kind of raw signal, is that when we use our site, we're getting the photons and there's not much processing on it. If you're being able to control that signal, maybe you can do some kind of processing, maybe you do object detection ahead of time. You're doing some kind of pre-processing and there's a lot of possibilities to explore that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>device. And that's how it works in the US and just generally around the world. That's the process you follow. So our goal is to really just understand from people like Noland, P2, P3, future participants, what aspects of our device needs to improve. If it turns out that people are like, \"I really don't like the fact that it lasts only six hours. I want to be able to use this computer for 24 hours.\" I mean, that is a user needs and user requirements, which we can only find out from just being able to engage with them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So before the pivotal study, there's kind of a rapid innovation based on individual experiences. You're learning from individual people, how they use it, the high resolution details in terms of cursor control and signal and all that kind of stuff, life experience.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to how your phones get updated all the time with new firmware for security patches, whatever, new functionality, UI. And that's something that is possible with our implant. It's not a static one-time device that can only do... It's not a static one-time device that can only do the thing that it said it can do. I mean, it's similar to Tesla, you can do over-the-air firmware updates, and now you have completely new user interface and all these bells and whistles and improvements on everything, like the latest. Right? When we say generalized platform, that's what we're talking about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's really cool how the app that Noland is using, there's calibration, all that kind of stuff, and then there's update. You just click and get an update. What other future capabilities are you looking to? You said vision. That's a fascinating one. What about accelerated typing or speech, or this kind of stuff? And what else is there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And those are actually looking more at parts of the motor cortex that are controlling these vocal articulators, and being able to, even by mouthing the word or imagine speech, you can pick up those signals. The more sophisticated higher level processing areas like the Broca's area or Wernicke's area, those are still very, very big mystery in terms of the underlying mechanism of how all that stuff works. But I mean, I think Neuralink's eventual goal is to understand those things and be able to provide a platform and tools to be able to understand that and study that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is where I get to the pothead questions. Do you think we can start getting insight into things like thought? So, speech, there's a muscular component, like you said, there's the act of producing sounds, but then what about the internal things like cognition, like low-level thoughts and high-level thoughts? Do you think we'll start noticing signals that could be picked up, they could be understood, that could be maybe used in order to interact with the outside world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thinking this versus ... And you can either learn from many, many sets of data to correlate some of that and be able to do mind reading or not. I'm not sure. I certainly would not rule that out as a possibility, but I think BCI alone probably can't do that. There's probably additional set of tools and framework and also just hard problem of consciousness, at the end of the day, is rooted in this philosophical question of what is the meaning of it all? What's the nature of our existence? Where's the mind emerged from this complex network?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. How does the subjective experience emerge from just a bunch of spikes, electrical spikes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>left legs or right legs, you just feel like one legs, right? So, what is happening there? Right? If you actually look at the two hemispheres, there's a structure that kind of connectorized the two, called the corpus callosum, that is supposed to have around 200 to 300 million connections or axons. So, whether that means that's the number of interface and electrodes that we need to create some sort of mind meld or from that whatever new conscious experience that you can experience. But I do think that there's kind of an interesting existence proof that we all have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that threshold is unknown at this time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah. Everything in this domain is speculation. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then, you'd be continuously pleasantly surprised. Do you see a world where there is millions of people, like tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people walking around with a Neuralink device or multiple Neuralink devices in their brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. First of all, there are, if you look at worldwide, people suffering from movement disorders and visual deficits, I mean, that's in the tens if not hundreds of millions of people. So, that alone, I think there's a lot of benefit and potential good that we can do with this type of technology. And once you start to get into psychiatric application, depression, anxiety, hunger or obesity, right? Mood, control of appetite. I mean, that starts to become very real to everyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to mention that most people on Earth have a smartphone, and once BCI starts competing with a smartphone as a preferred methodology of interacting with the digital world, that also becomes an interesting thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, this is even before going to that, right? There's almost, I mean, the entire world that could benefit from these types of things. And then, if we're talking about next generation of how we interface with machines or even ourselves, in many ways, I think BCI can play a role in that. And some of the things that I also talk about is, I do think that there is a real possibility that you could see 8 billion people walking around with Neuralink.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, thank you so much for pushing ahead.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>triumphs in human history. You think about all the really horrific tragedies. You think about the Holocaust, you think about any prison full of human stories, and all of those problems boil down to neurochemistry. So, if you get a little bit of control over that, you provide people the option to do better. In the way I read history, the way people have dealt with having better tools is that they most often, in the end, do better, with huge asterisks. But I think it's an interesting, a worthy, a noble pursuit to give people more options, more tools.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's a fascinating way to look at human history. You just imagine all these neurobiological mechanisms, Stalin, Hitler, Genghis Khan, all of them just had a brain, just a bunch of neurons, few times of billions of neurons gaining a bunch of information over a period of time. They have a set of modules that does language and memory and all that. And from there, in the case of those people, they're able to murder millions of people. And all that coming from ... There's not some glorified notion of a dictator of this enormous mind or something like this. It's just the brain.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a lot of that has to do with how well people like that can organize those around them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Other brains.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with understandable goals and drives, what they want out of life. And primarily, it's the things we want out of life, food, sex, companionship, power. You can understand chimp and bonobo behavior in the same lights much more easily. And I think doing so gives you the tools you need to reduce human behavior from the kind of false complexity that we layer onto it with language, and look at it in terms of, oh, well, these humans are looking for companionship, sex, food, power. And I think that that's a pretty powerful tool to have in understanding human behavior.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I just went to the Amazon jungle for a few weeks and it's a very visceral reminder that a lot of life on Earth is just trying to get laid. They're all screaming at each other. I saw a lot of monkeys and they're just trying to impress each other, or maybe if there's a battle for power, but a lot of the battle for power has to do with them getting laid.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Breeding rights often go with alpha status. And so, if you can get a piece of that, then you're going to do okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we'd like to think that we're somehow fundamentally different, and especially when it comes to primates, we really aren't. We can use fancier poetic language, but maybe some of the underlying drives and motivators are similar.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think that's true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And all of that is coming from this, the brain.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, when did you first start studying the brain as the biological mechanism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>huge role in almost everything that your body does. You try to name an example of something in your body that isn't directly controlled or massively influenced by the brain, and it's pretty hard. I mean, you might say like bone healing or something. But even those systems, the hypothalamus and pituitary end up playing a role in coordinating the endocrine system, that does have a direct influence on say, the calcium level in your blood, that goes to bone healing. So, non-obvious connections between those things implicate the brain as really a potent prime mover in all of health.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things I realized in the other direction too, how most of the systems in the body are integrated with the human brain, they affect the brain also, like the immune system. I think there's just, people who study Alzheimer's and those kinds of things, it's just surprising how much you can understand of that from the immune system, from the other systems that don't obviously seem to have anything to do with the nervous system. They all play together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to tell your brain, \"Hey, now be antisocial for a few days. Don't go be the life of the party tonight. In fact, maybe just cuddle up somewhere warm, under a blanket, and just stay there for a day or two.\" And sure enough, that tends to be the behavior that you see both in animals and in humans. If you get sick, elevated levels of interleukins in your blood and TNF-alpha in your blood, ask the brain to cut back on social activity and even moving around, you have lower locomotor activity in animals that are infected with viruses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, from there, the early days in neuroscience to surgery, when did that step happen? Which is a leap.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>distant gods that live on another planet and occasionally come and visit us, to these are humans that have problems and are people, and there's nothing fundamentally preventing me from being one of them. And so, at the last minute in medical school, I changed gears from going into a different specialty and switched into neurosurgery, which cost me a year. I had to do another year of research because I was so far along in the process that to switch into neurosurgery, the deadlines had already passed. So, it was a decision that cost time, but absolutely worth it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the hardest part of the training on the neurosurgeon track?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think, internally among the residents as weakness. And so, most neurosurgery residents try to work as hard as they can, and that, I think necessarily means working long hours and sometimes over the work hour limits. We care about being compliant with whatever regulations are in front of us, but I think more important than that, people want to give their all in becoming a better neurosurgeon because the stakes are so high. And so, it's a real fight to get residents to say, go home at the end of their shift and not stay and do more surgery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you seriously saying one of the hardest things is literally forcing them to get sleep and rest and all this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Historically that was the case.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's hilarious. And that's awesome.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The personalities. And maybe the two are connected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, was it pretty competitive?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's competitive, and it's also, as we touched on earlier, primates like power. And I think neurosurgery has long had this aura of mystique and excellence and whatever about it. And so, it's an invitation, I think, for people that are cloaked in that authority. A board certified neurosurgeon is basically a walking fallacious appeal to authority. Right? You have license to walk into any room and act like you're an expert on whatever. And fighting that tendency is not something that most neurosurgeons do well. Humility isn't the forte.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I have friends who know you and whenever they speak about you that you have the surprising quality for a neurosurgeon of humility, which I think indicates that it's not as common as perhaps in other professions, because there is a kind of gigantic sort of heroic aspect to neurosurgery, and I think it gets to people's head a little bit.<|eot_id|>"}

Working hard to make people that you passionately dislike look good the next morning. These folks were relentless in their pursuit of excellent neurosurgical technique, decade over decade, and I think were well-recognized for that excellence. So, especially Marty Weiss, Steve Giannotta, Mike Apuzzo, they made huge contributions not only to surgical technique, but they built training programs that trained dozens or hundreds of amazing neurosurgeons. I was just lucky to be in their wake.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's that like ... You mentioned doing a surgery where the person is likely not to survive. Does that wear on you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to make the world worse for people for a long time. And it's just hard to feel powerless in the face of that. And that's where I think you have to be borderline evil to fight against a company like Neuralink or to constantly be taking pot shots at us, because what we're doing is to try to fix that stuff. We're trying to give people options to reduce suffering. We're trying to take the pain out of life that broken brains brings in. And yeah, this is just our little way that we're fighting back against entropy, I guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The amount of suffering that's endured when some of the things that we take for granted that our brain is able to do is taken away, is immense. And to be able to restore some of that functionality is a real gift.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We're just starting. We're going to do so much more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, can you take me through the full procedure for implanting, say, the N1 chip in Neuralink?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in people's skulls, presumably to let out the evil spirits, but maybe to drain blood clots. And there's evidence of bone healing around the edge, meaning the people at least survived some months after a procedure. And so, what we're doing is that. We are making a cut in the skin on the top of the head over the area of the brain that is the most potent representation of hand intentions. And so, if you are an expert concert pianist, this part of your brain is lighting up the entire time you're playing. We call it the hand knob.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The hand knob. So, it's all the finger movements, all of that is just firing away.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the human comes back in and puts the implant into that hole in the skull and covers it up, screwing it down to the skull and sewing the skin back together. So the whole thing is a few hours long. It's extremely low risk compared to the average neurosurgery involving the brain that might, say, open up a deeper part of the brain or manipulate blood vessels in the brain. This opening on the surface of the brain with only cortical micro- insertions carries significantly less risk than a lot of the tumor or aneurysm surgeries that are routinely done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So cortical micro-insertions that are via robot and computer vision are designed to avoid the blood vessels.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I know you're a bit biased here, but let's compare human and machine.

Robots wouldn't do so well in that situation, at least in their current incarnation, fully robotic surgery, like the electrode insertion portion of the neural link surgery, it goes according to a set plan. And so the humans can interrupt the flow and change the plan, but the robot can't really change the plan midway through. It operates according to how it was programmed and how it was asked to run. It does its job very precisely, but not with a wide degree of latitude in how to react to changing conditions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there could be just a very large number of ways that you could be surprised as a surgeon? When you enter a situation, there could be subtle things that you have to dynamically adjust to.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And robots are not good at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Currently.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Currently.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we are at the dawn of a new era with AI of the parameters for robot responsiveness to be dramatically broadened, right? I mean, you can't look at a self-driving car and say that it's operating under very narrow parameters. If a chicken runs across the road, it wasn't necessarily programmed to deal with that specifically, but a Waymo or a self-driving Tesla would have no problem reacting to that appropriately. And so surgical robots aren't there yet, but give it time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there could be a lot of semi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a robotic surgeon could say this situation is perfectly familiar, or this situation is not familiar, and in the not familiar case, a human could take over, but basically be very conservative in saying, okay, this for sure has no issues, no surprises, and let the humans deal with the surprises with the edge cases and all that. That's one possibility. So you think eventually you'll be out of the job? Well, you being neurosurgeon, your job being a neurosurgeon. Humans, there will not be many neurosurgeons left on this earth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm not worried about my job in the course of my professional life. I think I would tell my kids not necessarily to go in this line of work depending on how things look in 20 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so fascinating because if I have a line of work, I would say it's programming. And if you ask me, for the last, I don't know, 20 years, what I would recommend for people, I would tell them, yeah, you'll always have a job if you're a programmer because there's more and more computers and all this kind of stuff and it pays well. But then you realize these large language models come along and they're really damn good at generating code. So overnight you could be surprised like, wow, what is the contribution of the human really? But then you start to think, okay, it does seem that humans have ability, like you said, to deal with novel situations. In the case of programming, it's the ability to come up with novel ideas to solve problems. It seems like machines aren't quite yet able to do that. And when the stakes are very high, when it's life critical as it is in surgery, especially in neurosurgery, then the stakes are very high for a robot to actually replace a human.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think wealth is easy to hate or envy or whatever, and I think there's a whole industry around driving clicks and bad news is great for clicks, and so any way to take an event and turn it into bad news is going to be really good for clicks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just sucks because I think it puts pressure on people. It discourages people from trying to solve really hard problems because to solve hard problems, you have to go into the unknown. You have to do things that haven't been done before and you have to take risks, calculated risks, you have to do all kinds of safety precautions, but risks nevertheless. I just wish there would be more celebration of that, of the risk taking versus people just waiting on the sidelines waiting for failure and then pointing out the failure. Yeah, it sucks. But in this case, it's really great that everything went just flawlessly, but it's unnecessary pressure, I would say.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now that there's a human with literal skin in the game, there's a participant whose well-being rides on this doing well.

And so hopefully people look in the mirror and realize that at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So did you get to actually front row seat, watch the robot work? You get to see the whole thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, because an MD needs to be in charge of all of the medical decision-making throughout the process, I unscrubbed from the surgery after exposing the brain and presenting it to the robot and placed the targets on the robot software interface that tells the robot where it's going to insert each thread. That was done with my hand on the mouse, for whatever that's worth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you were the one placing the targets?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, cool. So the robot with a computer vision provides a bunch of candidates and you kind of finalize the decision.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. The software engineers are amazing on this team, and so they actually provided an interface where you can essentially use a lasso tool and select a prime area of brain real estate, and it will automatically avoid the blood vessels in that region and automatically place a bunch of targets. That allows the human robot operator to select really good areas of brain and make dense applications of targets in those regions, the regions we think are going to have the most high fidelity representations of finger movements and arm movement intentions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've seen images of this and for me with OCD, for some reason, are really pleasant. I think there's a Subreddit called Oddly Satisfying.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, love that Subreddit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's oddly satisfying to see the different target sites avoiding the blood vessels and also maximizing the usefulness of those locations for the signal. It just feels good. It's like, ah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As a person who has a visceral reaction to the brain bleeding, I can tell you it's extremely satisfying watching the electrodes themselves go into the brain and not cause bleeding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. So you said the feeling was of relief when everything went perfectly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How deep in the brain can you currently go and eventually go, let's say on the Neuralink side. It seems the deeper you go in the brain, the more challenging it becomes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So talking broadly about neurosurgery, we can get anywhere. It's routine for me to put deep brain stimulating electrodes near the very bottom of the brain, entering from the top and passing about a two millimeter wire all the way into the bottom of the brain. And that's not revolutionary, a lot of people do that, and we can do that with very high precision. I use a robot from Globus to do that surgery several times a month. It's pretty routine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are your eyes in that situation? What are you seeing? What kind of technology can you use to visualize where you are to light your way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>passing that wire blindly into the deep part of the brain. That's not an acceptable safety profile for Neuralink. We start from the position that we want this to be dramatically maybe two or three orders of magnitude safer than that, safe enough, really, that you or I, without a profound medical problem, might on our lunch break someday say, \"Yeah, sure, I'll get that. I'd been meaning to upgrade to the latest version.\" And so the safety constraints given that are high, and so we haven't settled on a final solution for arbitrarily approaching deep targets in the brain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting because you have to avoid blood vessels somehow, and you have to... Maybe there's creative ways of doing the same thing, like mapping out high resolution geometry of blood vessels, and then you can go in blind, but how do you map out that in a way that's super stable? There's a lot of interesting challenges there, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's a lot to do on the surface.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. So we've got vision on the surface. We actually have made a huge amount of progress sewing electrodes into the spinal cord as a potential workaround for a spinal cord injury that would allow a brain mounted implant to translate motor intentions to a spine mounted implant that can affect muscle contractions in previously paralyzed arms and legs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's mind blowing. That's just incredible. So the effort there is to try to bridge the brain to the spinal cord to the peripheral in your nervous... So how hard is that to do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We have that working in very crude forms in animals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's amazing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we've done...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So similar to with Noland where he's able to digitally move the cursor. Here you're doing the same kind of communication, but with the effectors that you have.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we have anesthetized animals doing grasp and moving their legs in a sort of walking pattern. Again, early days, but the future is bright for this kind of thing, and people with paralysis should look forward to that bright future. They're going to have options.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a lot of sort of intermediate or extra options where you take an optimist robot like the arm, and to be able to control the arm, the fingers and hands of the arm as a prosthetic.<|eot_id|>"}

Although I didn't quite understand until thinking about it deeply and doing more research about Neuralink how much you can do on the digital side. So this digital telepathy. I didn't quite understand that you can really map the intention, as you described in the hand knob area, that you can map the intention. Just imagine it. Think about it. That intention can be mapped to actual action in the digital world, and now more and more, so much can be done in the digital world that it can reconnect you to the outside world. It can allow you to have freedom, have independence if you're a quadriplegic. That's really powerful. You can go really far with that.<|eot_id|>"}

He's breaking world records left and right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he's having fun with it. It's great. Just going back to the surgery. Your whole journey, you mentioned to me offline you have surgery on Monday, so like you're doing surgery all the time. Yeah. Maybe the ridiculous question, what does it take to get good at surgery?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>spend some chunk of your life, some percentage of your life focusing on this, obsessing about getting better at it. Repetitions, humility, recognizing that you aren't perfect at any stage along the way, recognizing you've got improvements to make in your technique, being open to feedback and coaching from people with a different perspective on how to do it, and then just the constant will to do better. That, fortunately, if you're not a sociopath, I think your patients bring that with them to the office visits every day. They force you to want to do better all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just step up. I mean, it's a real human being, a real human being that you can help.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So every surgery, even if it's the same exact surgery, is there a lot of variability between that surgery in a different person?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the frame that we use and how the robot has to approach the skull. Yeah, people's bodies are built as differently as the people you see walking down the street, as much variability and body shape and size as you see there. We see in brain anatomy and skull anatomy, there are some people who we've had to exclude from our trial for having skulls that are too thick or too thin or scalp that's too thick or too thin. I think we have the middle 97% or so of people, but you can't account for all human anatomy variability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much mushiness and mess is there? Because taking biology classes, the diagrams are always really clean and crisp. Neuroscience, the pictures of neurons are always really nice and [inaudible 04:32:44], but whenever I look at pictures of real brains, they're all... I don't know what is going on. So how much our biological systems in reality, how hard is it to figure out what's going on?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thousand brains, it becomes easier to kind of mentally peel back the, say, for instance, blood vessels that are obscuring the sulci and gyri, know kind of the wrinkle pattern of the surface of the brain. Occasionally when you're first starting to do this and you open the skull, it doesn't match what you thought you were going to see based on the MRI. And with more experience, you learn to kind of peel back that layer of blood vessels and see the underlying pattern of wrinkles in the brain and use that as a landmark for where you are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The wrinkles are a landmark?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So I was describing hand knob earlier. That's a pattern of the wrinkles in the brain. It's sort of this Greek letter, omega shaped area of the brain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you could recognize the hand knob area. If I show you a thousand brains and give you one minute with each, you'd be like, \"Yep, that's that.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there is some uniqueness to that area of the brain in terms of the geometry, the topology of the thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where is it about in the...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>lays with his legs up at the top of the brain and face arm areas farther down, and then some kind of mouth, lip, tongue areas farther down. And so the hand is right in there, and then the areas that control speech, at least on the left side of the brain in most people are just below that. And so any muscle that you voluntarily move in your body, the vast majority of that references that strip or those intentions come from that strip of brain, and the wrinkle for hand knob is right in the middle of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And vision is back here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also close to the surface.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Vision's a little deeper. And so this gets to your question about how deep can you get. To do vision, we can't just do the surface of the brain. We have to be able to go in, not as deep as we'd have to go for DBS, but maybe a centimeter deeper than we're used to for hand insertions. And so that's work in progress. That's a new set of challenges to overcome.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, you mentioned the Utah Array and I just saw a picture of that and that thing looks terrifying.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The nails.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's because it's rigid and then if you look at the threads, they're flexible. What can you say that's interesting to you about that kind of approach of the flexible threads to deliver the electrodes next to the neurons?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the brain, and then treating that with chemotherapy to try to prevent scar tissue, it's like, maybe we've gotten off track here, guys. Maybe there's a fundamental redesign necessary. And so Neuralink's approach of using highly flexible, tiny electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding, avoids a lot of the immune response that ends up happening when rigid electrodes are pounded into the brain. And so what we see is our electrode longevity and functionality and the health of the brain tissue immediately surrounding the electrode is excellent. I mean, it goes on for years now in our animal models.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do most people not understand about the biology of the brain? We will mention the vasculature. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>underappreciated fact is that it really does control almost everything. I don't know, for an out of the blue example, imagine you want a lever on fertility. You want to be able to turn fertility on and off. There are legitimate targets in the brain itself to modulate fertility, say blood pressure. You want to modulate blood pressure, there are legitimate targets in the brain for doing that. Things that aren't immediately obvious as brain problems are potentially solvable in the brain. And so I think it's an under-explored area for primary treatments of all the things that bother people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really fascinating way to look at it. There's a lot of conditions we might think have nothing to do with the brain, but they might just be symptoms of something that actually started in the brain. The actual source of the problem, the primary source is something in the brain.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Not always. I mean, kidney disease is real, but there are levers you can pull in the brain that affect all of these systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's knobs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On-off switches and knobs in the brain from which this all originates. Would you have a Neuralink chip implanted in your brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think use case right now is use a mouse, right? I can already do that, and so there's no value proposition. On safety grounds alone, sure. I'll do it tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You know, when you say the use case of the mouse, is it... The use case of the mouse is after researching all this and part of it's just watching Nolan have so much fun. If you can get that bits per second look really high with the mouse, being able to interact, because if you think about the way on the smartphone, the way you swipe, that was transformational. How we interact with the thing, it's subtle, you don't realize it, but to be able to touch a phone and to scroll with your finger, that changed everything. People were sure you need a keyboard to type. There's a lot of HCI aspects to that that changed how we interact with computers, so there could be a certain rate of speed with the mouse that would change everything. You might be able to just click around a screen extremely fast. I can't see myself getting a Neuralink for much more rapid interaction with the digital devices.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think recording speech intentions from the brain might change things as well, the value proposition for the average person. A keyboard is a pretty clunky human interface, requires a lot of training. It's highly variable in the maximum performance that the average person can achieve. I think taking that out of the equation and just having a natural word to computer interface might change things for a lot of people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It'd be hilarious if that is the reason people do it. Even if you have speech to text, that's extremely accurate. It currently isn't, but it'd say you've gotten super accurate. It'd be hilarious if people went for Neuralink. Just so you avoid the embarrassing aspect of speaking, looking like a douchebag speaking to your phone in public, which is a real, that's a real constraint.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean with a bone conducting case, that can be an invisible headphone, say, and the ability to think words into software and have it respond to you. That starts to sound sort of like embedded super intelligence. If you can silently ask for the Wikipedia article on any subject and have it read to you without any observable change happening in the outside world. For one thing, standardized testing is obsolete.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If it's done well in the UX side, it could change, I don't know if it transforms society, but it really can create a kind of shift in the way we interact with digital devices in the way that a smartphone did. Just having to look into the safety of everything involved, I would totally try it. So it doesn't have to go to some incredible thing where you have, it connects your vision or to some other, it connects all over your brain. That could be just connecting to the hand knob. You might have a lot of interesting interaction, human computer interaction possibilities. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the technology on the academic side is progressing at light speed here.

It was something like 125,000 words that they were getting with very high accuracy, which is-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're just thinking the word?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thinking the word and you're able to get it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, boy. You have to have the intention of speaking it. So do the inner voice. Man, it's so amazing to me that you can do the intention, the signal mapping. All you have to do is just imagine yourself doing it. And if you get the feedback that it actually worked, you can get really good at that. Your brain will first of all adjust and you develop, like any other skill, like touch typing. You develop in that same kind of way. To me, it's just really fascinating to be able to even to play with that, honestly, I would get a Neuralink just to be able to play with that, just to play with the capacity, the capability of my mind to learn this skill. It's like learning the skill of typing and learning the skill of moving a mouse. It's another skill of moving the mouse, not with my physical body, but with my mind.<|eot_id|>"}

The biological brain and the electronic brain outside of it working together, the possibilities there are really interesting. It's still unknown, but interesting.

We want to get away from requiring intense expertise or intense experience to have this done and make it as simple and translatable as possible. I mean, I would love it if every neurosurgeon on the planet had no problem doing this. I think we're probably far from a regulatory environment that would allow people that aren't neurosurgeons to do this, but not impossible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, I'll sign up for that.

I mean, I'm sure you've had friends that aren't living anymore and it's hard to even think about them. And so I wish I had arrived at the point of nirvana where death doesn't have a sting, I'm not worried about it. But I can at least say that I'm comfortable with the certainty of it, if not having found out how to take the tragedy out of it. When I think about my kids either not having me or me not having them or my wife.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe I've come to accept the intellectual certainty of it, but it may be the pain that comes with losing the people you love. But I don't think I've come to understand the existential aspect of it, that this is going to end, and I don't mean in some trite way. I mean, it certainly feels like it's not going to end. You live life like it's not going to end. And the fact that this light that's shining, this consciousness is going to no longer be in one moment, maybe today. It fills me when I really am able to load all that in with Ernest Becker's terror. It is a real fear. I think people aren't always honest with how terrifying it is. I think the more you are able to really think through it, the more terrifying it is. It's not such a simple thing, \"Oh, well, it's the way life is.\" If you really can load that in, it's hard, but I think that's why the Stoics did it, because it helps you get your shit together and be like, \"The moment, every single moment you're alive is just beautiful\" and it's terrifying that it's going to end, and it's almost like you're shivering in the cold, a child helpless. This kind of feeling, And then it makes you, when you have warmth, when you have the safety, when you have the love to really appreciate it. I feel like sometimes in your position when you mentioned armor just to see death, it might make you not be able to see that, the finiteness of life because if you kept looking at that, it might break you. So it is good to know that you're kind of still struggling with that. There's the neurosurgeon and then there's a human, and the human is still able to struggle with that and feel the fear of that and the pain of that.<|eot_id|>"}

I get to help on a project that I think matters. I think it moves us forward. I'm a very lucky person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the early steps of a potentially gigantic leap for humanity. It's a really interesting one. And it's cool because you read about all this stuff in history where it's like the early days. I've been reading, before going to the Amazon, I would read about explorers that would go and explore even the Amazon jungle for the first time. It's just those are the early steps or early steps into space, early steps in any discipline in physics and mathematics, and it's cool because on the grand scale, these are the early steps into delving deep into the human brain, so not just observing the brain but be able to interact with the human brain. It's going to help a lot of people, but it also might help us understand what the hell's going on in there.<|eot_id|>"}

Talk about people that are committing suicide at an alarming rate in this country, and try to justify that queasiness in that light of, you can give people a knob to take away suicidal ideation, suicidal intention. I would give them that knob.

You feel the part of your brain that thinks of red things or winged creatures or the taste of coffee. You feel those parts of your brain being active, the way that I'm feeling my palm being touched, and that sensory system that feels the brain working is consciousness.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's so brilliant.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some folks, it's as simple as just being able to respond to their kid in time before they run away or get interested in something else.

This is a problem that with the right resources, with the right team, can make a lot of progress on. And at the end of the day, I think that's a deeply inspiring message and something that makes me excited to get up every day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's both an engineering problem in terms of a BCI, for example, that can give them capabilities where they can interact with the world, but also on the other side, it's an engineering problem for the rest of the world to make it more accessible for people living with quadriplegia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and his words why this device is impactful for him, and it's a nuanced topic. It can be the case that even if you can achieve the same thing, for example, with a mouse stick when navigating a computer, he doesn't have access to that mouse stick every single minute of the day. He only has access when someone is available to put it in front of him. And so a BCI can really offer a level of independence and autonomy that, if it wasn't literally physically part of your body, it'd be hard to achieve in any other way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a lot of fascinating aspects to what it takes to get Noland to be able to control a cursor on the screen with his mind. You texted me something that I just love. You said, \"I was part of the team that interviewed and selected P1, I was in the operating room during the first human surgery monitoring live signals coming out of the brain. I work with the user basically every day to develop new UX paradigms, decoding strategies, and I was part of the team that figured out how to recover useful BCI to new world record levels when the signal quality degraded.\" We'll talk about, I think every aspect of that, but just zooming out, what was it like to be a part of that team and part of that historic, I would say, historic first?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>most folks in the room. I got to sit there and think to myself, \"Wow, that brain is moving a lot.\" When you look inside the craniectomy that we stick the threads in, one thing that most people don't realize is the brain moves. The brain moves a lot when you breathe, your heart beats, and you can see it visibly. So that's something that I think was a surprise to me and very, very exciting to be able to see someone's brain who you physically know and have talked with that length, actually pausing and moving inside their skull.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they used that brain to talk to you previously, and now it's right there moving.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's part of the way you test that the thing is working?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the local fuel potential or the voltage essentially measured by that electrode.

And so one of these moments that I'll never forget as part of this whole clinical trial is seeing live in the operating room while he's still under anesthesia, beautiful spikes being shown in the application, just streaming live to a device I'm holding in my hand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is no signal processing the raw data, and then the signals processing is on top of it, you're seeing the spikes detected?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what about when Noland woke up?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>longer and he said, \"Oh, when I move this finger, I see this particular neuron start to fire more.\" And I said, \"Okay, prove it. Do it again.\" And so he said, \"Okay, three, two, one,\" boom. And the minute he moved, you can see instantaneously this neuron is firing, single neuron. I can tell you the exact channel number if you're interested. It's stuck in my brain now forever. But that single channel firing was a beautiful indication that it was behaved really modulated, neural activity, that could then be used for downstreaming tasks, like decoding a computer cursor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you say single channel, is that associated with a single electrode?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Channel and electrode are interchangeable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a 1,024 of those?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>1,024. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's incredible that, that works. When I was learning about all this and loading it in, it was just blowing my mind that the intention, you can visualize yourself moving the finger. That can turn into a signal, and the fact that you can then skip that step and visualize the cursor moving, or have the intention of the cursor moving. And that leading to a signal that can then be used to move the cursor? There is so many exciting things there to learn about the brain, about the way the brain works, the very fact of there existing signal that can be used, is really powerful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it feels like that's just the beginning of figuring out how that signal could be used really, really effectively? I should also just, there's so many fascinating details here, but you mentioned the body mapping step. At least in the version I saw, that Noland was showing off, there's a super nice interface, a graphical interface, but it just felt like I was in the future. I guess it visualizes you moving the hand, and there's a very sexy polished interface that, \"Hello,\" I don't know if there's a voice component, but it just felt like when you wake up in a really nice video game, and this is the tutorial at the beginning of that video game. This is what you're supposed to do. It's cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I mean the future should feel like the future.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's not easy to pull that off. I mean, it needs to be simple, but not too simple.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>BCI development in general. There's a whole interaction effect between the ways in which you visualize an instruction to the user, and the kinds of signal you can get back. And that quality of your behavioral alignment to the neural signal, is a function of how good you are at expressing to the user what you want them to do. And so yeah, we spend a lot of time thinking about the UX, of how we build our applications, of how the decoder actually functions, the control surfaces it provides to the user. All these little details matter a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe it'd be nice to get into a little bit more detail of what the signal looks like, and what the decoding looks like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a N1 implant that has, like we mentioned, 1,024 electrodes, and that's collecting raw data, raw signal. What does that signal look like? And what are the different steps along the way before it's transmitted, and what is transmitted? All that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. This is going to be a fun one. Grab the [inaudible 05:19:58].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this one millisecond or not? And we do that because the actual information carrying subspace of neural activity, is just when our spikes occurring. Essentially everything that we care about for decoding can be captured or represented in the frequency characteristics of spike trains. Meaning, how often are spikes firing in any given window of time. And so that allows us to do sort of a crazy amount of compression, from this very rich high-density signal, to something that's much, much more sparse and compressible, that can be sent out over a wireless radio. Like a Bluetooth communication for example.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Quick tangents here. You mentioned electrode neuron, there's a local neighborhood of neurons nearby. How difficult is it to isolate from where the spike came from?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a totally reasonable trade-off to make, and can simplify the problem a lot. And as you sort of scale out channel count, the relevance of distinguishing individual neurons becomes less important. Because you have more overall signal, and you can start to rely on correlations or covariate structure in the data to help understand when that channel is firing... What does that actually represent? Because you know that when that channel's firing in concert with these other 50 channels, that means move left. But when that same channel's firing with concert with these other 10 channels, that means move right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So you have to do this kind of spike detection onboard, and you have to do that super efficiently? So fast, and not use too much power, because you don't want to be generating too much heat, so it'd have to be a super simple signal processing step?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some wisdom you can share about what it takes to overcome that challenge?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to as the hash of activity, the other stuff that's going on. And you can look at across many channels how that background noise is behaving, and you might be able to get more juice out of the signal that way. But it comes at a cost. That signal is now a floating point representation, which means it's more expensive to send out over a power. It means you have to find different ways to compress it, that are different than what you can apply to binary signals. So there's a lot of different challenges associated with these different modalities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So also in terms of communication, you're limited by the amount of data you can send?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also because you're currently using the Bluetooth protocol, you have to batch stuff together? But you have to also do this, keeping the latency crazy low? Crazy low? Anything to say about the latency?<|eot_id|>"}

This is a very real possibility for a number of reasons. One is that they'll have access to the best technology to play video games effectively. The second is they have the time to do so.

We asked him about this, it was something I was super curious about. \"What does it feel like when you're modulating a click intention, or when you're trying to just move the cursor to the right?\" He said it moves before he is actually intending it to. Which is kind of a surreal thing, and something that I would love to experience myself one day, what is that like to have the thing just be so immediate, so fluid, that it feels like it's happening before you're actually intending it to move?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I suppose we've gotten used to that latency, that natural latency that happens. So is currently the bottleneck, the communication? So the Bluetooth communication? What's the actual bottleneck?

And as we push latency down to the level of individual spikes impacting control, that level of resolution, that kind of protocol is going to become a limiting factor at some scale. Another sort of important nuance to this, is that it's not just the Neuralink itself that's part of this equation. If you start pushing latency below the level of how fast you're going to refresh, then you have another problem.

I think there's probably a lot of folks listening that just have no clue what it means to decode brain activity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually, even if we zoom out beyond that, what is the app? So there's an implant that's wirelessly communicating with any digital device that has an app installed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe can you tell me at high-level what the app is, what the software is outside of the brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that give you more than just a course on average correct representation of what the user's intending to do.

You want it to be able to do exactly what the user's intending, at every step along the way, not just on average be correct, when you're trying to move it from left to right. And building a behavioral calibration game, or our software experience, that gives you that level of resolution, is what we spend a lot of time working on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the calibration process, the interface, has to encourage precision.

And calibration, at least at this stage of Neuralink is fundamental to the operation of the thing? And not just calibration, but continued calibration essentially?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>left, and given a dataset of neural spikes. Is there a way to infer, in some kind of semi-supervised, or entirely unsupervised way, what that high resolution version of their intention is? And if you think about it, there probably is, because there are enough data points in the dataset, enough constraints on your model. That there should be a way with the right sort of formulation, to let the model figure out itself, for example... At this millisecond, this is exactly how hard they're pushing upwards, and at this millisecond, this is how hard they're trying to push upwards.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's really important to have very clean labels, yes? So the problem becomes much harder from the machine learning perspective if the labels are noisy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then to get the clean labels, that's a UX challenge?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>cursor disappears, try to move that now invisible cursor, 200 pixels to the right. And the assumption in that case would be that the user can't actually modulate correctly that position offset. But that position offset assumption might be a weaker assumption, and therefore potentially, you can make it more accurate, than these heuristics that are trying to guesstimate at each millisecond what the user's trying to do. So you can imagine different tasks that make different assumptions about the nature of the user intention. And those assumptions being correct is what I would think of as a clean label.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For that step, what are we supposed to be visualizing? There's a cursor, and you want to move that cursor to the right, or the left, or up and down, or maybe move them by a certain offset. So that's one way. Is that the best way to do calibration? So for example, an alternative crazy way that probably is playing a role here, is a game like WEG Grid. Where you're just getting a very large amount of data, the person playing a game. Where if they're in a state of flow, maybe you can get clean signal as a side effect?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Or is that not an effective way for initial calibration?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>distribution, it didn't cover super well, and the user now figures out, because they're a brilliant user like Noland, they figure out the right sequence of imagined motions, or the right angle they have to hold their hand at to get it to work. And they'll get it to work great, but then the next day they come back to their device, and maybe they don't remember exactly all the tricks that they used the previous day. And so there's a complicated sort of feedback cycle here that can emerge, and can make it a very, very difficulty debugging process.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. There's a lot of really fascinating things there. Actually, just to stay on the closed loop... I've seen situations, this actually happened watching psychology grad students. They used a piece of software and they don't know how to program themselves. They used a piece of software that somebody else wrote, and it has a bunch of bugs, and they've been using it for years. They figure out ways to walk around, \"Oh, that just happens.\" Nobody considers, \"Maybe we should fix this.\" They just adapt. And that's a really interesting notion, that we're really good at it adapting, but that might not be the optimal?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So how do you solve that problem? Do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while, kind of thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what's going on in the brain, and what is the mouse exactly doing on the table? And it turns out that if you build the mapping from neurospikes to predict exactly what the mouse is doing, that model will perform worse, than a model that is trained to predict higher level assumptions about what the user might be trying to do. For example, assuming that the monkey is trying to go in a straight line to the target, it turns out that making those assumptions is actually more effective in producing a model, than actually predicting the underlying hand movement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the intention, not the physical movement, or whatever?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's obviously a really strong correlation between the two, but the intention is a more powerful thing to be chasing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's also super interesting. I mean, the intention itself is fascinating because yes, with the BCI here in this case with the digital telepathy, you're acting on the intention, not the action. Which is why there's an experience of feeling like it's happening before you meant for it to happen? That is so cool. And that is why you could achieve superhuman performance problem, in terms of the control of the mouse? So for open loop, just to clarify, so whenever the person is tasked to move the mouse to the right, you said there's not feedback, so they don't get to get that satisfaction of actually getting it to move? Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you imagined?\" And that could give the user some sort of feedback of how consistent are they, across different trials. You could also imagine that if the user is prompted with that kind of consistency metric, that maybe they just become more behaviorally engaged to begin with, because the task is kind of boring when you don't have any feedback at all. And so there may be benefits to the user experience of showing something on the screen, even if it's not accurate. Just because it keeps the user motivated to try to increase that number, or push it upwards.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's this psychology element here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And again, all of that is UX challenge? How much signal drift is there hour-to-hour, day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month? How often do you have to recalibrate because of the signal drift?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>software features that we provide to the user. For example, we let the user adjust exactly how fast the cursor is moving. We call that the gain, for example, the gain of how fast the cursor reacts to any given input intention. They can also adjust the smoothing, how smooth the output of that cursor intention actually is. That can also adjust the friction, which is how easy is it to stop and hold still? And all these software tools allow the user a great deal of flexibility and troubleshooting mechanisms to be able to solve this problem for themselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, all of this is done by looking to the right side of the screen, selecting the mixer. And the mixer you have, it's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Like DJ mode. DJ mode for your BCI.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, it's a really well done interface. It's really, really well done. And so there's that bias that there's a cursor drift that Noland talked about in a stream. Although he said that you guys were just playing around with it with him, and then constantly improving. So that could have been just a snapshot of that particular moment, a particular day, where he said that there was this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him. I guess, looking to the right side of the screen, or left side of the screen, to adjust the bias?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's one interface action, I guess, to adjust the bias?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is, it's very prioritized, very beautiful user experience. Where the user can essentially flash the cursor over to the side of the screen, and it opens up a window, where they can actually adjust or tune exactly the bias of the cursor. So bias, maybe for people who aren't familiar, is just sort of what is the default motion of the cursor, if you're imagining nothing? And it turns out that, that's one of the first sort- ... and it turns out that that's one of the first qualia of the cursor control experience that's impacted by neuron [inaudible 05:50:07]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Qualia of the cursor experience.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm not the guy moving thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's very poetic. I love it. The qualia of the cursor experience. Yeah, I mean it sounds poetic, but it is deeply true. There is an experience. When it works well, it is a joyful... A really pleasant experience. And when it doesn't work well, it's a very frustrating experience. That's actually the art of UX, you have the possibility to frustrate people, or the possibility to give them joy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and intuitive for the user to understand the state of the system, and how to achieve what they want to achieve. And ultimately the end goal is that that UX is completely... It fades in the background, it becomes something that's so natural and intuitive that it's subconscious to the user, and they just should feel like they have basically direct control over the cursor, just does what they want it to do. They're not thinking about the implementation of how to make it do what they want it to do, it's just doing what they want it to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some kind of things along the lines of like Fitt's Law, where you should move the mouse in a certain kind of way that maximizes your chance to hit the target? I don't even know what I'm asking, but I'm hoping the intention of my question will land on a profound answer. No. Is there some kind of understanding of the laws of UX when it comes to the context of somebody using their brain to control it that's different than with a mouse?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>neurons firing. And so you want to be very sure that that click is correct, because a false click can be very destructive to the user. They might accidentally close the tab that they're trying to do something in, and lose all their progress. They might accidentally hit some send button on some text that there's only half composed and reads funny after. So there's different sort of cost functions associated with errors in this space, and part of the UX design is understanding how to build a solution that is, when it's wrong, still useful to the end user.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so fascinating, assigning cost to every action when an error occurs. So every action, if an error occurs, has a certain cost, and incorporating that into how you interpret the intention, mapping it to the action is really important. I didn't quite, until you said it, realize there's a cost to sending the text early. It's a very expensive cost.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's super annoying if you accidentally... Imagine if your cursor misclicked every once in a while. That's super obnoxious. And the worst part of it is, usually when the user's trying to click, they're also holding still, because they're over the target they want to hit, and they're getting ready to click, which means that in the datasets that we build, on average is the case that sort of low speeds, or desire to hold still, is correlated with when the user's attempting to click.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow, that is really fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>much higher for it to become a useful thing for the user. And there's ways to solve this. I mean, you can sort of take the compound approach of, \"Well, let's take five seconds to click. Let's take a huge window of time, so we can be very confident about the answer.\" But again, world's best mouse. The world's best mouse doesn't take a second to click, or 500 milliseconds to click, it takes five milliseconds to click or less. And so if you're aiming for that kind of high bar, then you really want to solve the underlying problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe this is a good place to ask about how to measure performance, this whole bits per second. Can you explain what you mean by that? Maybe a good place to start is to talk about Webgrid as a game, as a good illustration of the measurement of performance.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>blue targets on the screen. I think there's a very interesting journey ahead to get us to that same level of 10 BPS performance. It's not the case that the tricks that got us from 4 to 6 BPS, and then 6 to 8 BPS are going to be the ones that get us from 8 to 10. And in my view, the core challenge here is really the labeling problem. It's how do you understand, at a very, very fine resolution, what the user's attempting to do? And I highly encourage folks in academia to work on this problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the journey with Noland on that quest of increasing the BPS on Webgrid? In March, you said that he selected 89,285 targets in Webgrid. So he loves this game, he's really serious about improving his performance in this game. So what is that journey of trying to figure out how to improve that performance? How much can that be done on the decoding side? How much can that be done on the calibration side? How much can that be done on the Noland side of figuring out how to convey his intention more cleanly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And this has evolved over time, so once we gave him the ability to calibrate models on his own, he was able to go and explore various different ways to imagine controlling the cursor.

He tried a whole bunch of stuff to explore the space of what is the most natural way for him to control the cursor, that at the same time, it's easy for us to decode-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to clarify, it's through the body mapping procedure there, you're able to figure out which finger he can move?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Yeah, that's one way to do it. Maybe one nuance of the... When he's doing it, he can imagine many more things than we represent in that visual on the screen. So we show him, sort of abstractly, \"Here's a cursor. You figure out what works the best for you.\" And we obviously have hints about what will work best from that body mapping procedure, of, \"We know that this particular action we can represent well.\" But it's really up to him to go and explore and figure out what works the best.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But at which point does he no longer visualize the movement of his body, and is just visualizing the movement of the cursor?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he was just controlling the cursor, so he wasn't imagining moving his hand anymore, he was just imagining... I don't know what it is, some abstract intention to move the cursor on the screen, and I cannot tell you what the difference between those two things are, I truly cannot. He's tried to explain it to me before, I cannot give a first-person account of what that's like. But the expletives that he uttered in that moment were enough to suggest that it was a very qualitatively different experience for him to just have direct neural control over a cursor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder if there's a way through UX to encourage a human being to discover that, because he discovered it... Like you said to me, that he's a pioneer. So he discovered that on his own through all of this, the process of trying to move the cursor with different kinds of intentions. But that is clearly a really powerful thing to arrive at, which is to let go of trying to control the fingers and the hand, and control the actual digital device with your mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right. UX is how it works.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>try this, he was just exploring how to use his device and figured it out himself.

Don't imagine explicit action.\" And from there, we should be able to hopefully understand how this is for somebody who has not experienced that before. Maybe that's the default mode of operation for them, you don't have to go through this intermediate phase of explicit motions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Or maybe if that naturally happens for people, you can just occasionally encourage them to allow themselves to move the cursor.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to continue exploring further. Again, thanks to Noland and the many hours he's put into this. And so even just that, help constraints, or the beam search of different approaches that we could explore really helps accelerate for the next person the set of things that we'll get to try on day one, how fast we hopefully get them to use for control, how fast we can enable them to use it independently, and to get value out of the system. So massive hats off to Noland and all the participants that came before to make this technology a reality.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how often are the updates to the decoder? 'Cause Noland mentioned, \"Okay, there's a new update that we're working on.\" In the stream he said he plays the snake game, because it's super hard, it's a good way for him to test how good the update is.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>little bit, I work with a lot of exceptional people, and it requires the team being absolutely laser-focused on the user, and what will be the best for them.

I have all these meetings, we're going to skip that today, and we're going to do this.\" That level of focus and commitment is, I would say, underappreciated in the world. And also, you obviously have to have the talent to be able to execute on these things effectively, and we have that in loads.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and this is such an interesting space of UX design, because there's so many unknowns here.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you'll be. As a good example, like in an RL simulation for example, the more frequently you get reward, the faster you can progress. It's just an easier learning problem the more frequently you get feedback. But UX is not that way, I mean, users are actually quite often wrong about what the right solution is, and it requires a deep understanding of the technical system, and what's possible, combined with what the problem is you're trying to solve. Not just how the user expressed it, but what the true underlying problem is to actually get to the right place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the old stories of Steve Jobs rolling in there, like, \"Yeah, the user is a useful signal, but it's not a perfect signal, and sometimes you have to remove the floppy disc drive.\" Or whatever the... I forgot all the crazy stories of Steve Jobs making wild design decisions. But there, some of it is aesthetic, that some of it is about the love you put into the design, which is very much a Steve Jobs, Johnny Ive type thing, but when you have a human being using their brain to interact with it, it also is deeply about function, it's not just aesthetic. And that, you have to empathize with a human being before you, while not always listening to them directly. You have to deeply empathize. It's fascinating. It's really, really fascinating.

What is the right sort of dynamic, or what's the right amount of page give, if you will, when you push it to make it flow the right amount for the user to have a natural experience reading their book?\" I could tell you there's so many little minutia of how exactly that scroll works, that we spent probably a month getting right, to make that feel extremely natural and easy for the user to navigate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, even the scroll on a smartphone with your finger feels extremely natural and pleasant, and it probably takes an extremely long time to get that right. And actually, the same kind of visionary UX design that we were talking about, don't always listen to the users, but also listen to them, and also have visionary, big, like throw everything out, think from first principles, but also not. Yeah, yeah. By the way, it just makes me think that scroll bars on the desktop probably have stagnated, and never taken that... 'Cause the snap, same as snap to grid, snap to scroll bar action you're talking about is something that could potentially be extremely useful in the desktop setting, even just for users to just improve the experience. 'Cause the current scroll bar experience in the desktop is horrible.<|eot_id|>"}

Agreed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's hard to find, hard to control, there's not a momentum, there's... And the intention should be clear, when I start moving towards a scroll bar, there should be a snapping to the scroll bar action, but of course... Maybe I'm okay paying that cost, but there's hundreds of millions of people paying that cost non-stop, but anyway. But in this case, this is necessary, because there's an extra cost paid by Noland for the jitteriness, so you have to switch between the scrolling and the reading. There has to be a face shift between the two, like when you're scrolling, you're scrolling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we do that with a feature called magnetic targets, we actually index the screen, and we understand, \"Okay, these are the places that are very small targets that might be difficult to hit.

I would guess it's below 40, but above 20, somewhere in there is probably the right... That I'd never to be thinking about. It also matters how difficult the task is. You can imagine some people might be able to do 10,000 targets on the screen, and maybe they can do better that way.

If you're trying to allow the user to express themselves through any given communication channel, you can measure that with bits per second. But what actually is measured at the end of the day is how effective are they at navigating their computer? So from the perspective of the downstream tasks that you care about, functionality and extending functionality is something we're very interested in, because not only can it improve the number of BPS, but it can also improve the downstream independence that the user has and the skill and efficiency with which they can operate their computer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would the number of threads increasing also potentially help?<|eot_id|>"}

You can imagine wiggling your big nose for opening some menu or wiggling your big toe to have command tab occur or something like this. So it's really the amount of different actions you can take in the world depends on how many channels you have on the information content that they carry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, so that's more about the number of actions.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can. And that last point is very related to channel account discussion. So as you scale out number of channels, the relative importance of any particular feature of your model input to the output control of the user diminishes, which means that if the neural non-stationarity effect is per channel, or if the noise is independent such that more channels means on average less output effect, then your reliability of your system will improve. So one core thesis that at least I have is that scaling channel account should improve the reliability system without any work on the decoder itself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you linger on the reliability here? So first of all, when you say non-stationarity of the signal, which aspect are you referring to?<|eot_id|>"}

There can be other effects, not linear effects on top of that, but at least at a very first order description of the problem. That's what we observed day to day is that the baseline firing rate of any particular neuron or observed on a particular channel is changing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you just adjust to the baseline to make it relative to the baseline nonstop?<|eot_id|>"}

There's still some artistry left to be uncovered here of how to get your model to scale with more compute, and that may be fundamentally a labeling problem, but there may be other components to this as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it data constraint at this time, which is what it sounds like?

Another good example was at one point he was trying to do a left click and drag, and the minute he started moving, the left click signal dropped off a cliff. So again, 'cause some contamination between the two signals, you need to come up with some way to either in the dataset or in the model build robustness against this kind of, you think of it like overfitting, but really it's just that the model has not seen this kind of variability before. So you need to find some way to help the model with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is super cool 'cause it feels like all of this is very solvable, but it's hard.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's because the information bottleneck of language is pretty steep, and yet you're able to reconstruct on the other person's brain more effectively without being literal. If you can express a sentiment such that in their brain they can reconstruct the actual true underlying meaning and beauty of the thing that you're trying to get across, the generator function in their brain is more powerful than what language can express. And so the mechanism of poetry is really just to feed or seed that generator function.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So being literal sometimes is a suboptimal compression for the thing you're trying to convey.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That right. And it's actually in the process of the user going through that generation that they understand what you mean.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's actually going to be relevant for full-on telepathy. It's like if you just read the poetry literally, that doesn't say much of anything interesting. It requires a human to interpret it. So it's the combination of the human mind and all the experiences that a human being has within the context of the collective intelligence of the human species that makes that poem make sense and they load that in. So in that same way, the signal that carries from human to human meaning may seem trivial, but may actually carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind and the receiving end. Yeah, that's interesting. Who was it? I think Joscha Bach [inaudible 06:45:24] said something about all the people that think we've achieved AGI explain why humans like music.<|eot_id|>"}

And that's even true through history as musicians evolve in music, they take some known structure that people are familiar with and they just tweak it a little bit. They tweak it and add a surprising element. This is especially true in classical music heritage, but that's what I'm wondering.

And then when the two-year mark hit, so June 30, 2018, I was really sad that that's where I was, and then just randomly here and there, but I was never depressed for long periods of time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pretty easy for me. It's something that at the very beginning, after my accident, they told me to try and move my body as much as possible.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I know. It's bizarre.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's part of the recovery process is to keep trying to move your body.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. Every day as much as you can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the nervous system does its thing. It starts reconnecting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people at the time when I was in the hospital came in and told me for one guy who had recovered most of his control, what he thought about every day was actually walking, like the act of walking just over and over again. So I tried that for years. I tried just imagining walking, which is, it's hard. It's hard to imagine all of the steps that go into, well, taking a step. All of the things that have to move, all of the activations that have to happen along your leg in order for one step to occur.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you're not just imagining, you're doing it, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm trying. Yeah. So it's imagining over again what I had to do to take a step, because it's not something any of us think about. We just, you want to walk and you take a step. You don't think about all of the different things that are going on in your body. So I had to recreate that in my head as much as I could, and then I practice it over, and over, and over again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's not like a third person perspective, it's a first person perspective. It's not like you're imagining yourself walking. You're literally doing everything, all the same stuff as if you're walking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, which was hard. It was hard at the beginning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Frustrating hard, or actually cognitively hard, which way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a body part or think about a body part and move for two, three, four, sometimes eight hours, it's very taxing on your mind.

So for the first few years, a lot of what I was doing was staring at walls. And so, obviously I did a lot of thinking and I tried to move a lot just over, and over, and over again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you never gave up hope there?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And I still do it. I do it subconsciously, and I think that that helped a lot with things with Neuralink, honestly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But yeah, I was talking about how a lot of what they've had me do, especially at the beginning, well, I still do it now, is body mapping.

And so it made things very seamless for me I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really, really cool. So it's amazing to know. I've learned a lot about the body mapping procedure with the interface and everything like that. It's cool to know that you've been essentially training to be world-class at that task.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people say, \"Don't give up.\" I think one girl had spoken to me through some family members and said that she had been paralyzed for 18 years, and she'd been trying to wiggle her index finger for all that time, and she finally got it back 18 years later. So I know that it's possible, and I'll never give up doing it. I do it when I'm lying down watching TV. I'll find myself doing it just almost on its own. It's just something I've gotten so used to doing that I don't know. I don't think I'll ever stop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really awesome to hear. I think it's one of those things that can really pay off in the long term. It is training.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I knew. I wasn't getting back any mobility or sensation or anything. So I could have been running up against a brick wall for all I knew. And with Neuralink, I get to see all the signals happening real time, and I get to see that what I'm doing can actually be mapped. When we started doing click calibrations and stuff, when I go to click my index finger for a left click, that it actually recognizes that. It changed how I think about what's possible with retraining my body to move. And so yeah, I'll never give up now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also just the signal that there's still a powerhouse of a brain there that's like, and as the technology develops, that brain is, I mean, that's the most important thing about the human body is the brain, and it can do a lot of the control. So what did it feel like when you first could wiggle the index finger and saw the environment respond? That little thing, whatever [inaudible 07:22:49] just being way too dramatic according to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>point. I hadn't interacted with a computer or anything at that point. So it just made sense. It was cool. I didn't really know much about BCI at that point either, so I didn't know what sort of step this was actually making. I didn't know if this was a huge deal, or if this was just like, \"Okay, this is, it's cool that we got this far, but we're actually hoping for something much better down the road.\" It's like, \"Okay.\" I just thought that they knew that it turned on. So I was like, \"Cool, this is cool.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, did you read up on the specs of the hardware you get installed, the number of threads, all this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I knew all of that, but it's all Greek to me. I was like, \"Okay, 64 threads, 16 electrodes, 1,024 channels. Okay, that math checks out.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sounds right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When was the first time you were able to move a mouse cursor?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>still signals in my brain firing. They just can't get through because there's a gap in my spinal cord, and so they can't get all the way down and back up, but they're still there.\" So when I moved the cursor for the first time, I was like, \"That's cool, but I expected that that should happen.\" It made sense to me. When I moved the cursor for the first time with just my mind, without physically trying to move. So I guess I can get into that just a little bit. The difference between attempted movement, and imagine movement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's a fascinating difference [inaudible 07:26:18] from one to the other.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to imagine something versus attempting it, there wasn't a lot that I could do there mentally. I just kind of had to accept what was going on and try. But the attempted moving thing, it all made sense to me. If I try to move, then there's a signal being sent in my brain, and as long as they can pick that up, then they should be able to map it to what I'm trying to do. And so when I first moved the cursor like that, it was just like, \"Yes, this should happen. I'm not surprised by that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But can you clarify, is there supposed to be a difference between imagine movement and attempted movement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just that in imagine movement, you're not attempting to move at all. So it's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're visualizing what you're doing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Visualizing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... And then theoretically, is that supposed to be a different part of the brain that lights up in those two different situations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, not necessarily. I think all these signals can still be represented in motor cortex, but the difference I think, has to do with the naturalness of imagining something versus-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Got it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... attempting it. The fatigue of that over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And by the way, on the mic is Bliss. So this is just different ways to prompt you to kind of get to the thing that you arrived at.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Attempted movement does sound like the right thing. Try.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, it makes sense to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because imagine, for me, I would start visualizing, in my mind, visualizing. Attempted I would actually start trying to... I did combat sports my whole life, like wrestling. When I'm imagining a move, see, I'm moving my muscle.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is a bit of an activation almost versus visualizing yourself, like a picture doing it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's something that I feel like naturally anyone would do. If you try to tell someone to imagine doing something, they might close their eyes and then start physically doing it, but it just-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just didn't click.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Yeah, it's hard. It was very hard at the beginning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But attempted worked.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is it really with my mind. I'm attempting to move and it's just picking that up so it doesn't feel like it's with my mind.\" But when I moved it for the first time like that, it was, oh man. It made me think that this technology, that what I'm doing is actually way, way more impressive than I ever thought. It was way cooler than I ever thought, and it just opened up a whole new world of possibilities of what could possibly happen with this technology and what I might be able to be capable of with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because you had felt for the first time like this was digital telepathy. You're controlling a digital device with your mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's a real moment of discovery. That's really cool. You've discovered something. I've seen scientists talk about a big aha moment, like Nobel Prize winning. They'll have this like, \"Holy crap.\" Like, \"Whoa.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the other. I can just completely think about whatever I'm doing, but I don't know, I like to play around with it. I also like to just experiment with these things. Every now and again, I'll get this idea in my head, I wonder if this works and I'll just start doing it, and then afterwards I'll tell them, \"By the way, I wasn't doing that like you guys wanted me to. I thought of something and I wanted to try it and so I did. It seems like it works, so maybe we should explore that a little bit.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I think that discovery's not just for you, at least from my perspective. That's a discovery for everyone else who ever uses a Neuralink that this is possible. I don't think that's an obvious thing that this is even possible. It's like I was saying to Bliss earlier, it's like the four-minute mile. People thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes and once the first person did it, then everyone just started doing it. So just to show that it's possible, that paves the way to anyone can now do it. That's the thing that's actually possible. You don't need to do the attempted movement, you can just go direct.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's crazy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is crazy. It is crazy, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For people who don't know, can you explain how the Link app works? You have an amazing stream on the topic. Your first stream, I think, on X describing, the app. Can you just describe how it works?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>do on it. So there's the body mapping, which we kind of touched on. There's a calibration. Calibration is how I actually get cursor control, so calibrating what's going on in my brain to translate that into cursor control. So it will pop out models. What they use, I think, is time. So it would be five minutes and calibration will give me so good of a model, and then if I'm in it for 10 minutes and 15 minutes, the models will progressively get better. And so the longer I'm in it, generally, the better the models will get.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really cool because you often refer to the models. So the model's the thing that's constructed once you go through the calibration step.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you also talked about sometimes you'll play a really difficult game like Snake just to see how good the model is.<|eot_id|>"}

I think there's a setting to wake it up every so long, so we could set it to half an hour, or five hours, or something, if I just want it to wake up periodically. So yeah, I'll connect to the Link app and then go through all sorts of things, calibration for the day, maybe body mapping. I made them give me a little homework tab because I am very forgetful and I forget to do things a lot. So I have a lot of data collection things that they want me to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is the body mapping part of the data collection or is that also part of the calibration?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it is. It's something that they want me to do daily, which I've been slacking on because I've been doing so much media and traveling so much. So I've been [inaudible 07:39:30]-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've gotten super famous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've been a terrible first candidate for how much I've been slacking on my homework. But yeah, it's just something that they want me to do every day to track how well the Neuralink is performing over time and to have something to give, I imagine, to give to the FDA to create all sorts of fancy charts and stuff, and show like, hey, this is what the Neuralink... This is how it's performing day one, versus day 90, versus day 180, and things like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the calibration step like? Is it move left, move right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a bubble game. So there will be yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen. At first, it is open loop. So open loop, this is something that I still don't fully understand, the open loop and closed loop thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The me and Bliss talked for a long time about the difference between the two on the technical side.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it'd be great to hear your-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, so open-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... your side of the story.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as I'm doing this. There are a couple of different ways that they've done it. They call it center-out targets. So there will be a bubble in the middle and then eight bubbles around that, and the cursor will go from the middle to one side. So say, middle to left, back to middle, to up, to middle, up, right, and they'll do that all the way around the circle. And I will follow that cursor the whole time, and then it will train off of my intentions, what it is expecting my intentions to be throughout the whole process.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you actually speak to, when you say follow-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... you don't mean with your eyes, you mean with your intentions?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so generally for calibration, I'm doing attempted movements because I think it works better. I think the better models, as I progress through calibration, make it easier to use imagined movements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait. Wait, wait, wait. So calibrated on attempted movement will create a model that makes it really effective for you to then use the force.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>15 minutes, I can't use imagined movement. It just doesn't work for some reason. And after a certain point, I can just feel it, I can tell. It moves different. That's the best way I can describe it. It's almost as if it is anticipating what I am going to do again, before I go to do it. And so using attempted movement for 15 minutes, at some point, I can tell when I move my eyes to the next target that the cursor is starting to pick up. It's starting to understand, it's learning what I'm going to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So first of all, it's really cool that, you are a true pioneer in all of this. You're exploring how to do every aspect of this most effectively and there's just, I imagine, so many lessons learned from this. So thank you for being a pioneer in all these kinds of different super technical ways. And it's also cool to hear that there's a different feeling to the experience when it's calibrated in different ways because I imagine your brain is doing something different and that's why there's a different feeling to it. And then trying to find the words and the measurements to those feelings would be also interesting. But at the end of the day, you can also measure your actual performance, on whether it's Snake or Webgrid, you could see what actually works well. And you're saying, for the open loop calibration, the attempted movement works best for now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the open loop, you don't get the feedback that you did something.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I just-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that frustrating? [inaudible 07:44:43]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We've done it with a cursor and without a cursor in open loop. So sometimes it's just, say for the center out, you'll start calibration with a bubble lighting up and I push towards that bubble, and then when it's pushed towards that bubble for, say, three seconds, a bubble will pop and then I come back to the middle. So I'm doing it all just by my intentions. That's what it's learning anyway. So it makes sense that as long as I follow what they want me to do, follow the yellow brick road, that it'll all work out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're full of great references. Is the bubble game fun?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we're about to do a 40-minute calibration. I'm like, \"All right, do you guys want to do two of them?\" I'm always asking to... Whatever they need, I'm more than happy to do. And it's not bad. I get to lie there or sit in my chair and do these things with some great people. I get to have great conversations. I can give them feedback. I can talk about all sorts of things. I could throw something on, on my TV in the background, and split my attention between them. It's not bad at all. I don't mind it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a score that you get?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you do better on a bubble game?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I really enjoy striving for, is towards the end of calibration, there is a time between targets. And so I like to keep, at the end, that number as low as possible. So at the beginning it can be four or five, six seconds between me popping bubbles, but towards the end I like to keep it below 1.5 or if I could get it to one second between bubbles. Because in my mind, that translates really nicely to something like Webgrid, where I know if I can hit a target, one every second, that I'm doing real, real well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There you go. That's a way to get a score on the calibrations, like the speed. How quickly can you get from bubble to bubble?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's the open loop and then it goes to the closed loop.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Closed loop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the closed loop can already start giving you a sense because you're getting feedback of how good the model is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. So closed loop is when I first get cursor control, and how they've described it to me, someone who does not understand this stuff, I am the dumbest person in the room every time I'm with any of those guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love the humility. I appreciate it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, is that I am closing the loop. So I am actually now the one that is finishing the loop of whatever this loop is. I don't even know what the loop is. They've never told me. They just say there is a loop and at one point it's open and I can't control, and then I get control and it's closed. So I'm finishing the loop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how long the calibration usually take? You said 10, 15 minutes, [inaudible 07:48:52]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it down seven minutes or below, at least where we're at right now. It'd be nice if you never had to do calibration. So we'll get there at some point, I'm sure, the more we learn about the brain, and I think that's the dream. I think right now, for me to get really, really good models, I'm in calibration 40 or 45 minutes. And I don't mind, like I said, they always feel really bad, but if it's going to get me a model that can break these records on Webgrid, I'll stay in it for flipping two hours.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's talk business. So Webgrid, I saw a presentation where Bliss said by March you selected 89,000 targets in Webgrid. Can you explain this game? What is Webgrid and what does it take to be a world-class performer in Webgrid, as you continue to break world records?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's like a gold medalist talk. Well, where do I begin?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I'd like thank-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Webgrid is a-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... grid of cells.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's literally just a grid. They can make it as big or small as you can make a grid. A single box on that grid will light up and you go and click it. And it is a way for them to benchmark how good a BCI is. So it's pretty straightforward. You just click targets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Only one blue cell appears and you're supposed to move the mouse to there and click on it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. So I like playing on bigger grids because the bigger the grid, the more BPS, it's bits per second, that you get every time you click one. So I'll say I'll play on a 35 by 35 grid, and then one of those little squares, a cell, you can call it, target, whatever, will light up. And you move the cursor there, and you click it, and then you do that forever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you've been able to achieve, at first, eight bits per second, then you've recently broke that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But I had a, I don't know, a five-second lag right at the end, and I just had to wait until the latency calmed down, and then I kept clicking. But I was at 8.01, and then five seconds of lag, and then the next three targets I clicked all stayed at 8.01. So if I would've been able to click during that time of lag, I probably would've hit, I don't know, I might've hit nine. So I'm there. I'm really close, and then this whole Austin trip has really gotten in the way of my Webgrid playing ability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's frustrating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's all-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I know. I just want to do better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At nine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I want to do better. I want to hit nine, I think, well, I know nine is very, very achievable. I'm right there. I think 10 I could hit, maybe in the next month. I could do it probably in the next few weeks if I really push.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think you and Elon are basically the same person because last time I did a podcast with him, he came in extremely frustrated that he can't beat Uber Lilith as a Druid.<|eot_id|>"}

He stayed up and did it that night, which is crazy to me. In a fundamental way, it's really inspiring and what you're doing is inspiring in that way because it's not just about the game. Everything you're doing there has impact. By striving to do well on Webgrid, you're helping everybody figure out how to create the system all along the decoding, the software, the hardware, the calibration, all of it. How to make all of that work so you can do everything else really well.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Noland, the first time Noland played this game, he asked how good are we at this game?

I think- I'm excited for that. Yeah. So I've been playing, first off, with the dwell cursor, which really hampers my Webgrid playing ability. Basically I have to wait 0.3 seconds for every click.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, so you can't do the click. So you click by dwelling, you said 0.3.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>able to get. I still hit 50, I think I hit 50-something net trials per minute in that, which was pretty good because I'm able to... One of the settings is also how slow you need to be moving in order to initiate a click, to start a click. So I can tell, sort of, when I'm on that threshold, to start initiating a click just a bit early. So I'm not fully stopped over the target when I go to click, I'm doing it on my way to the targets a little, to try to time it just right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're slowing down.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just a hair, right before the targets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is like elite performance. Okay, but that's still, it sucks that there's a ceiling of the 0.3.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I can get down to 0.2 and 0.1. 0.1's what I've-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 07:55:45].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So if I play Webgrid for 10 minutes, they can train off that data specifically in order to get me a better model. If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1, the models come out different. The way that they interact, it's just much, much different. So I have to be really careful. I found that doing it with 0.3 is actually better in some ways. Unless I can do it with 0.1 and change all of the different parameters, then that's more ideal, because obviously 0.3 is faster than 0.1. So I could get there. I can get there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you click using your brain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For right now, it's the hover clicking with the dwell cursor. Before all the thread retraction stuff happened, we were calibrating clicks, left click, right click. That was my previous ceiling, before I broke the record again with the dwell cursor, was I think on a 35 by 35 grid with left and right click. And you get more BPS, more bits per second, using multiple clicks because it's more difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, because what is it, you're supposed to do either a left click or a right click?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is a different colors, something like this?<|eot_id|>"}

Like I said, I'm just kind of person, I roll with the punches anyway. So-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the process? What was the feedback loop on the figuring out how to do the spike detection in a way that would actually work well for Noland?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what we care about ultimately is that you can use it independently to do whatever you want. And to get to that point, it required us to re-engineer the UX, as you talked about with the dwell cursor, to make it something that you can use independently without us needing to be involved all the time. And yeah, this is obviously the start of this journey still. Hopefully we get back to the places where you're doing multiple clicks and using that to control, much more fluidly, everything, and much more naturally the applications that you're trying to interface with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And most importantly, get that Webgrid number up.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I have to continuously keep it moving, basically. So like I said, there's a threshold where it will initiate a click.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And if I don't want it to ever get there, I just keep it moving at a certain speed and just constantly doing circles on screen, moving it back and forth, to keep it from clicking stuff. I actually noticed, a couple weeks back, that when I was not using the implant, I was just moving my hand back and forth or in circles. I was trying to keep the cursor from clicking and I was just doing it while I was trying to go to sleep. And I was like, \"Okay, this is a problem.\" [inaudible 08:05:52]. [inaudible 08:05:51].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To avoid the clicking. I guess, does that create problems when you're gaming, accidentally click a thing? Like-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've lost a number of games because I'll accidentally click something.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said the app improved a lot from version one when you first started using it. It was very different.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then they take that feedback and they usually create amazing things for me. They solve these problems in ways I would've never imagined. They're so good at everything they do, and so I'm just really thankful that I'm able to give them feedback and they can make something of it, because a lot of my feedback is really dumb. It's just like, \"I want this, please do something about it,\" and it'll come back, super well-thought-out, and it's way better than anything I could have ever thought of or implemented myself. So they're just great. They're really, really cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As the BCI community grows, would you like to hang out with the other folks with Neuralinks?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So BPS is a log of number of targets times correct minus incorrect, divided by time.

That always gives me hope, is just realizing that there are people out there who still care and who want to help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And thank you for being one such human being and continuing to be a great human being through everything you've been through and being an inspiration to many people, to myself, for many reasons, including your epic, unbelievably great performance on Webgrid. I'll be training all night tonight to try to catch up.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks. Thanks, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nolan Arbaugh, and before that, with Elon Musk, DJ Seo, Matthew McDougall, and Bliss Chapman. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception. \"We live together. We act on and react to one another. But always, and in all circumstances, we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena. They are crucified alone. Embrace the lovers desperately tried to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence in vain. But it's very nature, every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy its solitude, sensations, feelings, insights, fancies, all these are private, and except through symbols and a secondhand incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
