Elon, DJ, Matthew and Bliss are of course part of the amazing Neuralink team, and Noland is the first human to have a Neuralink device implanted in his brain. I speak with each of them individually, so use timestamps to jump around, or as I recommend, go hardcore, and listen to the whole thing. This is the longest podcast I've ever done. It's a fascinating, super technical, and wide-ranging conversation, and I loved every minute of it. And now, dear friends, here's Elon Musk, his fifth time on this, the Lex Fridman podcast,<|eot_id|>"}

Putting a Neuralink implant in the first human being, Noland. And there's been a lot to talk about there about his experience because he's able to describe all the nuance and the beauty and the fascinating complexity of that experience of everything involved. But on the technical level, how does Neuralink work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and then convert it to a set of outputs that allows our first participant, Noland, to be able to control a cursor on the screen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And this is done wirelessly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to send that or not send that through Bluetooth to an external device, whether it's a phone or a computer that's running this Neuralink application.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's onboard signal processing already just to decide whether this is an interesting event or not.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>model to decode, okay, based on these spiking inputs, did Noland wish to go up, down, left, right, or click or right click or whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of this is really fascinating, but let's stick on the N1 Implant itself. So the thing that's in the brain. So I'm looking at a picture of it, there's an enclosure, there's a charging coil, so we didn't talk about the charging, which is fascinating. The battery, the power electronics, the antenna. Then there's the signal processing electronics. I wonder if there's more kinds of signal processing you can do? That's another question. And then there's the threads themselves with the enclosure on the bottom. So maybe to ask about the charging. So there's an external charging device?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>three millimeters that's obviously transitioning off of the top of the implant to where the screws are. And that's the minor bump that you have.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those threads look tiny. That's incredible. That is really incredible. That is really incredible. And also, you're right, most of the actual volume is the battery. This is way smaller than I realized.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Also, the threads themselves are quite strong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They look strong.<|eot_id|>"}

So what's the width of a thread?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thread starts from 16 micron and then tapers out to about 84 micron.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what it does, is that it actually concentrate that field line away from the battery and then around the coil that's actually wrapped around it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of really fascinating design here to make it, I mean, you're integrating a computer into a biological, a complex biological system.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is fascinating. So you mentioned optics. So there's a robot, R1, so for now, there's a human that actually creates a hole in the skull. And then after that, there's a computer vision component that's finding a way to avoid the blood vessels. And then you're grabbing it by the loop, each individual thread, and placing it in a particular location to avoid the blood vessels and also choosing the depth of placement, all that. So controlling every, the 3D geometry, of the placement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>from major vessels that you see. But we want to get to a point where one click and it just does the surgery within minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the computer vision component finds great targets, candidates, and the human approves them, and the robot does...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to make sure that it got inserted. If so, how deep? Did it actually match what was programmed in?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so there's some reasoning behind that, as you mentioned, it gets more varied signal.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>16 electrodes that we currently have in this version, spans roughly around three millimeters. So we want to get all of those in the brain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is fascinating. Okay, so there's a million questions here. If we could zoom in specifically on the electrodes. What is your sense, how many neurons is each individual electrode listening to?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we only see about at most two to three, and you can actually distinguish which neuron it's coming from by the shape of the spikes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mentioned the spike detection algorithm that we have, it's called BOSS algorithm, Buffer Online Spike Sorter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>spike?\" And then based on that, you could also determine, \"Oh, that spike looks different than that spike, it must come from a different neuron.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So that's a nice signal processing step from which you can then make much better predictions about if there's a spike, especially in this kind of context, where there could be multiple neurons screaming.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, that's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>then you run a bunch of different set of algorithms to tease apart, it's just all of this for us is done on the device.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the device.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In a very low power, custom-built ASIC digital processing unit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Highly heat constrained.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>processing time from signal going in and giving you the output is less than a microsecond, which is a very, very short amount of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow. Oh, that's a pain in the ass. That's really tough.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the biggest source of latency comes from the Bluetooth, the way in which their packetized and we bin them in a 15 millisecond time window.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, interesting, so it's communication constrained.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Nx, Rx.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the communication protocol because Bluetooth allows you to communicate, gets farther distances than you need to, so you can go much shorter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The only, well, the primary motivation for choosing Bluetooth is that, I mean, everything has Bluetooth,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, so you can talk to any device.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just absolutely essential, especially in this early phase. And in many ways, if you can access a phone or a computer, you can do anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It'll be interesting to step back and actually look at, again, the same pipeline that you mentioned for Noland. What does this whole process look like from finding and selecting a human being, to the surgery, to the first time he's able to use this thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of our engagement and what we're looking for during BCI home audit is to just understand their situation, what other assisted technology that they use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we should also step back and say that the estimate is 180,000 people live with quadriplegia in the United States, and each year an additional 18,000 suffer a paralyzing spinal cord injury. So these are folks who have a lot of challenges living a life in terms of accessibility, in terms of doing the things that many of us just take for granted day to day. And one of the things, one of the goals of this initial study is to enable them to have digital autonomy where they by themselves can interact with a digital device using just their mind, something that you're calling telepathy, so digital telepathy. Where a quadriplegic can communicate with a digital device in all the ways that we've been talking about. Control the mouse cursor enough to be able to do all kinds of stuff, including play games and tweet and all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of people for whom life, the basics of life, are difficult because of the things that have happened to them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but from a ALS, MS, or even stroke, or just aging, that leads you to lose some of that mobility, that independence, it's extremely debilitating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And all of these are opportunities to help people, to help alleviate suffering, to help improve the quality of life. But each of the things you mentioned is its own little puzzle that needs to have increasing levels of capability from a device like a Neuralink device. And so the first one you're focusing on is, it's just a beautiful word, telepathy. So being able to communicate using your mind wirelessly with a digital device. Can you just explain exactly what we're talking about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just definitionally being able to transfer information from my brain to your brain without using some of the physical faculties that we have, like voices.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the interesting thing here is I think the thing that's not obviously clear is how exactly it works. In order to move a cursor, there's at least a couple of ways of doing that. One is you imagine yourself maybe moving a mouse with your hand, or you can then, which no one talked about, imagine moving the cursor with your mind. But it's like there is a cognitive step here that's fascinating, because you have to use the brain and you have to learn how to use the brain, and you have to figure it out dynamically because you reward yourself if it works. I mean, there's a step that ... This is just a fascinating step because you have to get the brain to start firing in the right way. And you do that by imagining ... Like fake it till you make it. And all of a sudden it creates the right kind of signal that, if decoded correctly, can create the effect. And then there's noise around that that you have to figure all of that out. But on the human side, imagine the cursor moving is what you have to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. He says using the force.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The force.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>model's constantly updating the way to say, \"Oh, if someone is thinking about this sophisticated forms of spiking patterns, that actually means to do this.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the machine is learning about the human and the human is learning about the machine, so there is a adaptability to the signal process and the decoding step, and then there's the adaptation of Nolan, the human being. The same way, if you give me a new mouse and I move it, I learn very quickly about its sensitivity, so I learn to move it slower. And then there's other signal drift and all that kind of stuff they have to adapt to, so both are adapting to each other.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a fascinating software challenge, on both sides. The software on both, on the human software and the [inaudible 02:30:41] software.<|eot_id|>"}

Sorry to rudely interrupt. So there's the selection that Noland has passed with flying colors. Everything, including that it is a BCI-friendly home, all of that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>protect the thread as well as the brain.

What was the recovery like, and when was the first time he was able to use it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>modulate. And what I mean by modulate is that he can think about clenching his fist and you could see the spike disappear and appear.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's awesome.<|eot_id|>"}

And then maybe expand the realm of the possible for the human mind for millions of people in the future. So it's really exciting. The opportunities are all ahead of us, and to do that safely and to do that effectively was really fun to see.

You develop in that same kind of way. To me, it's just really fascinating to be able to even to play with that, honestly, I would get a Neuralink just to be able to play with that, just to play with the capacity, the capability of my mind to learn this skill.

Probably unknown to the degree to which you can do that, but you're now connecting an external thing to it, especially once it's doing stimulation. The biological brain and the electronic brain outside of it working together, the possibilities there are really interesting. It's still unknown, but interesting.

You live life like it's not going to end. And the fact that this light that's shining, this consciousness is going to no longer be in one moment, maybe today. It fills me when I really am able to load all that in with Ernest Becker's terror. It is a real fear. I think people aren't always honest with how terrifying it is. I think the more you are able to really think through it, the more terrifying it is. It's not such a simple thing, \"Oh, well, it's the way life is.\" If you really can load that in, it's hard, but I think that's why the Stoics did it, because it helps you get your shit together and be like, \"The moment, every single moment you're alive is just beautiful\" and it's terrifying that it's going to end, and it's almost like you're shivering in the cold, a child helpless. This kind of feeling, And then it makes you, when you have warmth, when you have the safety, when you have the love to really appreciate it. I feel like sometimes in your position when you mentioned armor just to see death, it might make you not be able to see that, the finiteness of life because if you kept looking at that, it might break you. So it is good to know that you're kind of still struggling with that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then to get the clean labels, that's a UX challenge?<|eot_id|>"}

And those assumptions being correct is what I would think of as a clean label.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For that step, what are we supposed to be visualizing? There's a cursor, and you want to move that cursor to the right, or the left, or up and down, or maybe move them by a certain offset. So that's one way. Is that the best way to do calibration? So for example, an alternative crazy way that probably is playing a role here, is a game like WEG Grid. Where you're just getting a very large amount of data, the person playing a game. Where if they're in a state of flow, maybe you can get clean signal as a side effect?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Or is that not an effective way for initial calibration?<|eot_id|>"}

There's a lot of really fascinating things there. Actually, just to stay on the closed loop... I've seen situations, this actually happened watching psychology grad students. They used a piece of software and they don't know how to program themselves. They used a piece of software that somebody else wrote, and it has a bunch of bugs, and they've been using it for years. They figure out ways to walk around, \"Oh, that just happens.\" Nobody considers, \"Maybe we should fix this.\" They just adapt. And that's a really interesting notion, that we're really good at it adapting, but that might not be the optimal?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So how do you solve that problem? Do you have to restart from scratch every once in a while, kind of thing?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's obviously a really strong correlation between the two, but the intention is a more powerful thing to be chasing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's also super interesting. I mean, the intention itself is fascinating because yes, with the BCI here in this case with the digital telepathy, you're acting on the intention, not the action. Which is why there's an experience of feeling like it's happening before you meant for it to happen? That is so cool. And that is why you could achieve superhuman performance problem, in terms of the control of the mouse? So for open loop, just to clarify, so whenever the person is tasked to move the mouse to the right, you said there's not feedback, so they don't get to get that satisfaction of actually getting it to move? Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on the screen, even if it's not accurate.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And again, all of that is UX challenge?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And all these software tools allow the user a great deal of flexibility and troubleshooting mechanisms to be able to solve this problem for themselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, all of this is done by looking to the right side of the screen, selecting the mixer.

It's really, really well done. And so there's that bias that there's a cursor drift that Noland talked about in a stream. Although he said that you guys were just playing around with it with him, and then constantly improving. So that could have been just a snapshot of that particular moment, a particular day, where he said that there was this cursor drift and this bias that could be removed by him.

Yeah, I mean it sounds poetic, but it is deeply true. There is an experience. When it works well, it is a joyful... A really pleasant experience.

So every action, if an error occurs, has a certain cost, and incorporating that into how you interpret the intention, mapping it to the action is really important.

But there, some of it is aesthetic, that some of it is about the love you put into the design, which is very much a Steve Jobs, Johnny Ive type thing, but when you have a human being using their brain to interact with it, it also is deeply about function, it's not just aesthetic. And that, you have to empathize with a human being before you, while not always listening to them directly. You have to deeply empathize. It's fascinating. It's really, really fascinating.

Yeah, yeah. By the way, it just makes me think that scroll bars on the desktop probably have stagnated, and never taken that... 'Cause the snap, same as snap to grid, snap to scroll bar action you're talking about is something that could potentially be extremely useful in the desktop setting, even just for users to just improve the experience.

Maybe I'm okay paying that cost, but there's hundreds of millions of people paying that cost non-stop, but anyway.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the amount of different actions you can take in the world depends on how many channels you have on the information content that they carry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, so that's more about the number of actions.

So first of all, when you say non-stationarity of the signal, which aspect are you referring to?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's what we observed day to day is that the baseline firing rate of any particular neuron or observed on a particular channel is changing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you just adjust to the baseline to make it relative to the baseline nonstop?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think it's data quality constrained, not necessarily data quantity constrained.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But even just the quantity 'cause it has to be trained on the interactions.

It feels like this would be one of those silly notions in the future where obviously you should have millions of electrodes and this is where the true breakthroughs happen.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's actually going to be relevant for full-on telepathy. It's like if you just read the poetry literally, that doesn't say much of anything interesting. It requires a human to interpret it. So it's the combination of the human mind and all the experiences that a human being has within the context of the collective intelligence of the human species that makes that poem make sense and they load that in. So in that same way, the signal that carries from human to human meaning may seem trivial, but may actually carry a lot of power because of the complexity of the human mind and the receiving end. Yeah, that's interesting. Who was it? I think Joscha Bach [inaudible 06:45:24] said something about all the people that think we've achieved AGI explain why humans like music.<|eot_id|>"}

That's a discovery for everyone else who ever uses a Neuralink that this is possible. I don't think that's an obvious thing that this is even possible. It's like I was saying to Bliss earlier, it's like the four-minute mile. People thought it was impossible to run a mile in four minutes and once the first person did it, then everyone just started doing it.

And it's also cool to hear that there's a different feeling to the experience when it's calibrated in different ways because I imagine your brain is doing something different and that's why there's a different feeling to it. And then trying to find the words and the measurements to those feelings would be also interesting.

To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception. \"We live together. We act on and react to one another. But always, and in all circumstances, we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena. They are crucified alone. Embrace the lovers desperately tried to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence in vain. But it's very nature, every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy its solitude, sensations, feelings, insights, fancies, all these are private, and except through symbols and a secondhand incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
