{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I am standing on the edge of the cliff the entire night, and if I mess something up, mess it up, what even is a mistake? But if I do a little clunker or whatever it is, it's like, so what? I wouldn't have played half the stuff that I'm playing if I wasn't constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why stand at the edge of the cliff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld, a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist, and a true musician who has recorded and performed with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck, Prince, Eric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger, Jackson Brown, Rod Stewart, David Gilmore, Pharrell, Hans Zimmer, and many, many more. This was a fun and fascinating conversation. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear, dear friends, here's Tal Wilkenfeld. There's a legendary video of you playing with Jeff Beck. We're actually watching it in the background now. So for people who don't know, Jeff is one of the greatest guitarists ever. So you're playing with him at the 2007 Crossroads Festival, and people should definitely watch that video. You were killing it on the bass. Look at that face. Were you scared? What was that experience like? Were you nervous? You don't look nervous. Confident?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this was a guitar festival. It's one of the biggest guitar festivals in the world because it's Eric Clapton's festival, and there's 400 guitarists that are all playing solos all night. And we were towards the end of the night, and I could tell Jeff got a kick out of, I'm not going to solo on one of my most well-known songs, Cause We've Ended as Lovers. Well, Stevie Wonder wrote it, but people know Jeff for that song and his solo on it. It's like, \"I'm going to give it to my bass player.\" And he did, and like-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You took it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The fact that he's bowing, he didn't have to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you really stepped up there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>an ambulance into a hospital overnight. The manager picked me up and I showed up at Jeff's door, which was a three-hour drive through windy country roads, and he answered the door, and he is like, \"Okay, you're ready to play?\" So we went upstairs and started rattling off the set. And when it came to this song, Cause We've Ended as Lovers, he just said solo, and he loved it and kept the solo in it. So that's how, there was no bass solo before I was playing in his band. So this whole thing was kind of new.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So even with food poisoning, you could step up?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's just like what? Instinct?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's just being able to differentiate from the body and from expression, music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting. You said fear walls you off from the other musicians, and what are you afraid of? You're afraid of making a mistake. Beethoven said, \"To play a wrong note is insignificant. To play without passion is inexcusable.\" Do you think the old man had a point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>constantly standing on the edge of the cliff, like wild. And so I don't care about those few little things. I care about the overall expression. And then there's other gigs that, for instance, if I got called for a pop or a country session or a show. In those environments, they may want you to play safe, just play the part and play it with a great groove and time and great dynamics and don't really veer away from the part and stuff. And I've done plenty of those gigs too. It's just a different hat you put on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you get from the veering? From the veering off the beaten path? You just love it? Or is that going to make the performance better? Why stand at the edge of the cliff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities and unknown. You don't know what's coming. And I love being there in the unknown. Otherwise, it's just like, \"Well, why are we doing this? Am I just like a clown on stage showing you my skills or what I've studied in my bedroom?\" It's like, no, I want to be pure expression happening right now and responding in real time to everything that's happening. And anytime I'm not doing that, it's like it's a waste of everybody's time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you ever messed it up real bad?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Messed what up?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, all comedians bomb. You're a big fan of comedy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you ever bombed on stage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably. I think it's all about recovery. And the more times that you fall off the cliff, the quicker you know how to recover and the varying ways that you can recover to the point in which it's concealed so much that maybe a listener might not even know that you're recovering.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And eventually you learn to fly, if we take that metaphor all the way, off the cliff. [inaudible 00:07:44]<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Remember one time when I was really young. Well, not really young, but when I was 21 or-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is age anyway?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I sat on this road case, everyone was out celebrating. I sat this road case, look with a sad face, boo-hoo. And then Claude Nobs, the owner of the whole festival, came out to me. He's like, \"Tal, what's wrong?\" And I'm like, \"I played a bad note.\" I was such a child. And he said all this wise stuff that Miles Davis had imparted to him and it fully cheered me up. He's like, \"Is there anything that would make you feel better?\" And I was like, \"Caviar?\" The dude came back 10 minutes later with this huge thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a joke. It was a joke, but he actually brought me caviar. But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being sad about a performance. Now I'm just like, \"Okay, whatever. It's done.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Was it a physical slip of the fingers or did you intend to play that note?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That I can't remember. I can't remember if it was just a bad choice that sounded like a clanger, why it happened. It was so long ago, but I don't get depressed about that anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That'd be funny if that was your biggest and only regret in life is that note, and that haunted you in your dreams.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then I'm on my deathbed and everyone's just bringing me caviar because the one-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Joke went way too far. You talked about confidence somewhere. I don't remember where. So I want to ask you about how much confidence it takes to be up there. You said something that Anthony Jackson told you as encouragement, line that I really like. That quote, \"On your worst day, you're still a bad motherfucker.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's actually a Steve Gadd quote. And Steve used to tell that to Anthony because Anthony used to get real depressed if he did a wrong thing or not perfect thing. And Steve Gadd used to say this to Anthony Jackson. And then Anthony was my first bass mentor or just mentor in general.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For people don't know, he's a legendary bassist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's a legendary bassist. And I started playing the bass when I was 17 and I moved to New York and I met Anthony and he started mentoring me bit in a very not typical way. He would just sit in his car with me for hours and talk music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You guys just listen to music and analyze it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And that was the best form of learning, I think. Just like, \"Well, what do you perceive here?\" And, \"Well, I heard this\" and just discussing that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Jazz usually?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, all styles of music. And yeah, he told me that story about on your worst day because yeah, even then when I was 18, 19, I'd get sad sometimes about performances. \"I could have done this.\" I don't do that anymore, thankfully. Or I'd be miserable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you always kind of feel pretty good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah, now I do. Now it's just I sense the body feeling fatigued, especially if it's a very long show. The ones I just did with three hour shows and we did one to three hour sound checks. So that's a lot of physical activity every day. So I just feel the body being tired, fatigued, the ears are fatigued. That's about it. I don't really reflect on the show much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're almost like from a third person perspective, feel the body get tired and just accept it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I don't want to identify with it then I'm tired, but I'm not tired.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's very Zen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm usually energized.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's like with the food poisoning, the mind is still capable of creative genius, even if the body is gone.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Something like that? So no self-critical component to the way you see your performances anymore?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is critique, but not in the way that it would diminish my sense of self. It's different. I can just kind of look at something and be like, \"Okay, well actually next time I'll do this choice and this choice, maybe. Maybe this would serve the song better. Maybe this would help the groove feel more like this.\" But it's not like, \"I suck because I did this and I'm a loser.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think that's bad? Even when I asked that question, I had a self-critical thought that, \"Why'd you ask that question? That's the wrong question.\" I always have the self-critical engine running. Is it necessarily a bad thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It depends. If it's affecting you negatively.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is negative anyway?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, if it brings your frequency down and you feel less joyful inside and less, you don't feel like complete, you feel less than, less worthy of something, than you could call that bad if you aspire to not feel that way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I aspire to not feel that way in the big picture, but in the little picture, a little pain is good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's fair.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So confidence. You seem like in this performance, you seem confident. You seem to be truly walking the bad motherfucker way of life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A word that I prefer over confidence is trust. Because I think with confidence is almost like is a belief assigned to it that I am this thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ego.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That you believe in. Whereas trust is just simply knowing that you can get up there and handle whatever is going to come your way. And it's more of an open feeling where it's like, \"Yeah, I could do this. Sure.\" But not like, \"I'm a bad motherfucker.\" You know what I mean? There's a huge difference because I've shared the stage with people who have a lot of confidence and it can be like a brick wall, just like fear is a brick wall.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the brick wall is a bad thing. The thing you have with Jeff here on stage-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Is not a brick wall.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's no wall, just chemistry.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How can you explain that chemistry the two of you had?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and also I will say that each individual has developed likes and dislikes over their lifetime. And that can be like in this case, we're just talking aesthetic likes and dislikes. So in this particular case, obviously our likes and dislikes are very much aligned such that the things I do to complement him, he enjoys and vice versa. But it could be two very trusting open musicians on stage that don't have walls up, but their choices are very different. And one person likes heavy metal and the other person likes classical. So it's got to be both.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you guys were good at yes and-sing each other musically?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that where you're most at peace in a meditative way? It's on stage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It used to be that it would only be on stage. It started with that. That was almost like my way into flow state and meditation was playing music. And then back in the day when I'd kind of crash after shows, I wanted to change that. I wanted to always feel like I'm in flow state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you succeeded?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've gotten a lot better. I'm still obviously on the journey, but yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you meditate? I think you said somewhere that you meditate before shows or just in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>which type of meditation. I don't put on a guided meditation. Everyone has their own thing they want to do. Maybe someone might be praying in their head, it doesn't matter. It's just the idea that we all put our phones down and we all are in one room connecting energetically, spiritually, and just letting our lives go for a second. And then we walk straight on the stage and it's always really connected. And there were a couple gigs where we ran out of time for that, and I could tell. There was a major difference in the performance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it both connects you and centers you, all of those things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But then when I'm home, I love to meditate and I've tried various styles of meditation and studied various types of things. So I don't do just one thing. I kind of customize it depending on where I'm at in my life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You and the world lost Jeff Beck a year ago. You told me you really miss him. How's the pain of losing Jeff change you? Maybe deepen your sense of the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the gear. I didn't want any responsibilities, financial, I just wanted to be completely free so that I could just process it and not feel like I had to commit to anything work-wise or creatively. I just wanted to unplug. And so this was a fun and very different way to unplug, because previously I may have just gone to a monastery and spent weeks at a monastery or months, but in this case I was like, \"You know what? This is a different kind of experience. I'm going to just hang out with comedians and stay in this room.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>With no responsibility, really.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he's like, \"I guess Jeff might be happy about this.\" And he's like, \"Well, I didn't want to let this one go. I was just trying to cheer you up a bit and maybe loan it to you for the tour, but if you really want it's yours.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God, this is... Mike Dirnt is the nicest guy ever.\" So that happened. So that bass' name is Jeff, and it's a white jazz bass, and I played it on the Incubus tour. But yeah, I do feel like I'm more equipped to handle grief now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Tell me about the Comedy Store a little bit more. Do you think comedians and musicians in some deep fundamental way are made from the same cloth? Are they spiritually connected somehow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way. So I think personality wise, comedians and musicians are quite different, actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In what way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people I would liken to hanging out with a comedian. It's very different from say somebody that is an instrumental guitarist or something like that, that they're more focused on, whether it's a kinesthetic thing or a physical thing or whatever it is. They're not quite doing the observational thing in the same way. So I just appreciate, my favorite thing to do is go on and laugh, especially because I can tend to be pretty analytical and be in my head. So anything that just kind of lets me be in my heart and just enjoy life is great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there's a photo of you with Dave Chappelle on stage. What was that about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So right after Leonard Cohen passed away, the Comedy Store threw me a birthday party. It was this crazy lineup, and it was like I'd play a song with my band, and then Jackson Brown sat in and sang a song, and then Dave Chappelle came up and said some jokes. It was one of my favorite nights ever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It was cool. It was a very healing birthday party.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's something magical about that place.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's really special.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, the Mothership has some magic to it too. It's really cool. It's different. Totally different vibe, but super awesome.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said that Leonard Cohen is a songwriting inspiration of yours. I saw you perform his song Chelsea Hotel, brilliantly on the internet. It's about, for people who don't know his love affair with Janet Joplin. How does that song make you feel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Great. I love that song.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which aspect? Musically, the melancholy feeling, the hopeful feeling, the cocky feeling? All of it, every single line has a different feeling to it, really.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But as a whole piece, I appreciate it so much. I actually lived at the Chelsea Hotel, and when Leonard and I first met, that was one of the first things we talked about was that I lived there, where all that stuff went down before they tore it apart. And yeah, it is just a beautiful song.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What makes me sad, the way it ends. \"I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best. I can't keep track of each fallen robin. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. That's all, I don't even think of you that often.\" That line, \" I don't even think of you that often\" always breaks my heart for some reason. ... I don't even think of you that often, always breaks my heart for some reason. How ephemeral, how short lasting certain love affairs can be. Just kind of like, huh.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think he meant it? I always think he's trying to convince himself of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It could be both, or either. That's the beautiful thing about poetry and lyric, is that it's supposed to be open.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I wonder if it's also open to him, depending on the day.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely. The thing that he taught me, or his advice to me was when you're writing a song, look at it the next morning, just first thing, and read it. And then take a walk, smoke a joint, read it again. Go have a fight with your daughter, come back, read it again. Get drunk, read it again. Wait a week, read it again. Just so that from every state and every position, the wider the lens is going to be from an audience perspective. You want things to mean multiple things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's one line I read somewhere, that he regrets putting in the song, so I've got to ask you about it. It's pretty edgy. It's about, \"Giving me head on the unmade bed.\" You think that's a good line, or a bad line?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's an amazing line. It's one of the best lines in the song.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>regretted the indiscretion. It wasn't that he regretted how great the line was, it was just the privacy factor. But then again, Leonard's known for rewriting his lyrics. In his live shows, you'll see a bunch of songs where it's like new lyrics. And he didn't do it because he didn't like the old lyrics, he just did it because he could, because he's Leonard. And it's like, why not have fun with words the way musicians have fun improvising solos on stage? And he could have changed that line in Chelsea Hotel after, in retrospect, and he never did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel. You were talking so brave and so sweet. Giving me head on the unmade bed, while the limousines wait in the street.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's so powerful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a powerful line. It just kind of shocks you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that's what's so great about it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also heartbreaking, because it doesn't last. Especially actually, to me it adds more meaning once you know it was Janis Joplin. It's like, okay, these two stars collided for a time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but why is it heartbreaking? It could also be just beautiful that they had a little fling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, everything is beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Even the dark stuff. What's not beautiful?

This is how you guys connected?<|eot_id|>"}

I ended up watching their whole rehearsal, and sitting there next to Roshi, his 105-year-old monk, which was really great. I remember when I was shaking his hand, it was just me and Roshi on the couch watching Leonard with this band. And we are shaking hands, and he grips my hand like this, doesn't let it go. And he looked in my eyes, he said, \"Where are you?\" And I said, \"In the handshake.\" He says, \"Yes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. You passed the test.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Passed the Roshi test. And then what's funny was that the next thing that happened about five minutes later, was Leonard Cohen got down on his knees and opened up a jar, I'm not kidding you, of caviar.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm divided about that answer. Because I think just things are flowing, I don't think anything's planned out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like through time, it's like an orchestra playing of different experiences and circumstances that are somehow connected.<|eot_id|>"}

Just whatever that is, is going to influence your future.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you had a really interesting trajectory through life. Maybe I just read it that way, because I've had a lot of stuff happen to me that's lucky, feels lucky. And sometimes I'll wonder, huh, this is weird.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that loneliness is a product of feeling separate from the world, and separate from others.

You give a piece of yourself, and then if that person dies or you break up with that person, you feel like you've lost that piece of yourself. Which I feel like is a very different experience than if you just are opening yourself. Rather than giving a piece of yourself, you're just opening yourself to somebody or something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So opening is fundamentally not a lonely experience.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

And usually you plan your touring for, you get the business aspect of things taken care of in advance, so you can just really be flowing day to day on a tour. And it's a great feeling. It's funny because this last tour that I did, we didn't have hotels every night. We had hotels maybe once a week. And I hadn't done that before. Usually I'm frequently in hotels.

Because I was in the back lounge, the bus is moving around like this, my laptop, the Zoom is like... and I'm just sitting meditating. It was like, yeah, this is the shit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's silence, so they're all connected to Zoom and just doing silent 12 hours a day?<|eot_id|>"}

In this particular retreat I do, there's a lot of silent sits, and then there's some guided meditations. But I've tried a lot of different avenues, and they're all great. I wouldn't just say, just try this one thing. I've studied the Upanishads with Vedanta teachers, and gone through those texts for months and months, and stayed at monasteries. And how they break it down makes total sense to my mind and heart.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, because your mind is the thinking tool. It's not you, you're not your mind, you're not your thoughts, you're not your body.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the day in the life of Tal in a monastery?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You wake up at 5:00 a.m. to the bell, and you go and meditate constantly until bedtime.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, if you're talking about the Zen monastery, because I stayed in Zen monastery, and I did a thing with the guy I was telling you about, the integral Zen thing where he uses Ken Wilber's work in combination with Zen. That's a little bit different, because he does talks, we talk about things. That's very separate from the Vedanta monasteries I've stayed at, which there's very little meditation in terms of sitting silently. Instead, we are meditating on the scriptures, like the Upanishads, and we're diving into that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What were the differences, the takeaways from the experiences? The two different, the integral one and the meditating on the scriptures?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>disciplined, and you go through a lot. Your body's purging a lot. There's a lot, and you don't necessarily have the answers as to what is happening. And so I think for somebody like me, I need both. I need to be in a place where there's complete uncertainty, but complete discipline, and just doing the regimented thing. And then there's the me that feels very satisfied from an analytical standpoint, understanding what's happening, what is the gross, and the subtle body? I want to understand these things about what it is to be a human. I like them both.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Understand what it means to be a human, so having that patience and just sitting with yourself helps you do that?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But sitting with yourself, there's no better education of facing every demon.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Who knows? Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Well, to be continued. Since I think I heard you say that you wrote a love song after Taxi Driver, what kind of love songs do you write more of? You're a songwriter first, for people who don't know. They might think you're primarily a bassist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But they're wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you write mostly broken heart ones, or hopeful love songs? In love songs, about to be in love songs, soon to fall in love songs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the last album I put out is pretty self- explanatory as to what that is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of pain in that one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There was, yeah. Some of it was storytelling, and some of it was real experience, and it's always a combination of things. I serve the song. Sometimes you use your own life experience to tell a song, and sometimes you may watch a movie, and part of that script merges with your own experience, and that tells the right story for the point you're trying to make in the song. It varies from song to song in terms of how autobiographical it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I always think at the end of the Taxi Driver, when... what's her name, Betsy? Because Travis becomes a hero, she tries to get with him, and he rejects her. That was powerful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My favorite love songs are the ones where you're not sure it's about romantic love, or love of God, or love of life, or just pure love.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've been writing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A little bit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't have an intention of putting something out in any particular timeframe, but I'm just writing and letting things flow.

I just love songs that aren't so specifically about one thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I really love the song to play it, to listen to it, Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton. And I thought it was pretty straightforward. And then I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein, who's a mutual friend of ours, and he told me it's not about what I thought it's about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, what did he say?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a more complicated story. It's actually a man... Wonderful Tonight is a story about a man being just finding his wife beautiful, and appreciating it throughout. But he said it was actually a man missing his wife, he's imagining. That she's lost, because of the decisions he's made in his life, so it's pain. He had a long, beautiful Eric Weinstein-like explanation of why.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love those.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you and Eric played music?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. We've just hung out and had very long conversations about everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's a bit of a musician, you know?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. You picked up the guitar when you were 14, let's go back. And one interesting thing that just jumped out at me is you said you learned how to practice in your head, because you only had 30 minutes. Your parents would only let you practice for 30 minutes. I read somewhere that Coltrane did the same. Not the practice part, but he was able to play instruments in his head as a way to think through different lines, different musical thoughts, that kind of stuff. Maybe, can you tell the story of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I just grew up in an environment that was focused on academia. And I fell in love with guitar, and really just wanted the focus to be that. My limit was 30 minutes a day for, I don't even remember how many times a week. Might've been every day, five days a week, whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So your parents didn't want you to play more than that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and that I learned how to do that. And in terms of learning fast, because I had to try to absorb a lot of information in a short amount of time when I did have the instrument, I kind of would do things in bursts. Even in that half an hour, I would just play for a couple minutes, and then I'd stop for a minute. And then I'd do it again, and I noticed there was a huge difference between the first time and the second time. Whereas if I just kept repeating stuff, it would be much slower.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did you do in that minute?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just hang out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just integrate?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>seconds or a minute, that in that 30 seconds or a minute, your brain does the repetition 20 to 30 times faster, and in reverse. And I was like, whoa, that's so cool. Because that's what I used to do when I was a kid, now there's science that proves that. Which is really cool for musicians to know that that's a good way to practice efficiently. Because some musicians, they're practicing for six, seven, eight hours a day. I've never done that. I've never practiced more than an hour a day, even now. That's my technique, and it works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you also practicing in your head sometimes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now, I'm not practicing as much. I'm more always writing songs in my head, so that's why I like silence. That's why I love being in the empty hotel room and being alone. Songs come to me while I'm showering, or walking around, doing the dishes. Or occasionally when I'm hanging out with friends, or comedians, and people will just say shit. And I'll be like, that's a cool line. Just jot it down on my phone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's not always musical, it's sometimes lyrical.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's more lyrical than musical now. Because for me it's like, well, there's so much music in the world. If I'm going to write a song, I want the song to be about something interesting. And so, yeah, the words matter to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And the right word has so much power. It's crazy, like we said with Leonard Cohen. And then they're often simple, the really powerful ones are simple.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And when you mentioned Hallelujah, he wrote like 80 verses to Hallelujah before he narrowed it down to four. And it took him like 15, 20 years to write that song. Some writers will do that, and then other writers just vomit it out and it's beautiful. I've heard that Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell, they're fast writers. It just kind of comes out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That makes me feel so good to know Leonard Cohen wrote so many verses of that. That was so deliberately crafted, extensively rigorously crafted.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>chords and everything's developing at once, at least for the first draft, that's very, very helpful. Sondheim used to write like that. He wouldn't move on until... he would just go this way. Whereas for me it's just like, I'll just go with what seems to be coming naturally, and I'll just let it be what it is. And then you come back and you say okay, well, what- Truly, and I'll just let it be what it is. And then you come back and you say, okay, well what do I have to do to this now? What's needed?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to linger on the learning process, what would you recommend for young musicians on how to get good? What are the different paths a person can take to understand it deeply enough to create something special?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think first and foremost, understanding why you are playing music. If it's because you have something that you're trying to express or that you're just in love with expression itself, with art itself, those are great reasons to start this journey.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The why should be-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the why is really important because it's a jagged lifestyle and there's a lot in it.

Okay. You think every instrument is its own journey.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>blah, blah. But that being said, we're all playing the same 12 or 24, however you divide the octave, that many notes. We're all playing the same notes. So in that sense, it's all the same thing. It's just music or better yet it's just art or expression. But yeah, every instrument has, you've got to go through the physical aspects of it, the motor skills and all of that, and hopefully you get through that really quickly so you can get to the expression quickly because if you get stuck in just that first phase, that'd be really boring.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that's a pretty long phase.

You don't need to necessarily have these people in person now. I mean, and then I'll say to that, yes and no. I agree with myself, and then I don't agree with myself. And the reason is I do believe that there is something that happens when you're in person with a master in some cases, that there is something transferred that is not intellectual, it's not spoken, it's something else that happens, that can happen, that I've experienced, and I really value that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I think that applies to specific disciplines and also generally. I've been around Olympic gold medalists just to hang out with them for several days, and there's something about greatness. There's a way about them that permeates the space around them. You kind of learn something from it, even if you don't practice that particular discipline, there's something to it if you're able to see it. I also like what you said about the playing stuff in your head, that it forces you to not be lost in the physical learning of the instrument. I think that's one of the things I probably regret a little bit. So I play both piano and guitar, and I've become quite, over the years, technically proficient at the instruments.<|eot_id|>"}

I can feel the music when it's created, but I can't create out of the feeling. I haven't practiced projecting the feeling onto the music. You know what I mean? I'm not like a musician.

And your unique sound is defined more by the choices you make rather than... I mean, it's equally as defined by the choices you make and the choices you don't make. I mean, it's the flip side of the same coin, really?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's certain musicians you can just tell.

Basically I put the song first and I think of the song as the melody, the lyrics, and then the harmony and obviously the groove.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the song goes before the genre in a sense. Each song is like its own thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>someone does something just to be hip, it's annoying to me. I think you can hear the difference.

But if it's not actually creating a piece of music that's going to move somebody, then why are you doing it?

It's usually after there's some sort of a break, but obviously there's exceptions to that rule. Sometimes it's take two, or three.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Moving on to the next question. By way of understanding- The next question is, by way of understanding, it's just there's something about the way you play bass that just pulls you in the way when you listen to somebody play a guitar, like a guitar solo.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The thing I love about Jeff Beck is that he played the guitar like a singer, and I think the way that Wayne Shorter played his saxophone. It's like a singer. And I think everyone, every musician, aspires to just sound like a singer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You make it sing. Let me ask you about... Just come back to Hendrix, because you said that you had three CDs, Jimi Hendrix, Herbie Hancock and Rage Against the Machine. First of all, a great combination. I'm a big Rage fan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's so funny, because when I listen to some of the music that I create, my solo music, I'm like, \"I could see how this is a combination of Herbie Hancock, Rage Against the Machine and Jimi Hendrix.\" I hear the influences. It's funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just from your musician perspective, what's interesting to you about... What really stands out to you about Hendrix? I just would love to hear a real, professional musician's opinion of Hendrix.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love that he is two voices combined into one voice. So it's like there is his voice on the guitar, there is his singing voice, and there is the combination of the two that make one voice. And of course the third element is songwriting. And all of this have this beautiful chemistry, and all work geniusly, perfectly together, and there's nothing like it. And he always beat himself up about being a singer, and he didn't like his voice, but my favorite singers are the singers that don't sound like singers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Bob Dylan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bob Dylan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you like Bob Dylan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Love Bob Dylan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You love his voice too?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love his voice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain your love affair with Bob Dylan's voice?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's expressing his lyrics. It's just pure expression, exactly what he means. I feel everything that he's saying with 100% authenticity. That's what I want to hear from a singer. I don't care how many runs you can do and blah blah blah. I want to believe what you're saying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Leonard Cohen is that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. There's countless, like Neil Young. I mean, there's so many musicians. I love Elliott Smith for that reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about mentorship. You said teachers and mentors. You had mentors. What's a good mentor for you, harsh or supportive?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Supportive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Supportive. You seen Whiplash, the movie? So that guy, somebody screaming at you, kicking you off the cliff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>doing, and practice...\" It's like, but why? What if that's not my path? That might be your path. So I'm not really... Again, otherwise it feels like a sport, like who can run the fastest race. And it's like, well, okay, I get that for sport maybe it makes sense to have someone a bit more hardcore. But still, I would say athletes have the same mentality. They've got that in them already too. So I think more of a strategic approach to mentorship works really well, and mainly just having an open space and just being available to someone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And show that they see the special in you, and they give you the room to develop that special whatever.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly, because if you do have that harsh critic inside you, it is nice to have somebody that isn't your family, or someone that's not obligated any way, that just sees your talent and they're like, \"Yeah, I dig what you're doing. Keep doing it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's funny that that's not always easy to come by.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you have any mentors?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've had a few recently, but for most of my life people didn't really... I'm very much like that too. Somebody to pat me on the back and see something in you of value. Yeah, I didn't really have that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you wish you did?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. But maybe the wishing that I did is the thing that made me who I am, not having it, the longing for that. Maybe that's the thing that helped me develop a constant sense of longing, which I think is a way of... Because I have that engine in me, it really allows me to deeply appreciate every single moment, everything that's given to me, so just eternal gratitude. You never know which are the bad parts and the good parts. If you remove one thing, the whole thing might collapse. I suppose I'm grateful for the whole thing. That one note you screwed up so many years ago, that might've been essential.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You do jujitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. Do you? Are you-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My dad does. My dad's super into it. I love my dad. He's the coolest. But no, I don't do it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not yet, but I plan on it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Should do it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What belt are you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Black belt.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sick. Do you want to go?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. You got the shit-talking part of jujitsu down. [inaudible 01:30:41] do the technique.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But for that, for instance, do you need a harsh mentor or teacher or-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but you said it really beautifully. To me, I agree, there's a difference between sport and art. They overlap for sure, but there's something about sport where perfection is actually... Perfection is really the thing you really want to get to, the technical perfection. With art, it feels like technical perfection is almost a way to get lost on the path to wherever, something unique. But yeah, with sport, I definitely am one of the kind of athletes that loves to have a dictatorial coach, somebody that helps me really push myself to the limit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you are the one that's dictating how hard you're getting pushed, in a way. You're choosing your mentor. That Whiplash video is like... He didn't ask for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 01:31:48] he might've.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, maybe. Maybe subconsciously. It's a movie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Next you're going to tell me they're just actors. But yeah, how do we choose things? You don't always choose, but you maybe subconsciously choose. And some of some of the great Olympic athletes I've interacted with, their parents for many years would force them to go to practice until they discovered the beauty of the thing that they were doing, and then they loved it. So at which point does something that looks like abuse become a gift? It's weird. It's all very weird. But for you, support and space to discover the thing, the voice, the music within you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's my personal choice, because I'm very familiar with the inner critic, and I can bring her out at any point. I don't need help with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you do have... She's on call.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She was on overdrive. That's why now I had to work on that so much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you have a really happy way about you right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're very Zen. Can I ask you about Bruce Springsteen?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of songs of his I listen to make me feel this melancholy feeling. Not just Bruce Springsteen, but Bruce does a lot. What is that about songs that arouse a sad feeling or a longing feeling or a feeling? What is that? What is that about us humans on the receiving end of the music?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Frequencies. Each frequency does elicit a different kind of emotional response. That is real, scientific-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mean on the physics aspect of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mean one thing. You can't analyze and be like, \"This is what this poet meant.\" And like we were talking about with Leonard earlier, it's like the broader you can leave a lyric, the better. You can appeal to people in so many different ways. And even to the songwriter. I'll sing some of my songs from five years ago and I'll be like, \"I didn't even think that it could have meant that, but I guess it does. That's funny.\" I'll just giggle onstage suddenly, because a lyric will hit me differently, from a different, new experience or something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you ever cried listening to a song?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course. Weep like a baby in a bathtub.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which? Who's the regular go-to, then?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just tackle the demons as early as possible, whether it's through your art or through meditation or through whatever it means, diaries, whatever it is.

If you avoid the demons, they become bigger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does that mean for you today? Are you still missing Jeff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>did give them a piece of myself, and maybe they gave me a piece of them that I hold with me and I cherish, but it doesn't feel like I'm less than, or they're less than, or anything's less than. You learn to appreciate the impermanence of everything in life, impermanence of everything except for... Consciousness, I guess you could say, is the only thing that is permanent. So everything else, you learn to appreciate that impermanence, because the limited amount of time in this particular body, it's enticing, gives you a time limit, which is cool. I like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've come to accept your own?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's cool that I'm like, \"Okay, I've got this amount...\" Maybe this amount of time. Who knows?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It could end today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, if I died today, I'd be really happy with my life.

Sure.\" I don't want to die. I have no reason to die. But if I did, I know that I put my everything, all my effort and all my passion and all my love, into whatever I've already done. So if my time's up, then my time's up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What role does love play in this whole thing, in the human condition?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, love is everything. I mean, if you define love... If you're talking about love as in romantic love or paternal or maternal love, or if you're talking about love as in an Eastern tradition, like Vedanta for instance, love is consciousness, love is everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the only permanent thing.<|eot_id|>"}
