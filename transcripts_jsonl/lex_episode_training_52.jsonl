{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because at the edge of the cliff is all possibilities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Tal Wilkenfeld, a singer-songwriter, bassist, guitarist, and a true musician who has recorded and performed with many legendary artists, including Jeff Beck, Prince, Eric Clapton, Incubus, Herbie Hancock, Mick Jagger, Jackson Brown, Rod Stewart, David Gilmore, Pharrell, Hans Zimmer, and many, many more. This was a fun and fascinating conversation. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear, dear friends, here's Tal Wilkenfeld. There's a legendary video of you playing with Jeff Beck. We're actually watching it in the background now. So for people who don't know, Jeff is one of the greatest guitarists ever. So you're playing with him at the 2007 Crossroads Festival, and people should definitely watch that video. You were killing it on the bass. Look at that face. Were you scared? What was that experience like? Were you nervous? You don't look nervous. Confident?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Jeff for that song and his solo on it. It's like, \"I'm going to give it to my bass player.\" And he did, and like-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You took it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The fact that he's bowing, he didn't have to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you really stepped up there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in it. So that's how, there was no bass solo before I was playing in his band. So this whole thing was kind of new.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So even with food poisoning, you could step up?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's just like what? Instinct?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's just being able to differentiate from the body and from expression, music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting. You said fear walls you off from the other musicians, and what are you afraid of? You're afraid of making a mistake. Beethoven said, \"To play a wrong note is insignificant. To play without passion is inexcusable.\" Do you think the old man had a point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't really veer away from the part and stuff. And I've done plenty of those gigs too. It's just a different hat you put on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you get from the veering? From the veering off the beaten path? You just love it?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>brought me caviar. But anyway, that's the one time that I remember being sad about a performance.

You talked about confidence somewhere. I don't remember where. So I want to ask you about how much confidence it takes to be up there.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>perfect thing. And Steve Gadd used to say this to Anthony Jackson.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he started mentoring me bit in a very not typical way. He would just sit in his car with me for hours and talk music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You guys just listen to music and analyze it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was the best form of learning, I think. Just like, \"Well, what do you perceive here?\" And, \"Well, I heard this\" and just discussing that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Jazz usually?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was 18, 19, I'd get sad sometimes about performances. \"I could have done this.\" I don't do that anymore, thankfully.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Something like that? So no self-critical component to the way you see your performances anymore?<|eot_id|>"}

Maybe this would help the groove feel more like this.\" But it's not like, \"I suck because I did this and I'm a loser.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think that's bad?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It depends. If it's affecting you negatively.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is negative anyway?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>feel like complete, you feel less than, less worthy of something, than you could call that bad if you aspire to not feel that way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I aspire to not feel that way in the big picture, but in the little picture, a little pain is good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's fair.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So confidence. You seem like in this performance, you seem confident. You seem to be truly walking the bad motherfucker way of life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I prefer over confidence is trust. Because I think with confidence is almost like is a belief assigned to it that I am this thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ego.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the day when I'd kind of crash after shows, I wanted to change that. I wanted to always feel like I'm in flow state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you succeeded?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've gotten a lot better. I'm still obviously on the journey, but yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you meditate? I think you said somewhere that you meditate before shows or just in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there were a couple gigs where we ran out of time for that, and I could tell.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think everyone's connected spiritually in the same way. So I think personality wise, comedians and musicians are quite different, actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In what way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pretty analytical and be in my head.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about was that I lived there, where all that stuff went down before they tore it apart.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think he meant it? I always think he's trying to convince himself of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It could be both, or either.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>from every state and every position, the wider the lens is going to be from an audience perspective.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's an amazing line. It's one of the best lines in the song.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>way musicians have fun improvising solos on stage?

Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also heartbreaking, because it doesn't last. Especially actually, to me it adds more meaning once you know it was Janis Joplin.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but why is it heartbreaking? It could also be just beautiful that they had a little fling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, everything is beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>actually when I put that song out on YouTube, that's when he sent me an email. He's like, \"Hey, do you want to come over?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice. This is how you guys connected?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this, doesn't let it go. And he looked in my eyes, he said, \"Where are you?\" And I said, \"In the handshake.\" He says, \"Yes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. You passed the test.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm divided about that answer.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think everything's connected, so yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But predetermined means-<|eot_id|>"}
