She is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist interested in the origin of life and in discovering alien life on other worlds. She has written an amazing new upcoming book titled Life As No One Knows It, The Physics of Life's Emergence. This book is coming out on August 6th, so please go pre-order it now. It will blow your mind. This is The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sara Walker. You open the book, Life As No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence, with the distinction between the materialists and the vitalists. So what's the difference? Can you maybe define the two?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>really special about the matter of life and the material substrates that life is made out of, so they disagree on some really fundamental points.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a gray area between the two? Maybe all there is is matter, but there's so much we don't know that it might as well be magic. Whatever that magic that the vitalists see, meaning there's just so much mystery that it's really unfair to say that it's boring and understood and as simple as \"physics.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we learn what those things are. And they still have an air of mystery even when we understand them. There's no bottom to our understanding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So do you think the vitalists have a point that they're more eager and able to notice the magic of life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thing that we call life. Life could be a material property and still have a lot of the features that the vitalists thought were mysterious.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we may still expand our understanding, what is incorporated in the category of matter, that will eventually incorporate such magical things that the vitalists have noticed, like life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a unified description of what life is or the kind of things that evolution builds because we haven't really invented the right material concept yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when talking about motion, the laws of physics appear to be the same everywhere out in the universe. You think the same is true for other kinds of matter that we might eventually include life in?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>us about the nature of life in the universe and will allow us to identify life that we can't yet recognize because it's too different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're right about the paradox of defining life. Why does it seem to be so easy and so complicated at the same time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>why fire is so hard. And so we've had a really hard time trying to pin down from a definitional perspective exactly what life is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you actually bring up the zombie-ant fungus. I enjoyed looking at this thing as an example of one of the challenges. You mentioned viruses, but this is a parasite. Look at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Did you see this in the jungle?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Infects ants. Actually, one of the interesting things about the jungle, everything is ephemeral. Everything eats everything really quickly. So if an organism dies, that organism disappears. It's a machine that doesn't have... I wanted to say it doesn't have a memory or a history, which is interesting given your work on history in defining a living being. The jungle forgets very quickly. It wants to erase the fact that you existed very quickly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or every possible zombie ant or every possible tree, will ever live. So it's an incredibly dynamic and creative place because of all that death.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is a parasite that needs the ant. So is this a living thing or is this not a living thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just pierces the ant.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I've seen a lot of this, by the way. Organisms working together in the jungle, like ants protecting a delicious piece of fruit. They need the fruit, but if you touch that fruit, the forces emerge. They're fighting you. They're defending that fruit to the death. Nature seems to find mutual benefits, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the two of them together are alive in some sense, but they're now in this weird symbiotic relationship that's taking this ant to its death.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what do you do with that in terms of when you try to define life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>terrible, and I think it's terrible that people use it. I think every word in that definition is actually wrong as a descriptor of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Life is a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Why is that? That seems like a pretty good definition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know. If you want to make me angry, you can pretend I said that and believed it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So self-sustaining, chemical system, Darwinian evolution. What is self-sustaining? What's so frustrating? Which aspect is frustrating to you, but it's also those are very interesting words.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because chemistry is the first thing the universe builds where it cannot exhaust all the possibilities, because the combinatorial space of chemistry is too large.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, but is it possible to have a life that is not a chemical system?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a guy I know named Lee Cronin who's been on a podcast a couple of times who just got really pissed off listening to this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know. What a coincidence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He probably just got really pissed off hearing that. For people who somehow don't know, he's a chemist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but he would agree with that statement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would he? I don't think he would. He would broaden the definition of chemistry until it'll include everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or maybe, I don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But wait, but you said that universe, the first thing it creates is chemistry.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stuff that we can talk about, but the universe has to actually make historically contingent choices in chemistry because it can't exhaust all possible molecules.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What kind of things can you create that's outside the combinatorial space of chemistry? That's what I'm trying to understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>cell, but they seem much more abstract. So for example, I think language is alive, or at least life. I think memes are. I think-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying language is life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Language is alive. Oh boy, I'm going to have to explore that one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that structure look like? And I think we look really different than the way that we talk about what we look like to each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think a living organism in math is? Is it one axiomatic system or is it individual theorems or is it individual steps of-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you see with the revolution in the last century with Godel's Theorem and Turing. And there's clear places where mathematics notices holes in the universe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it seems like you're sneaking up on a different kind of definition of life. Open-ended, large combinatorial space.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Room for creativity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely not chemical. Chemistry is one substrate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Restricted to chemical. What about the third thing, which I think will be the hardest because you probably like it the most, is evolution or selection.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>right now is not evolving by canonical theories of evolution. In assembly theory, which is attempting to explain life, evolution is a much broader thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So an individual organism can evolve under assembly theory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, you're constructing yourself all the time. Assembly theory is about construction and how the universe selects for things to exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What if you reformulate everything like a population is a living organism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this again gets back to it. We can nitpick at definitions. I don't think it's incredibly helpful to do it. But the reason for me-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>definitions break down because they're not general enough, they're not universal enough, they're not deep enough, they're not abstract enough to actually capture that regularity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because we're focused on that little ephemeral thing and call it human life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's like Aristotle focusing on heavy things falling because they're earth-like, and things floating because they're air-like. It's the wrong thing to focus on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What exactly are we missing by focusing on such a short span of time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because I think it literally changes the structure of your brain and you see the world differently, especially when you're trying to build new abstractions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's possible if you're a theoretical physicist, that it's easy to fall off the cliff and descend into madness?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that whatever I'm pulling from that space is something that's really usable and really relates to the world outside of me. That's what science is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we were talking about what we're missing when we look at a small stretch of time in a small stretch of space.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you imagine that that entire history is you, that is the picture I have in my mind when I look at every living thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a tweet for everything. You tweeted-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Doesn't everyone?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a lot of poetic, profound tweets. Sometimes-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... they're puzzles that take a long time to figure out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a very deep idea into a short amount of space, and I really like doing that intellectual exercise because I find it productive for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's a very interesting kind of compression algorithm though.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I like language. I think it's really fun to play with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I wonder if AI can decompress it. That'd be an interesting challenge.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>language in certain ways that are non-canonical and I do it very purposefully. And it would be interesting to me how AI would interpret it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, your tweets would be a good Turing Test for super intelligence. Anyway, you tweeted that things only look emergent because we can't see time. So if we could see time, what would the world look like? You're saying you'll be able to see everything that an object has been, every step of the way that led to this current moment, and all the interactions that require to make that evolution happen. You would see this gigantic tail.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The universe is far larger in time than it is in space, and this planet is one of the biggest things in the universe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the more complexity, the bigger the object-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think the modern technosphere is the largest object in time in the universe that we know about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you say technosphere, what do you mean?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean the global integration of life and technology on this planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So all the technological things we've created?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but sometimes they go through a picture before they get to words. But I like experimenting with words because I think they help paint pictures.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's, again, some kind of compressed feeling that you can query to get a sense of the bigger visualization that you have in mind. It's just a really nice compression. But I think the idea of this object that in it contains all the information about the history of an entity that you see now, just trying to visualize that is pretty cool. Obviously, the mind breaks down quickly as you step seconds and minutes back in time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess it's just a gigantic object we're supposed to be thinking about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that the space that we can go back into is really large. So the more abstract you're going, the deeper you're going in that space.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But in that sense, aren't we fundamentally all connected?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of life cannot be the individual. It has to be these lineages because they're all connected, they're interwoven, and they're exchanging parts all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so maybe there are certain aspects of those lineages that can be lifelike. They can be characteristics. They can be measured with the sunbeam theory that have more or less life, but they're all just fingertips of a much bigger object.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and project it into things that we really can understand and say, \"This is the one thing that we're seeing,\" because it's not one thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's funny we're talking about this now and I'm slowly starting to realize, one of the things I saw when I took Ayahuasca, afterwards actually, so the actual ceremony is four or five hours, but afterwards you're still riding whatever the thing that you're riding. And I got a chance to afterwards hang out with some friends and just shoot the shit in the forest, and I could see their faces. And what was happening with their faces and their hair is I would get this interesting effect. First of all, everything was beautiful and I just had so much love for everybody, but I could see their past selves behind them. I guess it's a blurring effect of where if I move like this, the faces that were just there are still there and it would just float like this behind them, which will create this incredible effect. But another way to think about that is I'm visualizing a little bit of that object of the thing they were just a few seconds ago. It's a cool little effect.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's very cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And now it's giving it a bit more profundity to the effect that was just beautiful aesthetically, but it's also beautiful from a physics perspective because that is a past self. I get a little glimpse at the past selves that they were. But then you take that to its natural conclusion, not just a few seconds ago, but just to the beginning of the universe. And you could probably get to that-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Billions of years, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... get down that lineage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's crazy that there's billions of years inside of all of us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of us. And then we connect obviously not too long ago.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned just the technosphere, and you also wrote that the most, the live thing on this planet is our technosphere. Why is the technology we create a kind of life form? Why are you seeing it as life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>view into the nature of life, which I think is necessary also to solve the origin of life, then you have to include those things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All of them, so you have to simultaneously think about-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Every scale.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... life at every single scale.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The planetary and the bacteria level.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>planet that might be an example of life, which is pretty much everything, and then trying to figure out what's the deeper structure underlying that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the fact that I can talk about those things is telling me something about the structure of where I actually live and where I exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just because it's more constructive doesn't mean it's true.<|eot_id|>"}
