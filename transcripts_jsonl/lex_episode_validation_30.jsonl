{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The act of remembering can change the memory. If you remember some event and then I tell you something about the event, later on when you remember the event, you might remember some original information from the event as well as some information about what I told you. And sometimes if you're not able to tell the difference, that information that I told you gets mixed into the story that you had originally. So now I give you some more misinformation or you're exposed to some more information somewhere else and eventually your memory becomes totally detached from what happened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Charan Ranganath, a psychologist and neuroscientist at UC Davis specializing in human memory. He's the author of, Why We Remember. Unlocking Memory's Power To Hold On To What Matters. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Charan Ranganath. Danny Kahneman describes the experiencing self and the remembering self and that happiness and satisfaction you gained from the outcomes of your decisions do not come from what you've experienced, but rather from what you remember of the experience. So can you speak to this interesting difference that you write about in your book of the experiencing self and the remembering self?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there is that the way we remember things is not the replay of the experience, it's something totally different. And it tends to be biased by the beginning and the end, and he talks about the peaks, but there's also the best parts, the worst parts, etc. And those are the things that we remember. And so when we make decisions, we usually consult memory and we feel like our memory is a record of what we've experienced, but it's not. It's this kind of very biased sample, but it's biased in an interesting and I think biologically relevant way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in the way we construct a narrative about our past, you say that it gives us an illusion of stability. Can you explain that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>make sense. I mean really memory is all about the present and the future. The past is done. So biologically speaking, it's not important unless there's something from the past that's useful. And so what our brains are really optimized for is to learn about the stuff from the past that's going to be most useful and understanding the present and predicting the future. And so cause-effect relationships for instance, that's a big one. Now my future is completely unpredictable in the sense that you could in the next 10 minutes pull a knife on me and slit my throat.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was planning on it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not real, it's imagined. And it's amazing that we have this capability and that's what memory is about. But it can also give us the illusion that we know everything that's about to happen. And I think what's valuable about that illusion is when it's broken, it gives us the information. So I mean, I'm sure being in AI about information theory and the idea is the information is what you didn't already have. And so those prediction errors that we make based on, we make a prediction based on memory and the errors are where the action is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The error is where the learning happens.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, just to linger on Danny Kahneman and just this whole idea of experiencing self versus remembering self, I was hoping you can give a simple answer of how we should live life based on the fact that our memories could be a source of happiness or could be the primary source of happiness, that an event when experienced bears its fruits the most when it's remembered over and over and over and over. And maybe there is some wisdom in the fact that we can control to some degree how we remember it, how we evolve our memory of it, such that it can maximize the long-term happiness of that repeated experience.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well first I'll say I wish I could take you on the road with me because that was such a great description.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I be your opening act?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh my God, no, I'm going to open for you, dude. Otherwise, it's like everybody leaves after you're done. Believe me, I did that in Columbus, Ohio once. It wasn't fun. The opening acts drank our bar tab. We spent all this money going all the way there and there was only the... Everybody left after the opening acts were done and there was just that stoner dude with the dreadlocks hanging out. And then next thing you know, we blew our savings on getting a hotel room.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we should as a small tangent, you're a legit touring act?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>When I was in grad school, I played in a band and yeah, we traveled, we would play shows.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer. So that's a good movie.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>All right, we're getting back to life advice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And happiness, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that you're talking about. When I was growing up, my parents worked really hard for us and we went on some vacations, but not very often. And I really try to do now vacations to interesting places as much as possible with my family because those are the things that you remember. So I really do think about what's going to be something that's memorable and then just do it even if it's a pain in the ass because the experiencing self will suffer for that but the remembering self will be like, \"Yes, I'm so glad I did that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do things that are very unpleasant in the moment because those can be reframed and enjoyed for many years to come. That's probably good advice. Or at least when you're going through, it's a good way to see the silver lining of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean I think it's one of these things where if you have people who you've gone through since you said it, I'll just, since you've gone through shit with someone-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it was definitely, Randy and I were already tight, but that was a real bonding experience for us. And I learned from that that it's like I don't look back on that enough actually because I think we often, at least for me, I don't necessarily have the confidence to think that things will work out, that I'll be able to get through certain things. But my ability to actually get something done in that moment is better than I give myself credit for, I think. And that was the lesson of that story that I really took away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, actually just for me, you're making me realize now it's not just those kinds of stories, but even things like periods of depression or really low points, to me at least it feels like a motivating thing that the darker it gets, the better the story will be if you emerge on the other side. That to me feels like a motivating thing. So maybe if people listening to this and they're going through some shit, as we said, one thing that could be a source of light is that it'll be a hell of a good story when it's all over, when you emerge on the other side. Let me ask you about decisions. You already talked about it a little bit, but when we face the world and we're making different decisions, how much does our memory come into play? Is it the kind of narratives that we've constructed about the world that are used to make predictions that's fundamentally part of the decision-making?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that kind of reasoning that goes into it too. I think even if you think about the big decisions in life. It's like you and I were talking before we started recording about how I got into memory research and you got into AI and it's like we all have these personal reasons that guide us in these particular directions. And some of it's the environment and random factors in life, and some of it is memories of things that we want to overcome or things that we build on in a positive way. But either way, they define us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And probably the earlier in life the memories happen, the more defining, the more defining power they have in terms of determining who we become.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>feel like every decision you make is consequential in forming this child and it plays a role, but so do the child's peers. And so do... There's so much, I mean that's why I think the big part of education I think that's so important is not the content you learn... I mean, think of how much dumb stuff we learned in school. But a lot of it is learning how to get along with people and learning who you are and how you function. And that can be terribly traumatizing even if you have perfect parents working on you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some insight into the human brain that explains why we don't seem to remember anything from the first few years of life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>brain is so plastic, the cortex is so plastic during that time, and we think that memories for events are very distributed across the brain. Imagine you're trying to get back that pattern of activity that happened during this one moment, but the roads that you would take to get there have been completely rerouted. I think that's my best explanation. The third explanation is a child's sense of self takes a while to develop. And so their experience of learning might be more learning what happened as opposed to having this first-person experience of, \"I remember. I was there.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think somebody once said to me that kind of loosely philosophically that the reason we don't remember the first few years of life, infantile amnesia is because how traumatic it is. Basically the error rate that you mentioned when your brain's prediction doesn't match reality, the error rate in the first few years of life, your first few months certainly, is probably crazy high. It's non-stop freaking out. The collision between your model of the world and how the world works is just so high that you want whatever the trauma of that is not to linger around. I always thought that's an interesting idea because just imagine the insanity of what's happening in a human brain in the first couple of years. You don't know anything and there's just this stream of knowledge and we're somehow, given how plastic everything is, it just kind of molds and figures it out. But it's like an insane waterfall of information.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>idea that really when you're older in most societies, your job is no longer to form new episodic memories, it's to pass on the memories that you already have, this knowledge about the world, what we call semantic memory, to pass on that semantic memory to the younger generations, pass on the culture. Even now in indigenous cultures, that's the role of the elders. They're respected, they're not seen as people who are past it and losing it. And I thought that was a very poignant thing, that memory is doing what it's supposed to throughout these stages of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it is always optimal in a sense.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just optimal for that stage of life<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're the ones that pass on the traditions to I guess the younger generation of orcas. And if you look from what little I understand, different orca pods have different traditions. They hunt for different things. They have different play traditions, and that's a culture. And so in social animals, evolution I think is designing brains that are really around, it's obviously optimized for the individual but also for kin. And I think that the kin are part of this when they're a part of this intense social group, the brain development should parallel that, the nature of the ecology.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's just fascinating to think of the individual orca or human throughout its life in stages doing a kind of optimal wisdom development. So in the early days, you don't even know what the goal is, and you figure out the goal and you optimize for that goal and you pursue that goal. And then all the wisdom you collect through that, then you share with the others in the system, the other individuals. And as a collective, then you kind of converge towards greater wisdom throughout the generations. So in that sense, it's optimal. Us humans and orcas got something going on. It works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah. Apex predators.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just got a megalon on tooth, speaking of apex predators.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just imagine the size of that thing. Anyway, how does the brain forget and how and why does it remember? So maybe some of the mechanisms. You mentioned the hippocampus, what are the different components involved here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>aren't the biological signals which we can get into, I would promote long-term retention. And lots of times we forget because we can't find the cue that sends us back to the right memory, and we need the right cue to be able to activate it. So for instance, in a neural network there is no... You wouldn't go and you'd say, \"This is the memory.\" It's like the whole network, I mean, the whole ecosystem of memories is in the weights of the neural network. And in fact, you could extract entirely new memories depending on how you feed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have to have the right query, the right prompt to access that whatever the part you're looking for.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And in humans, you have this more complex set of ways memory works. There's, as I said, the knowledge or what you call semantic memory, and then there's these memories for specific events, which we call episodic memory. And so there's different pieces of the puzzle that require different kinds of cues. So that's a big part of it too, is just this kind of what we call retrieval failure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned episodic memory, you mentioned semantic memory, what are the different separations here? What's working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, what are the interesting categories of memory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you. Now, to build that model though, you need to pull out stuff from your general knowledge of the world, which is what we call semantic memory. And then you'd want to be able to pull out memories for specific events that happened in the past, which we call episodic memory. So in a way, they're all connected, even though it's different. The things that we're focusing on and the way we organize information in the present, which is working memory, will play a big role in determining how we remember that information later, which people typically call long-term memory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you have something like a birthday party and you've been to many before, you're going to load that from disk into working memory, this model, and then you're mostly operating on the model. And if it's a new task, you don't have a model so you're more in the data collection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>remember reading my book to pull out the episodic memory to make sense of whatever it is I'm babbling about. And so there's this beautiful dynamics that you can see in the brain of these different networks that are coming together and then deaffiliating at different points in time that are allowing you to go into these modes. And so to speak to your original question, to some extent, when we're talking about semantic memory and episodic memory and working memory, you can think about it as these processes that are unfolding as these networks come together and pull apart,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can memory be trained and improved? This beautiful connected system that you've described, what aspect of it is a. ... you've described. What aspect of it is a mechanism that can be improved through training?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot with military like Navy SEALs and stuff to do this kind of work with mindfulness meditation. Adam Gazzaley, another one of my friends and colleagues, has worked on training through video games actually as a way of training attention. So it's not clear to me, one of the challenges, though, in training is you tend to overfit to the thing that you're trying to optimize. If I'm looking at a video game, I can definitely get better at paying attention in the context of the video game, but you transfer it to the outside world, that's very controversial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The implication there is that attention is a fundamental component of remembering something, allocating attention to it, and then attention might be something that you could train, how you allocate attention and how you hold attention on a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By all accounts, from people who become memory athletes, they weren't born with some extraordinary memory, but they practice strategies over and over and over again. The strategy that they use for memorizing a particular thing, it can become automatic, and you can just deploy it in an instant. Again, one strategy for learning the order of a deck of cards might not help you for something else that you need like remembering your way around Austin, Texas. But it's going to be these, whatever you're interested in, you can optimize for that. That's just a natural byproduct of expertise.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a certain hacks. There's something called the Memory Palace that I played with. I don't know if you're familiar with that-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... whole technique, and it works. It's interesting. So another thing I recommend for people a lot is I use Anki a lot every day. It's an app that does spaced repetition. Medical students use this a lot to remember a lot of different things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. We can come back to this, but yeah, go ahead.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. It's the whole concept of spaced repetition. When the thing is fresh, you have to remind yourself of it a lot and then, over time, you can wait a week, a month, a year before you have to recall the thing again. That way, you essentially have something like note cards that you can have tens of thousands of and can only spend 30 minutes a day and actually be refreshing all of that information, all of that knowledge. It's really great. For Memory Palace, it's a technique that allows you to remember things like the Ikea catalog by placing them visually in a place that you're really familiar with, like, \"I'm really familiar with this place,\" so I can put numbers or facts or whatever you want to remember you can walk along that little palace and it reminds you. It's cool. There's stuff like that that I think memory athletes could use, but I think also regular people can use. One of those things that I have to solve for myself is how to remember names. I'm horrible at it. I think it's because when people introduce themselves, I have the social anxiety of the interaction where I'm like, \"I know I should be remembering that,\" but I'm freaking out internally about social interaction in general, and so therefore, I forget immediately, so I'm looking for good tricks for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>completely arbitrary thing. Maybe in the olden days, somebody named Miller, it's like they're actually making flour or something like that. For the most part, it's like these names are just utterly arbitrary, so you have no thing to latch on to. It's not really a thing that our brain does very well to learn meaningless, arbitrary stuff. So what you need to do is build connections somehow, visualize a connection, and sometimes it's obvious or sometimes it's not. I'm trying to think of a good one for you now, but the first thing I think of is Lex Luthor-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... that I can think of. Yeah, so I think with Lex Luthor-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Doesn't Lex Luthor wear a suit, I think?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know he has a shaved head, though, or he's bald, which you're not. I'd trade hair with you any day-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... but for something like that. If I can come up with something, I could say, \"Okay, so Lex Luthor is this criminal mastermind,\" then I'd just imagine you-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We talked about stabbing or whatever earlier about [inaudible 00:41:07]-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... all just connected and that's it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Memory Palace technique is all about is you have a pre-existing structure in your head of your childhood home or this mental palace that you've created for yourself. So now you can put arbitrary pieces of information in different locations in that mental structure of yours and then you can walk through the different path and find all the pieces of information you're looking for. The method of loci is a great method for just learning arbitrary things because it allows you to link them together and get that cue that you need to pop in and find everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We should maybe linger on this Memory Palace thing just to make it obvious, 'cause when people were describing to me a while ago what this is, it seems insane. You literally think of a place like a childhood home or a home that you're really visually familiar with and you literally place in that three-dimensional space facts or people or whatever you want to remember, and you just walk in your mind along that place visually and you can remember, remind yourself of the different things. One of the limitations is there is a sequence to it. You can't just go upstairs right away or something. You have to walk along the room. It's really great for remembering sequences, but it's also not great for remembering individual facts out of context. The full context of the tour, I think, is important, but it's fascinating how the mind is able to do that. When you ground these pieces of knowledge into something that you remember well already, especially visually, it's fascinating. I think you do that for any kind of sequence. I'm sure she used something like this for the Ikea catalog, something of this nature.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>lot of memory athletes will use stories and they'll go, like if you're memorizing a deck of cards, they have a little code for the different, the King and the Jack and the 10 and so forth. They'll make up a story about things that they're doing and that'll work. Songs are a great one. I can still remember there's this obscure episode of the TV show Cheers. They song about Albania that he uses to memorize all these facts about Albania. I could still sing that song to you as just as I saw it on the TV show.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned space repetition. So do you like this process? Maybe can you explain it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that are associated with a specific place and time, and you heighten the information about the content. So if you remember this information in different times in different places, it's more accessible at different times in different places because it's not overfitted in an AI way of thinking about things. It's not overfitted to one particular context. But that's also why the memories that we call upon the most also feel like they're just things that we read about almost. You don't vividly reimagine them, right? It's like they're just these things that just come to us, like facts, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a little bit different than semantic memory, but it's like basically these events that we have recalled over and over and over again, we keep updating that memory so it's less and less tied to the original experience. But then we have those other ones, which it's like you just get a reminder of that very specific context. You smell something, you hear a song, you see a place that you haven't been to in a while, and boom, it just comes back to you. That's the exact opposite of what you get with spacing, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's so fascinating. So with space repetition, one of its powers is that you lose attachment to a particular context, but then it loses the intensity of the flavor of the memory.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's interesting. That's so interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but at the same time, it becomes stronger in the sense that the content becomes stronger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's used for learning languages, for learning facts, for that generic semantic information type of memories.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you expose, \"Here's the bad connections, and here's the good connections.\" So we can keep the parts of the cell assembly that are good for the memory and lose the ones that are not so good. But if you don't stress test the memory, you haven't exposed it to the error fully. So that's why I think this is a thing that I come back to over and over again, is that you will retain information better if you're constantly pushing yourself to your limit. If you are feeling like you're coasting, then you're actually not learning, so it's like-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You should always be stress testing the memory system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the moment they're overconfident about what they'll retain later on. So it's fascinating. So what happens is when you test yourself, you're like, \"Oh, my God, I thought I knew that, but I don't.\" So it can be demoralizing until you get around that and you realize, \"Hey, this is the way that I learn. This is how I learned best.\" It's like if you're trying to star in a movie or something like that, you don't just sit around reading the script. You actually act it out, and you're going to botch those lines from time to time, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You know what? There's an interesting moment, you probably have experienced this. I remember a good friend of mine, Joe Rogan, I was on his podcast, and we were randomly talking about soccer, football, somebody I grew up watching Diego Armando Maradona, one of the greatest soccer players of all time. We were talking about him and his career and so on, and Joe asked me if he's still around. I said, \" Yeah.\" I don't know why I thought, \"Yeah,\" because that was a perfect example of memories. He passed away. I tweeted about it, how heartbroken I was, all this kind of stuff a year before. I know this, but in my mind, I went back to the thing I've done many times in my head of visualizing some of the epic runs he had on goal and so on. So for me, he's alive. Part of also the conversation when you're talking to Joe, there's stress and the focus is allocated. The attention is allocated in a particular way. But when I walked away, I was like, \"In which world was Diego Maradona still alive?\" 'Cause I was sure in my head that he was still alive. It's a moment that sticks with me. I've had a few like that in my life where it just... obvious things just disappear from mind, and it's cool. It shows actually the power of the mind in the positive sense to erase memories you want erased maybe, but I don't know. I don't know if there's a good explanation for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that he called remembering an imaginative construction, meaning that we don't replay the past, we imagine how the past could have been by taking bits and pieces that come up in our heads. Likewise, he wrote this beautiful paper on imagination saying when we imagine something and create something, we're creating it from these specific experiences that we've had and combining it with our general knowledge. But instead of trying to focus it on being accurate and getting out one thing, you're just ruthlessly recombining things without any necessary goal in mind, or at least that's one kind of creation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So imagination is fundamentally coupled with memory in both directions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to support this, we've broken up this network in various sub pieces, is that basically it's taking apart all of our experiences and creating these little Lego blocks out of them. Then you can put them back together if you have the right instructions to recreate these experiences that you've had, but you could also reassemble them into new pieces to create a model of an event that hasn't happened yet, and that's what we think happens when our common ground that we're establishing in language requires using those building blocks to put together a model of what's going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a good percentage of time I personally live in the imagined world. I do thought experiments a lot. I take the absurdity of human life as it stands and play it forward in all kinds of different directions. Sometimes it's rigorous thoughts, thought experiments, sometimes it's fun ones. So I imagine that that has an effect on how I remember things. I suppose I have to be a little bit careful to make sure stuff happened versus stuff that I just imagined happened. Some of my best friends are characters inside books that never even existed. There's some degree to which they actually exist in my mind. Like these characters exist, authors exist, Dostoevsky exists, but also Brothers Karamazov.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love that book. One of the few books I've read. One of the few literature books that I've read, I should say. I read a lot in school that I don't remember, but Brothers Karamazov, I remember. Alyosha-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They exist, and I have almost conversations with them, it's interesting. It's interesting to allow your brain to play with ideas of the past of the imagined and see it all as one.<|eot_id|>"}

But it also really haunted him by some reports that basically it was like he was at some point, and again, who knows if the drinking was part of this, but he at some point had trouble differentiating his imagination from reality. This is interesting because it's like that's what psychosis is in some ways is first of all, you're just learning connections from prediction errors that you probably shouldn't learn. The other part of it is is that your internal signals are being confused with actual things in the outside world. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's why a lot of this stuff is both feature and bug. It's a double-edged sword.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it might be why there's such an interesting relationship between genius and psychosis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Maybe they're just two sides of the same coin. Humans are fascinating, aren't they?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so, sometimes scary, but mostly fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we just talk about memory sport a little longer? There's something called the USA Memory Championship. What are these athletes like? What does it mean to be elite level at this? Have you interacted with any of them or reading about them, what have you learned about these folks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of memory athletes is they buy a book by other memory athletes or other memory experts, so to speak. And they just learn those skills and practice them over and over again. They start by winning bets and so forth. And then they go into these competitions. And the competitions are typically things like memorizing long strings of numbers or memorizing orders of cards and so forth. So they tend to be pretty arbitrary things, not things that you'd be able to bring a lot of prior knowledge. But they build the skills that you need to memorize arbitrary things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's fascinating. I've gotten a chance to work with something called n-back tasks. So there's all these kinds of tasks, memory recall tasks that are used to kind of load up the quote-unquote, working memory.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The psychologist used it to test all kinds of stuff to see how well you're good at multitasking. We used it in particular for the task of driving. If we fill up your brain with intensive working memory tasks, how good are you at also not crashing, that kind of stuff. So it's fascinating, but again, those tasks are arbitrary and they're usually about recalling a sequence of numbers in some kind of semi-complex way. Do you have any favorite tasks of this nature in your own studies?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out every coordinate in a space, you form a pretty economical graph that connects basically the major landmarks together? And being able to use that as emphasizing the things that are most important, the places that you go for food and the places that are landmarks that help you get around. And then filling in the blanks for the rest, because I really believe that cognitive maps or mental maps of the world, just like our memories for events are not photographic. I think they're this combination of actual verifiable details and then a lot of inference that you make.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What have you learned about this kind of spatial mapping of places? How do people represent locations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to the emotion thing, right? Because if you have limited choices, if I'm walking down a street, I could really just get a mental map of the neighborhood with a more minimal kind of thing by just saying, \"Here's the intersections and here's the directions I take to get in between them.\" And what we found in general in our MRI studies is basically the more people can reduce the problem, whether it's space or any kind of decision-making problem, the less the hippocampus encodes. It really is very economical towards the points of most highest information, content and value.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you describe the encoding in the hippocampus and the ripples you were talking about? What's the signal in which we see the ripples?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the sequence of activity in the brain that was taking place earlier. And during those moments, there's a little window of communication between the hippocampus and these areas in the neocortex. And so that I think helps you form new memories, but it also helps you, I think, stabilize them, but also really connect different things together in memory. And allows you to build bridges between different events that you've had. And so this is one of at least our theories of sleep, and its real role in helping you see the connections between different events that you've experienced.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So during sleep is when the connections are formed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The connections between different events, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's like you see me now, you see me next week, you see me a month later. You start to build a little internal model of how I behave and what to expect of me. And we think sleep, one of the things it allows you to do is figure out those connections and connect the dots and find the signal in the noise.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned fMRI. What is it? And how is it used in studying memory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>than blood that does because you have hemoglobin that carries the oxygen, the iron basically in the blood that makes it red. And so that hemoglobin, when it's deoxygenated actually has different magnetic field properties than when it has oxygen. And it turns out when you have an increase in local activity in some part of the brain, the blood flows there. And as a result you get a lower concentration of hemoglobin that is not oxygenated, and then that gives you more signal. So I gave you, I think I sent you a GIF, as you like to say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we had off-record intense argument about if it's pronounced GIF or GIF, but we shall set that aside as friends.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We could have called it a stern rebuke perhaps, but...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Rebuke, yeah. I drew a hard line, it is true the creator of GIF said it's pronounced GIF, but that's the only person that pronounces GIF. Anyway, yes, you sent a GIF of...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>start to get a whole state space of how a brain area is indexing all these different memories. It's super fascinating because what we could see is this little separation between how certain brain areas are processing memory for who was there. And other brain areas are processing information about where it occurred, or the situation that's kind of unfolding. And some are giving you information about what are my goals that are involved and so forth. And the hippocampus is just putting it all together into these unique things that just are of about when and where it happened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a separation between spatial information concepts, literally there's distinct, as you said, QR codes for these?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So to speak. Let me try a different analogy too, that might be more accessible for people. Which would be, you've got a folder on your computer, right? I open it up, there's a bunch of files there. I can sort those files by alphabetical order. And now things that both start with letter A are lumped together, and things that start with Z versus A are far apart, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them at two different cafes and two different supermarkets. And what you could show is in one particular network, you could find the same kind of pattern of activity, more or less, a very similar pattern of activity. Every time I saw Alex in one of these movies, no matter where he was, right? And I could see another one that was a common pattern that happened every time I saw this particular supermarket nugget. And it didn't matter whether you're watching a movie or whether you're recalling the movie, it's the same kind of pattern that comes up, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is fascinating. And so now you have those building blocks for assembling a model of what's happening in the present, imagining what could happen, and remembering things very economically from putting together all these pieces. So that all the hippocampus has to do is get the right kind of blueprint for how to put together all these building blocks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>These are all beautiful hints at a super interesting system that makes me wonder on the other side of it how to build it. But it's fascinating the way it does the encoding is really, really fascinating. Or I guess the symptoms, the results of that encoding are fascinating to study from this. Just as a small tangent, you mentioned sort of the measuring local potentials with electrodes versus fMRI.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some interesting limitations, possibilities of fMRI? The way you explained it is brilliant with blood and detecting the activations or the excitation because blood flows to that area. What's the latency of that? What's the blood dynamics in the brain that... How quickly can the tasks change and all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back into the neuron so that you could reuse it. But that cycling is actually very energy intensive. And what's interesting is at least according to one theory, they need to work so quickly that they're working on metabolizing the glucose that comes in without using oxygen. Kind of like anaerobic metabolism, so they're not using oxygen as fast as they're using glucose. So what we're really seeing in some ways may be in fMRI, not the neurons themselves being active, but rather the astrocytes which are meeting the metabolic demands of the process of keeping the whole system going.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It does seem to be that fMRI is a good way to study activation. So with these astrocytes, even though there's a latency, it's pretty reliably coupled to the activations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the magnetic field stable in those spots. You'll see parts where it's like there's a vein, and so it just produces big increase and decrease in signal or respiration that causes these changes. There's lots of artifacts and stuff like that. Every technique has its limits. If I'm lying down in an MRI scanner, I'm lying down. I'm not interacting with you in the same way that I would in the real world. But at the same time, I'm getting data that I might not be able to get otherwise. And so different techniques give you different kinds of advantages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What kind of big scientific discoveries, maybe the flavor of discoveries have been done throughout the history of the science of memory, the studying of memory? What kind of things have been understood?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Oh my God, this is really interesting. How did we do all this stuff?\" I would say that some of the... From the first study, it's just showing how much we forget is very important. Showing how much schemas, which is our organized knowledge about the world increase our ability to remember information, just massively increase in [inaudible 01:29:25] of expertise. Showing how experts like chess experts can memorize so much in such a short amount of time because of the schemas they have for chess. But then also showing that those lead to all sorts of distortions in memory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The discovery that the act of remembering can change the memory, it can strengthen it, but it can also distort it if you get misinformation at the time. And it can also strengthen or weaken other memories that you didn't even recall. So just this whole idea of memory as an ecosystem I think was a big discovery. I could go, this idea of breaking up our continuous experience into these discrete events, I think was a major discovery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the discreetness of our encoding of events?<|eot_id|>"}

I can get a person with epilepsy who we have electrodes in their brain anyway, to try to figure out where the seizures are coming from. And if it's a healthy part of the brain, record from that person, right? And I can get a computational model. And one of the brand new members in my lab, Tyler Brown is just doing some great stuff. He relates computer vision models and looks at the weaknesses of computer vision models and relates to what the brain does well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>different species, and in the computational model. Which is I just find that mind-blowing. And you could do different kinds of analyses on language and basically come up with... Basically it's the guts of LLMs, right? You could do analyses on language and you could do analyses on sentiment analyses of emotions and so forth. Put all this stuff together, it's almost too much. But if you do it right and you do it in a theory-driven way as opposed to just throwing all the data at the wall and see what sticks, that to me is just exceptionally powerful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can take fMRI data across species and across different types of humans or conditions of humans, and construct models that help you find the commonalities or the core thing that makes somebody navigate through the metaverse, for example?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah, more or less. There's a lot of details, but yes, I think... And not just fMRI, but you can relate it to, like I said, recordings from large populations of neurons that could be taken in a human or even in a non-human animal, that is where you think it's an anatomical homologue. So that's just mind-blowing to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the similarities in humans and mice? That's what Smashing Pumpkins, we're all just rats in a cage.

There's language, there's... you name it, there's obviously gobs of differences. Humans aren't just giant rats. There's much more complexity to us. Timescales are very important. So, primate brains and human brains are especially good at integrating and holding on to information across longer and longer periods of time. Also, finally, it's like our history of training data, so to speak, is very, very different than... Human's world is very different than a wild mouse's world. And a lab mouse's world is extraordinarily impoverished relative to an adult human. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But still, what can you understand by studying mice?

There's a lot that can be learned from non-human primates. And then there's a lot that you need to learn from humans. And I think unfortunately, some of the people in the National Institutes of Health think you can learn everything from the mouse. It's like, \"Why study memory in humans when I could study learning in a mouse?\" And just like, \"Oh my God, I'm going to get my funding from somewhere else.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let me ask you some random fascinating question.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How does deja vu work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to necessarily give you deja vu, even for very mundane things. So, it's like if I tell you the word rutabaga, your brain's going to work a little bit harder to catch it than if I give you word like apple. That's because you hear apple a lot. So, your brain's very tuned up to process it efficiently, but rutabaga takes a little bit longer and more intense. And you can actually see a difference in brain activity in areas in the temporal lobe when you hear a word just based on how frequent it is in the English language.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We think it's tied to this basic... It's basically a by-product of our mechanism of just learning, doing this error-driven learning as we go through life to become better and better and better to process things more and more efficiently.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, I guess deja vu is just thinking extra elevated, the stuff coming together, firing for this artificial memories, as if it's the real memory. I mean, why does it feel so intense?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it doesn't happen all the time, but I think what may be happening is it's a partial match to something that we have, and it's not enough to trigger that sense of... that ability to pull together all the pieces. But it's a close enough match to give you that intense sense of familiarity, without the recollection of exactly what happened when.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's also a spatio-temporal familiarity. So, it's also in time. There's a weird blending of time that happens, and we'll probably talk about time because I think that's a really interesting idea how time relates to memory. But you also kind of... Artificial memory brings to mind this idea of false memories that comes in all kinds of contexts. But how do false memories form?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>lab too, or a significant... not everybody, but a chunk of people will fall for this, where you can give people misinformation about an event that never took place. And as they keep trying to remember that event more and more, what happens is they start to imagine, they start to pull up things from other experiences they've had, and eventually they can stitch together a vivid memory of something that never happened because they're not remembering an event that happened. They're remembering the act of trying to remember what happened, and basically putting it together into the wrong story.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's fascinating because this could probably happen at a collective level. This is probably what successful propaganda machines aim to do, this creating false memory across thousands, if not millions of minds.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>maybe it was something about illegitimate children or... I don't really remember. But they included misinformation in the question that they asked, \"How do you feel about the fact that he wants to do this?\" Or something. And so people would end up becoming convinced he had these policy things or these personal things that were not true, just based on the polls that were being used. So, it was a case where, interestingly enough, the people who were using misinformation were actually ahead of the curve relative to the scientists who were trying to study these effects in memory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's really interesting. So, it's not just about truth and falsehoods, like us as intelligent, reasoning machines, but it's the formation of memories where they become visceral. You can rewrite history. If you just look throughout the 20th century, some of the dictatorships with Nazi Germany, with the Soviet Union, effective propaganda machines can rewrite our conceptions of history, how we remember our own culture, our upbringing, all this kind of stuff. And you could do quite a lot of damage in this way. And then there's probably some kind of social contagion happening there. Certain ideas that, maybe initiated by the propaganda machine, can spread faster than others. You could see that in modern day, certain conspiracy theories, there's just something about them that they are really effective at spreading. There's something sexy about them to people to where something about the human mind eats it up and then uses that to construct memories as if they almost were there to witness whatever the content of the conspiracy theory is. It's fascinating. Because you feel like you remember a thing, I feel like there's a certainty. It emboldens you to say stuff. It's not just you believe in ideas, true or not, it's at the core of your being that you feel like you were there to watch the thing happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>their unique contribution, you get more accurate memories and you get more information from it. Even two people who come from very similar backgrounds, if you can appreciate the unique contributions that each one has, you can do a better job of generating information from memory. And that's a way to inoculate ourselves, I believe, from misinformation in the modern world. But like everything else, it requires a certain tolerance for discomfort. And I think when we don't have much time, and I think when we're stressed out and when we are just tired, it's very hard to tolerate discomfort.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I mean, social media has a lot of opportunity for this because it enables this distributed one-on-one interaction that you're talking about, where everybody has a voice, but still our natural inclination, you see this on social media, as there's a natural clustering of people and opinions and you just form these kind of bubbles. To me personally, I think that's a technology problem that could be solved if there's a little bit of interaction, kind, respectful, compassionate interaction with people that have a very different memory, that respectful interaction will start to intermix the memories and ways of thinking to where you're slowly moving towards truth. But that's a technology problem because naturally, left our own devices, we want to cluster up in a tribe.<|eot_id|>"}

So, humans have this capability to be so much more creative than anything generative AI will put together, at least right now, who knows where this goes?

But when you look at the long arc of history across the years and decades, has humanity been flourishing? Are humans creating more awesome stuff, are humans happier? All that kind of stuff.

The question is, in terms of every single problem they've had, is now solved. There's now food, there's guaranteed survival, and shelter and all this kind of stuff. So, what you're asking is a deeper sort of biological question, do we want to be... Werner Herzog and the movie Happy People: Life in the Taiga, do we want to be busy 100% of our time hunting, gathering, surviving, worried about the next day? Maybe that constant struggle ultimately creates a more fulfilling life. I don't know. But I do know this modern society allows us to, when we're sick, to find medicine, to find cures, when we're hungry, to get food, much more than we did even a hundred years ago. And there's many more activities that you could perform, all creative, all these kinds of stuff that enables the flourishing of humans at the individual level. Whether that leads to happiness, I mean, that's a very deep philosophical question. Maybe struggle, deep struggle is necessary for happiness.<|eot_id|>"}

There are definitely stories out there like this where people confess to crimes that they just didn't do, and- ... out there like this, where people confess to crimes that they just didn't do and objective evidence came out later on. There's a basic recipe for it, which is you feed people the information that you want them to remember, you stress them out.

He says the worst part is forgetting it. It is actually when you get over the heartbreak, that's the worst part. I sometimes think about that because having the love and losing it, the losing it is when you sometimes feel it the deepest, which is an interesting way to celebrate the past and relive it. It sucks that you don't have a thing, but when you don't have a thing, it's a good moment to viscerally experience the memories of something that you now appreciate even more.<|eot_id|>"}

They talked about how do you renounce attachments to the people that you love? They're just saying, \"Well, I appreciate that I have this moment with them and knowing that they will die makes me appreciate this moment that much more.\" You said something similar in your daily routine that you think about things this way, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I meditate on mortality every day, but I don't know, at the same time, that really makes you appreciate the moment and live in the moment.

That week went by during the same amount of time as an eventful week where you might've been going out hanging out with friends on vacation or whatever. It's just that nothing happened because you're doing the same thing over and over.

There's certain markers that let you know that time has passed, you celebrate birthdays and so on, but the core of who I am and who others I know are, or events, that compression of my understanding of the world removes time because time is not useful for the compression.

Let's start with a more practical one. What are your thoughts about BCIs, brain computer interfaces, and the work that's going on with Neuralink? We talked about electrodes and different ways of measuring the brain, and here Neuralink is working on basically two-way communication with the brain. The more out there question will be like, where's this go? More practically in the near term, what do you think about Neuralink?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just so much innovation happening. I think the interesting question which we may be getting into is, I was talking to Sergey a while ago about a lot of language is not just what we hear and what we speak, but also our intentions and our internal models. And so, are you really going to be able to restore language without dealing with that part of it? He brought up a really interesting question, which is the ethics of reading out people's intentions and understanding of the world as opposed to the more concrete parts of hearing and producing movements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just so we're clear, because you said a few interesting things, when we talk about language and BCIs, what we mean is getting signal from the brain and generating the language, say you're not able to actually speak, it's as a kind of linguistic prosthetic. It's able to speak for you exactly what you want it to say. Then the deeper question is, well, saying something isn't just the letters, the words that you're saying, it's also the intention behind it, the feeling behind all that kind of stuff. Is it ethical to reveal that full shebang, the full context of what's going on in our brain? That's really interesting. That's really interesting. Our thoughts, is it ethical for anyone to have access to our thoughts? Because right now the resolution is so low that we're okay with it, even doing studies and all this kind of stuff. If neuroscience has a few breakthroughs to where you can start to map out the QR codes for different thoughts, for different kinds of thoughts, maybe political thoughts, the McCarthyism, what if I'm getting a lot of them communist thoughts, or however we want to categorize or label it? That's interesting. That's really interesting. I think ultimately this always... The more transparency there is about the human mind, the better it is. There could be always intermediate battles with how much control does a centralized entity have, like a government and so on. What is the regulation? What are the rules? What's legal and illegal? If you talk about the police, whose job is to track down criminals and so on, and you look at all the history, how the police could abuse its power to control the citizenry, all that kind of stuff. People are always paranoid and rightfully so. It's fascinating. It's really fascinating. We talk about freedom of speech, freedom of thought, which is also a very important liberty at the core of this country and probably humanity. It starts to get awfully tricky when you start to be able to collect those thoughts. What I wanted to actually ask you is do you think for fun and for practical purposes, we would be able to modify memories? How far away we are from understanding the different parts of the brains, everything we've been talking about, in order to figure out how can we adjust this memory at the crude level from unpleasant to pleasant? You talked about we can remember the mall and the location, the people. Can we keep the people and change the place? This kind of stuff, how difficult is that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In some sense we know we can do it, just behaviorally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Behaviorally, yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>saw somebody talking in this discussion between neuroscientists and AI people, and he was saying that the problem with self-driving cars that they had in cities as opposed to highways was that the car was okay at doing the things it's supposed to, but when there were pedestrians around, it couldn't predict the intentions of people. And so, that unpredictability of people was the problem that they were having in the self-driving car design. It didn't have a good enough internal model of what the people were, what they were doing, what they wanted. What do you think about that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I spent a huge amount of time watching pedestrians, thinking about pedestrians, thinking about what it takes to solve the problem of measuring, detecting the intention of a pedestrian, really, of a human being in this particular context of having to cross the street. It's fascinating. I think it's a window into how complex social systems are that involve humans. I would just stand there and watch intersections for hours. What you start to figure out is every single intersection has its own personality. There's a history to that intersection, like jaywalking, certain intersections allow jaywalking a lot more because what happens is we're leaders and followers, so there's a regular, let's say, and they get off the subway and they start crossing on a red light, and they do this every single day. Then there's people that don't show up to that intersection often, and they're looking for cues of how we're supposed to behave here. If a few people start to jaywalk and cross on a red light, they will also. They will follow. There's just a dynamic to that intersection. There's a spirit to it. If you look at Boston versus New York versus a rural town versus even Boston, San Francisco or here in Austin, there's different personalities city-wide, but there's different personalities area-wise, region-wise, and there's different personalities at different intersections. It's just fascinating. For a car to be able to determine that, it's tricky. Now, what machine learning systems are able to do well is collect a huge amount of data. For us, it's tricky because we get to understand the world with very limited information and make decisions grounded in this big foundation model that we've built of understanding how humans work. AI could literally, in the context of driving, this is where I've often been really torn in both directions. If you just collect a huge amount of data, all of that information, and then compress it into a representation of how humans cross streets, it's probably all there. In the same way that you have a Noam Chomsky who says, \"No, no, no, AI can't talk, can't write convincing language without understanding language.\" More and more you see large language models without \"understanding\" can generate very convincing language. I think what the process of compression from a huge amount of data compressing into a representation is doing is in fact understanding deeply. In order to be able to generate one letter at a time, one word at a time, you have to understand the cruelty of Nazi Germany and the beauty of sending humans to space. You have to understand all of that in order to generate, \"I'm going to the kitchen to get an apple,\" and do that grammatically correctly. You have to have a world model that includes all of human behavior.<|eot_id|>"}

In the same way, I think AI that drives a car, if it has enough data, will be able to form a world model that will be able to predict correctly what a pedestrian does. When we as humans are watching pedestrians, we slowly realize, damn, this is really complicated. In fact, when you start to self-reflect on driving, you realize driving is really complicated. There's subtle cues we take about just... This is a million things I could say, but one of them, determining who around you is an asshole, aggressive driver, potentially dangerous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, I was just thinking about this. Yes. You can read it a mile...

Because we're ignoring all the other cars, but for some reason, the asshole, like a glowing obvious symbol is just right there, even in the periphery vision because again, we're usually when we're driving just looking forward, but we're using the periphery vision to figure stuff out. It's a little puzzle that we're usually only allocating a small amount of our attention to, at least cognitive attention to. It's fascinating, but I think AI just has a fundamentally different suite of sensors in terms of the bandwidth of data that's coming in that allows you to form the representation that perform inference on using the representation you form. For the case of driving, I think it could be quite effective. One of the things that's currently missing, even though OpenAI just recently announced adding memory, and I did want to ask you how important it is, how difficult is it to add some of the memory mechanisms that you've seen in humans to AI systems?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's like, and then there's the problem of how do you even build the motivations that should guide a proper reinforcement learning kind of thing, for instance. So a friend of mine, Sam Gershman, I might be missing the quote exactly, but he basically said, \"If I wanted to train a typical AI model to make me as much money as possible, first thing I might do is sell my house.\" So it's not even just about having one goal or one objective, but just having all these competing goals and objectives, and then things start to get really complicated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's all interconnected. I mean, just even the thing you've mentioned is the moment, if we record a moment, it is difficult to express concretely what a moment is, how deeply connected it's to the entirety of it. Maybe to record a moment, you have to make a universe from scratch. You have to include everything. You have to include all the emotions involved, all the context, all the things that built around it, all the social connections, all the visual experiences, all the sensory experience, all of that, all the history that came before that moment is built on. And we somehow take all of that and we compress it, and keep the useful parts and then integrate it into the whole thing, into our whole narrative. And then each individual has their own little version of that narrative, and then we collide in a social way, and we adjust it. And we evolve.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm grabbing little points on the screen by moving my eyes around, and getting a very high resolution picture of what I'm focusing on, and kind of a lower resolution information about everything else. But I'm not necessarily choosing, but I'm directing that exploration, and allowing people to move their eyes and integrate that information gave them something that the computer vision models weren't able to do. So somehow integrating information across time and getting less information at each step gave you more out of the process.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The process of allocating attention across time seems to be a really important process. Even the breakthroughs that you get with machine learning mostly has to do attention is all you need, is about attention. Transform is about attention. So attention is a really interesting one. But then, yeah, how you allocate that attention, again is at the core of what it means to be intelligent, what it means to process the world, integrate all the important things, discard all the unimportant things. Attention is at the core of it, it's probably at the core of memory too. There's so much sensory information. There's so much going on, there's so much going on. To filter it down to almost nothing and just keep those parts, and to keep those parts, and then whenever there's an error to adjust the model, such that you can allocate attention even better to new things that would resolve, maybe maximize the chance of confirming the model, or disconfirming the model that you have, and adjusting it since then. Yeah, attention is a weird one. I was always fascinated. I mean, I got a chance to study peripheral vision for a bit and indirectly study attention through that.

So what I'm trying to do is set aside a timer. This is my email time, this is my writing time, this is my goofing off time. And so, blocking these things off, you give yourself the goofing off time. Sometimes I do that and sometimes I have to be flexible, and go like, okay, I'm definitely not focusing. I'm going to give myself the down time, and it's an investment. It's not like wasting time. It's an investment in my attention later on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I'm very much with Cal Newport on this. He wrote Deep Work and a lot of other amazing books. He talks about task switching as the thing that really destroys productivity. So switching, it doesn't even matter from what to what, but checking social media, checking email, maybe switching to a phone call, and then doing work and then switching. Even switching between if you're reading a paper, switching from paper to paper to paper, because curiosity and whatever the dopamine hit from the attention switch, limiting that, because otherwise your brain is just not capable to really load it in, and really do that deep deliberation I think that's required to remember things, and to really think through things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of vanished, because what happens, I'm creating all these artificial event boundaries. I'm losing all this executive function every time I switch, I'm getting a few seconds slower and I'm catching up mentally to what's happening. And so, instead of being in a model where you're meaningfully integrating everything and predicting and generating this kind of rich model, I'm just catching up. And so yeah, there's great research by Melina Uncapher and Anthony Wagner on multitasking, that people can look up that talks about just how bad it is for memory, and it's becoming worse and worse of a problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're a musician. Take me through how'd you get into music? What made you first fall in love with music, with creating music?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I started playing music just when I was doing trumpet in school for school band. And I would just read music and play, and it was pretty decent at it, not great, but I was decent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You go from trumpet to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Guitar?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... to guitar, especially the kind of music you're into.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it go back and forth, we make it a circle, or what if we make it a straight line, or zigzag, just make it nonlinear in these interesting ways? And then next thing you know, it's the whole world sort of opens up as, and then what I started to realize, especially so you could appreciate this as a musician, I think. So time signatures. So we are so brainwashed to think in four-four, right? Every rock song you could think of almost is in four-four. I know you're a Floyd fan, So think of Money by Pink Floyd, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You feel like it's in four-four, because it resolves itself, but it resolves on the last note of... Basically it resolves on the first note of the next measure. So it's got seven beats instead of eight where the riff is actually happening.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you're thinking in four, because that's how we are used to thinking. So the music flows a little bit faster than it's supposed to, and you're getting a little bit of prediction error every time this is happening. And once I got used to that, I was like, I hate writing at four-four, because I was like, everything just feels better if I do it in seven-four, if I alternate between four and three, and doing all this stuff. And then it's like jazz music is like that. They just do so much interesting stuff with this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So playing with those time signatures allows you to really break it all open and just, I guess there's something about that where it allows you to actually have fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and so I'm actually very, one of the genres we used to play in was Math Rock, is what they called it. It was just like, this is so many weird time signatures.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is math rock? Oh, interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the math part of rock is what, the mathematical disturbances of it or what?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I guess it would be. So instead of might go, instead of playing four beats in every measure, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. You go, na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na-na, and just do these things. And then you might arrange it in weird ways so that there might be three measures of verse, and then five measures of chorus, and then two measures. So you could just mess around with everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does that feel like to listen to? There's something about symmetry or patterns that feel good and relaxing for us or whatever, it feels like home. And disturbing that can be quite disturbing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So is that the feeling you would have if you keep messing math rock? I mean-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... that's stressing me out just listening, learning about it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a high tolerance for that kind of dissonance and prediction. I think I have a theory, a pet theory, that it's like basically you can explain most of human behavior as some people are lumpers and some people are splitters. And so, it's like some people are very kind of excited when they get this dissonance and they want to go with it. Some people are just like, \"No, I want to lump everything.\" I don't know, maybe that's even a different thing, but it's basically, it's like I think some people get scared of that discomfort, and I really-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thrive on it. I love it. What's the name of your band now?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The cover band I play in is a band called Pavlov's Dogs. It's a band, unsurprisingly, of mostly memory researchers, neuroscientists.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love this. I love this so much.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, actually one of your MIT colleagues, Earl Miller plays bass.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Plays bass. Do you play rhythm or leader?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You could compete if you want. Maybe we could audition you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For audition. Oh yeah, I'm coming for you, Earl.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Earl's going to kill me. He's very precise though.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'll play triangle or something. Or we're the cowbell. Yeah, I'll be the cowbell guy. What kind of songs do you guys do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's mostly late '70s punk and '80s New Wave and post-punk. Blondie, Ramones, Clash. I sing Age of Consent by New Order and Love Will Tear Us Apart-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you have a female singer now?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Carrie Hoffman and also Paula Crocks. And so, yeah, so Carrie does Blondie amazingly well, and we do Gigantic by the Pixies. Paula does that one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which song do you love to play the most? What kind of song is super fun for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of someone else's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Cover. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Cover. Okay. And it's one we do with Pavlov's Dogs. I really enjoy playing. I Want To Be Your Dog by Iggy and the Stooges.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good song.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, Iggy in the Stooges, that song, so I play and sing on it, but it's just like it devolves into total noise, and I just fall on the floor and generate feedback. I think in the last version, it might've been that, or a Velvet Underground cover in our last show, I actually, I have a guitar made of aluminum that I got made, and I thought this thing's indestructible. So I was just moving it around, had it upside down and all this stuff to generate feedback. And I think I broke one of the tuning pegs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I managed, I've managed to break an all metal guitar. Go figure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A bit of a big ridiculous question, but let me ask you. We've been talking about neuroscience in general. You've been studying the human mind for a long time. What do you love most about the human mind? Like, when you look at it, we look at the fMRI, just the scans and the behavioral stuff, the electrodes, the psychology aspect, reading the literature on the biology side, in your biology, all of it. When you look at it, what is most beautiful to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this dark energy that's holding that whole universe of your mind together. And without that, it's just a bunch of stuff. And somehow we put that together and it forms so much of our experience, and being able to figure out where that comes from and how things are connected to me is just amazing. But just this idea of the world in front of us, we're only sampling this little bit and trying to take so much meaning from it, and we do a really good job. Not perfect, I mean, but that ability to me is just amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's an incredible mystery, all of it. It's funny you said dark energy, because the same in astrophysics. You look out there, you look at dark matter and dark energy, which is this loose term assigned to a thing we don't understand, which helps make the equations work in terms of gravity and the expansion of the universe. In the same way, it seems like there's that kind of thing in the human mind that we're striving to understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think that people didn't get was the uncertainty of science and how much we don't know. And I think every scientist lives in this world of uncertainty, and when I was writing the book, I just became aware of all of these things we don't know. And so, I think of physics a lot. I think of this idea of overwhelming majority of the stuff that's in our universe cannot be directly measured. I used to think, I hate physics. Physicists get the Nobel Prize for doing whatever stupid thing. It's like there's 10 physicists out there. I'm just kidding.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just strong words.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, no, no, no, I'm just kidding. The physicists who do neuroscience could be rather opinionated. So sometimes I like to dish on that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's all love.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and have a bead on it and be able to go towards it, that's one of the biggest scientific successes that I could think of. You are aware that you don't know about this gigantic section, overwhelming majority of the universe. And I think the more what keeps me going to some extent is realizing changing the scope of the problem, and figuring out, oh my God, there's all these things we don't know. And I thought I knew this, because science is all about assumptions, right? So have you ever read The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's my only philosophy really, that I've read. But it's so brilliant in the way that they frame this idea of, he frames this idea of assumptions being core to the scientific process, and the paradigm shift comes from changing those assumptions, and this idea of finding out this whole zone of what you don't know to me is the exciting part.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you are a great scientist and you wrote an incredible book, so thank you for doing that. And thank you for talking today. You've decreased the amount of uncertainty I have just a tiny little bit today and reveal the beauty of memory, this fascinating conversation. Thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, thank you. It has been blast.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Charan Raganath. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Haruki Murakami. Most things are forgotten over time, even the war itself, the life and death struggle people went through is now like something from the distant past. We're so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things who can never assign to oblivion, memories who can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone. Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
