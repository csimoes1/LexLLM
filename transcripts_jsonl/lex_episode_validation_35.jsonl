He created the documentary that I highly recommend called This Place Rules, on the undercurrents that led to the January 6th Capitol riots. This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What have you learned from those guys, the UFOlogists?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>one question that I want to reverse on you because you've talked to so many people. Do you think that aliens have actually visited earth?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>When?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exact dates? I think there's alien civilizations everywhere. I talk to a lot of people that have doubts about it. I just think I even suspect there's an intelligent alien civilization in our galaxy and I just can't imagine them not having visited us. So I lean on that. What that actually looks like, I don't know. The stuff we're seeing in terms of UFO sightings, I think to the degree it's real, it's much more likely government projects. So military, Lockheed Martin, this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you think that they have knowledge of it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

But who's to say that they're not able to shrink down to microscopic size with the same neural capacity?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Or just have a very difficult to perceive form.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But they would go small, not big.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, I think that would take a humanoid-like form just to be able to communicate with humans. I think that the big challenge with aliens is to be able to find a common language. So if you come to another planet and you suspect that there's some kind of complexity going on, but it looks nothing like humans, you have to find a common language. And I think aliens would try to take physical form that's similar that us dumb humans would understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time on here, but I'm really interested in endangered languages in the US. There's like 150 languages in the US with less than 1,000 speakers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I want to help spearhead efforts to preserve some of these. For example, Hawaiian Sign language, 15 of those people left.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Holy shit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>isolation. That's being threatened by golf course developments. I don't know how into language you are, but I've been getting super nerded out about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually, I'm interviewing somebody tomorrow who's an expert in human language. He's from MIT, studying the syntax of a lot of languages, including in the Amazon jungle, the peoples that live in the Amazon jungle region. Yeah, it's fascinating. Human language is fascinating, and also the barriers that creates, and also how the games are played, to what you're speaking, by governments. This is part of the story of Russia, and Ukraine, is a battle over language. The Ukrainian language is a symbol of independence, which is why they were trying to make it the primary language of the nation. And so sometimes the language represents the culture and the peoples, and it's intricately tied to the culture of the people.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>selfish as well, but I don't think that selfish is inherently bad.
