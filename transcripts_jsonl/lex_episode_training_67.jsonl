It's my birthday, so this is a special birthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just to wish me a happy birthday, and we decided to do a podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand and a long time after late into the night. He's one of my favorite human beings, brilliant scientists, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend. I'm grateful for Andrew. I'm grateful for good friends, for all the support and love I've gotten over the past few years. I'm truly grateful for this life, for the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours. I really don't want to leave just yet. I think I'd really like to stick around. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.<|eot_id|>"}

So it's hyperextend the knee in that direction, they got knee barred pretty hard. So in ways I don't understand, it kind of hurts to run. I don't understand what's happening behind there. I need to investigate this. Basically the hamstringing flex, like curling, your leg hurts a little bit, and that results in this weird, dull, but sometimes extremely sharp pain in the back of the knee. So I'm working through this anyway, but walking doesn't hurt. So I've been playing around with walking recently for two hours and thinking because I know a lot of smart people throughout history, I have walked and thought, and you have to play with things that have worked for others, not just to exercise, but to integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise into a productive life. So they do all their thinking while they walk. It's like a meditative type of walking, and it's really interesting. It really works.<|eot_id|>"}

Once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this? Is this who you are fundamentally, and it will always be this way, or is this a problem to be fixed? For example, one of the things, especially recently, but in general over time I've discovered about myself probably has roots in childhood, probably has roots in a lot of things, is I deeply value loyalty maybe more than the average person. And so when there's disloyalty, it can be painful to me. And so this is who I am, and so do I have to relax a bit? Do I have to fix this part or is this who you are?

And I'm with you and you and I very much have the same values on this, but that's one little thing. And then there's many other things like I'm extremely self-critical and I look at myself as I'm regularly very self-critical, a self-critical engine in my brain. And I talked to actually Paul about this, I think on the podcast quite a bit. And he's saying, \"This is a really bad thing. You need to fix this. You need to be able to be regularly very positive about yourself.\" And I kept disagreeing with him, \"No, this is who I am,\" and he seems to work. Don't mess with a thing that seems to be working. It's fine. I oscillate between being really grateful and really self-critical. But then you have to figure out what is it? Maybe there's a deeper root thing. Maybe there's an insecurity in there somewhere that has to do with childhood and then you're trying to prove something to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing.<|eot_id|>"}

And I think you put it really beautifully. You have to figure out, given who you are, the various characteristics of your mind, all the things, all the contents of the cupboards, how to get space from it.

And the Coliseum is for 400 years, there's so much great writing about this, I think over 400,000 people have died in the Coliseum, gladiators. So this is this historic place that sheds so much blood, so much fear, so much anticipation of battle, all of this. So he loves this kind of spectacle and also, the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it.

So Life in Color is a series on Netflix where it presents some of the most colorful animals on earth, and tells their story of how they got there through natural selection. So you have the peacock with the feathers and it's just such incredible colors. The peacock has these tail feathers, the male, that are gigantic and they're super colorful and they're these eyes on it. It's not eyes, it's eye-like areas.

The other project, I've been working on for at least a year off and on, but trying to finish is something we've talked about in the past. I'm still on it, project on Hitler in World War II.
