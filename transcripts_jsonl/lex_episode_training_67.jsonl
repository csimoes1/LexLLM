{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Listen, when it comes to romantic relationships, if it's not a 100% in you, it ain't happening. And I've never seen a violation of that statement where it's like, \"Yeah, it's mostly good.\" And this is like the negotiations, already it's doomed. And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect. The relationship has to be perfect, but it's got to feel a 100% inside, like yes, yes, and yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with my dear friend Andrew Huberman, his fourth time on this podcast. It's my birthday, so this is a special birthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just to wish me a happy birthday, and we decided to do a podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand and a long time after late into the night. He's one of my favorite human beings, brilliant scientists, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend. I'm grateful for Andrew. I'm grateful for good friends, for all the support and love I've gotten over the past few years. I'm truly grateful for this life, for the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours. I really don't want to leave just yet. I think I'd really like to stick around. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm trying to run a little bit more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you losing weight?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>also started training with lighter weights and higher repetitions and for three month cycles, and it gives your joints a rest. Yeah, so I think it also is interesting to see how training differently changes your cognition. That's probably hormone related, hormones downstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter. I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges are a little bit or higher, which is not to say that people who lift heavy are dumb, but there is a... Because there's real value in lifting heavy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of angry people listening to this right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and then taking three to five minutes rest is far and away a different challenge than running hard for 90 minutes. That's a tough thing, just like getting in an ice bath. People say, \"Oh, well, how is that any different than working out?\" Well, there are a lot of differences, but one of them is that it's very acute stress, within one second you're stressed. So I think subjecting the body to a bunch of different types of stressors in space and time is really valuable. So yeah, I've been playing with the variables in a pre systematic way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I like long and slow like you said, the impact it has on my cognition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the wordlessness of it, the way it seems to clean out the clutter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It can take away that hyperfocus and put you more in a relaxed focus for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, for me, it brings the clutter to the surface at first. Like all these thoughts come in there, and then they dissipate. I got knee barred pretty hard. That's when somebody tries to break your knee.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What a knee bar? They try and break your knee?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, so you tap so they-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. So it's hyperextend the knee in that direction, they got knee barred pretty hard. So in ways I don't understand, it kind of hurts to run. I don't understand what's happening behind there. I need to investigate this. Basically the hamstringing flex, like curling, your leg hurts a little bit, and that results in this weird, dull, but sometimes extremely sharp pain in the back of the knee. So I'm working through this anyway, but walking doesn't hurt. So I've been playing around with walking recently for two hours and thinking because I know a lot of smart people throughout history, I have walked and thought, and you have to play with things that have worked for others, not just to exercise, but to integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise into a productive life. So they do all their thinking while they walk. It's like a meditative type of walking, and it's really interesting. It really works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The practice I've been doing a lot more of lately is I walk while reading a book in the yard.

And he walks in, voice dictates his papers. And now with Rev or these other, maybe there are better ones than Rev, where you can convert audio files into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate first drafts and things like that. And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, the integrating that with cognitive work, harder to do with sprints and then the gym.

You and Jocko and Costello have these wrists and elbows that are super thick. And then when you look around, you see tremendous variation. Some people have the wrist width of a Whippet or Woody Allen, and then other people like you or Jocko. There's this one Jocko video or thing on GQ or something.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>teens, my twenties, my thirties, I'm almost 48, I'll be 48 next month. I didn't trust, I didn't listen. I actually put a lot of work into overriding those signals and learning to fight through them, thinking that somehow that was making me tougher or somehow that was making me smarter. When in fact, in the end, those people that you meet that are difficult or there are other names for it, like in the end, you're like, \"That person's a piece of shit,\" or, \"This person is amazing and they're really wonderful.\" And I felt that from the go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've learned to trust your gut versus the influences of other people's opinions?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've learned to trust my gut versus the forebrain over analysis, overriding the gut. Other people often in my life have had great optics. I've benefited tremendously from an early age of being in a large community. It's been mostly guys, but I have some close female friends and always have as well who will tell me, \"That's a bad decision,\" or, \"This person not so good,\" or, \"Be careful,\" or, \"They're great,\" or, \"That's great.\" So oftentimes my community and the people around me have been more aligned with the correct choice than not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it really?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Really? When you were younger like friends, parents and so on.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But Paul's level of insight into the human psyche is absolutely astounding. And he says the opposite of what most people say about the brain, which is most people say, \"Oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain.\" It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there. And the forebrain is what makes us human and gives us our superpowers. Paul has said, and he's done a whole series on mental health that's coming out from our podcast in September, so this is not an attempt to plug that, but he'll elaborate on [inaudible 00:13:08].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, you're doing a thing with Paul?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We already did. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>our feelings and what we think are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully. And that only by exploring the subconscious and understanding it a little bit, can we actually improve ourselves over time and I agree. I think that so the mistake is to think that thinking can override it all. It's a certain style of introspection and thinking that allows us to read the signals from our body, read the signals from our brain, integrate the knowledge that we're collecting about ourselves, and to use all that in ways that are really adaptive and generative for us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is there in that subconscious? What do you think of the Jungian and shadow? What's there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like I assumed all scientists do, certainly why I went into it. But some people, it's just raw ambition. It's about winning. It doesn't even matter what they win, which to me is crazy. But I think that's a shadow that some people explore, not one I've explored. I think the shadow parts of us are very important to come to understand and look better to understand them and know that they're there and work with them than to not acknowledge their presence and have them surface in the form of addictions or behaviors that damage us in other people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the processes for achieving mental health is to bring those things to the surface. So fish the subconscious mind.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as going to the gym and people think it's just ruminating on problems, or getting... No, no, no. If you work with somebody really good, they're forcing you to ask questions about who you really are, what you really want. It's not just about support, but there should be support. There should be rapport, but then it's also, there should be insight, right? Most people who get therapy, they're getting support, there's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at, and a really good psychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insights that transform your entire life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, sometimes when I look inside and I do this often exploring who you truly are, you come to this question, do I accept... Once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this? Is this who you are fundamentally, and it will always be this way, or is this a problem to be fixed? For example, one of the things, especially recently, but in general over time I've discovered about myself probably has roots in childhood, probably has roots in a lot of things, is I deeply value loyalty maybe more than the average person. And so when there's disloyalty, it can be painful to me. And so this is who I am, and so do I have to relax a bit? Do I have to fix this part or is this who you are? And there's a million, that's one little...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>doesn't disrupt too many other areas of your life. But it depends also on whose disrupting that loyalty, if it's a coworker versus a romantic partner versus your exclusive romantic partner, depending on the structure of your romantic partner life. I mean, I have always experienced extreme joy and feelings of safety and trust in my friendships. Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships too, which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships. The female friendships have also been very loyal. So getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with. And yeah, I love being crewed up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. No, for sure. And I'm with you and you and I very much have the same values on this, but that's one little thing. And then there's many other things like I'm extremely self-critical and I look at myself as I'm regularly very self-critical, a self-critical engine in my brain. And I talked to actually Paul about this, I think on the podcast quite a bit. And he's saying, \"This is a really bad thing. You need to fix this. You need to be able to be regularly very positive about yourself.\" And I kept disagreeing with him, \"No, this is who I am,\" and he seems to work. Don't mess with a thing that seems to be working. It's fine. I oscillate between being really grateful and really self-critical. But then you have to figure out what is it? Maybe there's a deeper root thing. Maybe there's an insecurity in there somewhere that has to do with childhood and then you're trying to prove something to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sleep well at night, you can be stressed all day, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. And it'll optimize your focus. But can you fall asleep and stay deeply asleep at night? Being in a hard relationship. Some people say that's not good. Other people like can you be at peace in that? And I think we all have different RPM. We all kind of idle at different RPM and some people are big mellow Costello and others need more friction in order to feel at peace. But I think ultimately what we want is to feel at peace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've been through some really low points over the past couple of years, and I think the reason could be boiled down to the fact that I haven't been able to find a place of peace, a place or people or moments that give deep inner peace. And I think you put it really beautifully. You have to figure out, given who you are, the various characteristics of your mind, all the things, all the contents of the cupboards, how to get space from it. And ultimately one good representation of that is to be able to laugh at all of it, whatever's going on inside your mind to be able to step back and just kind of chuckle at the beauty and the absurdity of the whole thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and keep going. There's this beautiful, as I mentioned, it seems like every podcast lately. I'm a huge Rancid fan.

He doesn't advertise that much because he's humble but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, I went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago.<|eot_id|>"}

Where I'll take the train up from New York. I'm going to meet a friend of mine named Jim Thiebaud, who's a guy who owns a lot of companies, the skateboard industry. We're meeting there, a couple of little kids to go see them play amazing, amazing people, amazing music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Very intense.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>skilled. And sometimes that involves the tools I just mentioned in various combinations and you figure it out. You figure out if it's serving you. Obviously it was not bringing me peace. My sense of justice was undermining my sense of peace. And so in understanding this link... Now, I would say, in understanding this link between justice and anger, now I think it's a little bit more of you know, it's not like a Twizzler stick bendy, but at least it's not like an iron rod. When I see somebody wronged, I mean it used to just... Like immediately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you're able to step back now. To me, the ultimate place to reach is laughter.<|eot_id|>"}

I mean, recently I got to see how sometimes I'll see something that's just like, \"What? This is crazy,\" so I just laugh. But then, I continue to engage in it and it's taking me off course. And so, there is a place where... I mean, I realize this is probably a kid show too so I want to keep it G-rated. But at some point, for certain things, it makes sense to go, \"Fuck that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also, laugh at yourself for saying, \"Fuck that.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And then, move on.

And I mean, the way he talks about it, he's a huge fan of history. He talks about all the warriors that have fought throughout history. Look, he wants to really do it at the Coliseum. And the Coliseum is for 400 years, there's so much great writing about this, I think over 400,000 people have died in the Coliseum, gladiators. So this is this historic place that sheds so much blood, so much fear, so much anticipation of battle, all of this. So he loves this kind of spectacle and also, the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it.

Sort of an only in America kind of tale too, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So speaking of Shakespeare, I've recently gotten to know Neri Oxman who's this incredible scientist that works at the intersection of nature and engineering and she reminded me of this Anna Akhmatova line. This is this great Soviet poet that I really love from over a century ago that each of our lives is a Shakespearean drama raised to the thousand degree. So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted to this kind of Shakespearean drama? Is there some aspect we've been talking about the subconscious mind that pulls us towards the drama, even though the place of mental health is peace?<|eot_id|>"}

And sometimes, not making it means the career they wanted went off a cliff or their health went off a cliff or their life went off a cliff. But I think that there's also the Shakespearean drama of the characters that exit the play and are living their lives happily in the backdrop. It just doesn't make for as much entertainment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's one other thing, you could say, is the benefit of getting older is finding the Shakespearean drama less appealing or finding the joy in the peace.<|eot_id|>"}

I do all the things that I talk about.

It just takes me... It's an inventory of where I've been, where I'm at, and where I'm going as they say. And I don't know why I do it but I started doing it this last year, I think, because it helps me understand just how many different contexts I have to exist in and remind myself that there's still more that I haven't done that I'm excited about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So within each of those contexts, there's things that you want to accomplish to define that.<|eot_id|>"}

I think that's all I can talk about it. Mostly because I'm still working out. The scientists in me wants to understand how it works and I want to understand. And the point is to just go, for lack of a better language for it, \"There's a higher power than me and what I can control. I'm giving up control on certain things.\" And somehow, that restores a sense of agency for right action and better action.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think perhaps a part of that is just the humility that comes with acknowledging there's something bigger and more powerful than you.<|eot_id|>"}

She's happily married with a child and we're on good terms. But I think it's a scary thing but it's the best thing when you just, \"I can't control all of this.\" And asking for help, I think is also the piece. You're not asking for some magic hand to come down and take care of it but you're asking for the help to come through you so that your body is used to do these right works, right action.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Isn't it interesting that this secret thing that you're almost embarrassed by, that you did as a child is something you...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this stuff really works. B, it's grounded in something real. Sometimes, certain protocols are a combination of animal and human studies, sometimes clinical trials. Sometimes there's some mechanistic conjecture for some, not all, I always make clear which. But in the end, figuring out how things work so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less, reduce the suffering of the world. And I think that... Well, I'll just say thank you for asking about the prayer piece. Again, I'm not pushing or even encouraging it on anyone. I've just found it to be tremendously useful for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, about prayer in general. You said information and figuring out how to get stronger, healthier, smarter, all those kinds of things. A part of me believes that deeply.

They're just afraid... Sometimes, the strength is even a way to try and not be weak which is different than being strong for its own sake. I'm not just talking about physical strength. I'm talking about intellectual strength. I'm talking about money. I'm talking about expressing drive.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>won't. This is advanced contracting of behavior for a species that normally we don't think of as sophisticated as us. So it's very interesting and it gets to something that I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately, is this notion of overt versus covert contracts, right? There are overt contracts where you exchange work for money or you exchange any number of things in an overt way. But then, there are covert contracts, and those take on a very different form and always lead to, in my belief, bad things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, how much of human and chimp relationships are overt versus covert?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>takes a lot of brain work. You're playing chess and go simultaneously trying to figure out where things are going to end up and we just don't know. So it's a way, I think, of creating a false sense of certainty. But I'll tell you, covert contracts, the only certainty is that it's going to end badly. The question is, how badly? Conversely, overt contracts always end well, always. The problem with overt contracts is that you can't be certain that the other person is not engaging in a covert contract. You can only take responsibility for your own contracting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, one of the challenges of being human is looking at another human being and figuring out their way of being, their behavior, which of the two types of contracts it represents because they look awfully the same on the surface. And one of the challenges of being human, the decision we all make is, are you somebody that takes a leap of trust and trust other humans and are willing to take the hurt or are you going to be cynical and skeptical and avoid most interactions until they, over a long period of time, prove your trust?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I never liked the phrase history repeats itself when it comes to humans because it doesn't apply if the people or the person is actively working to resolve their own flaws. I do think that if people are willing to do dedicated, introspective work, go into their subconscious, do the hard work, have hard conversations, and get better at hard conversations, something that I'm- Have hard conversations and get better at hard conversations, something that I'm constantly trying to get better at. I think people can change, but they have to want to change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It does seem like, deep down, we all can tell the difference between overt and covert. We have a good sense. I think one of the benefits of having this characteristic of mine, where I value loyalty, I've been extremely fortunate to spend most of my life in overt relationships and I think that creates a really fulfilling life.<|eot_id|>"}

And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot. Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and safely and correctly, keeping good form saying, \"No,\" when I need to say no, but training a lot, and taking it seriously.

I think, based on my experience, and based on input from friends, who themselves have very successful relationships, I must say, I've got friends who are in long-term, monogamous, very happy relationships, where there seems to be a lot of love, a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge and a lot of growth.

Earlier we were talking about peace, and I think that that sense of peace comes from knowing that the person you're in friendship with, or that you're in romantic relationship, or ideally both, because let's assume the best romantic relationship includes a friendship component with that person. It's like you just really delight in their presence, even if it's a quiet presence.

And I think it's because it gets right into the more hardwired, primitive circuitry around our feelings of safety, vulnerability.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on, I think.

I don't know. That's not for me to say or decide obviously, but there's something there, about staying out of a certain amount of risk of having to engage covert contract in order to protect oneself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I do think love at first sight, this kind of idea is, in part, realizing very quickly that you are great friends.

That's, from the papers I've read, is a significant but still mildly significant result. So with each passing year, this person increases the probability they're going to have a daughter, not a son.

So there's something there, I believe, because with people that have the strong generative drive and want to be productive in their home life, in the sense have a rich family life, partner life, whatever that is, and in their work life, the ability to really drop into the work and you might have that sense like, \"I hope they're okay,\" or, \"need to check my phone or something,\" but just know we're good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Everything's okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So peace and focus, I think and being present are so key. And it's key at every level of romantic relationship, from certainly presence and focus. Everything from sex to listening to raising a family, to tending to the house and in work, it's absolutely critical. So I think that those things are mirror images of the same thing. And they're both important reflections of the other. And when work is not going well, then the focus on relationship can suffer and vice versa.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's crazy how important that is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Peace.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How incredibly wonderful it could be to have a person in your life that enables that creative focus.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Conti episode on relationships is that the superficial labels are less important, it seems, than just the desire to create that kind of home life and relationship together. And as a consequence, the work mode. And for some people, both people aren't working and sometimes they are. But I think that's the good stuff. And I think that's the big learning in all of it, is that the further along I go, with each birthday, I guarantee you're going to be like, \"What I want is simpler and simpler and harder and harder to create. But oh, so worth it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The inner and the outer peace. It's been over two years, I think, since Costello passed away.<|eot_id|>"}

It was almost like he was like all that effort, because I had been putting so much effort into him, it was like, \"All right, you get that back.\" It was like the giant freaking, \"Thank you.\" And it was incredible. And I'm not embarrassed to shed a tear or two about it if I have to. I was like, \"Holy shit.\" That's how close I was to that animal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where do you think can find that kind of love again?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I could without detracting from the rest of my life. And so I don't know. When I think about Barbara especially, I well up and it's hard for me, but I talked to her before she died and that was a brutal conversation, saying goodbye to someone, especially with kids. And that was hard. I think that really flipped a switch in me where I'm like, I always knew I wanted kids. I'd say, \"I want kids. I want a lot of kids.\" That flipped a switch in me. I was like, \"I want kids. I want my own kids.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You might be able to find that kind of love having kids.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think because it was the caretaking. It wasn't about what he gave me all that time, and the more I could take care of him and see him happy, the better I felt. It was crazy. I don't know. So I miss him every day. Every day. I miss him every day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got a heart that's so full of love. I can't wait for you to have kids.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the people in our life. Because in case you haven't realized it already, we're the younger of the podcasters. But like Joe and Peter and Segura and the rest, they're like the tribal elders and we're not the youngest in the crew. But if you look at all those guys, they all have kids. They all adore their kids and their kids bring tremendous meaning to their life. We'd be morons if you didn't go off and start a family, I didn't start start a family. And yeah, I think that's the goal. Of the goals, that's one of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The kids not only make their life more joyful and brings love to their life, it's also makes them more productive, makes them better people, all of that.

For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there's something stronger - something better, pushing right back.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
