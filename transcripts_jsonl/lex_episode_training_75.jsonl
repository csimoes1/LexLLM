{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people who are evil are not like us. They're class apart. Everybody in history who has sinned is a person who's very different from me. Robert George, the philosopher over at Princeton, he's fond of doing a thought experiment in his classes where he asks people to raise their hand If they had lived in Alabama in 1861, how many of you would be abolitionists? And everybody raises their hand and he says, \"Of course that's not true.\" The best protection against evil is recognizing that it lies in every human heart and the possibility that it takes you over.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you ever sit back in the quiet of your mind and think, Am I participating in evil? The following is a conversation with Ben Shapiro, a conservative political commentator, host of the Ben Shapiro show, co-founder of The Daily Wire, and author of several books, including The Authoritarian Moment, The Right Side of History and Facts Don't Care About Your Feelings. Whatever Your political leanings, I humbly asked that you tried to put those aside and listen with an open mind trying to give the most charitable interpretation of the words we say. This is true in general for this podcast, whether the guest is Ben Shapiro or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Donald Trump, or Barack Obama, I will talk to everyone from every side, from the far left to the far right, from presidents to prisoners, from artists to scientists, from the powerful to the powerless, because we are all human, all capable of good and evil, all with fascinating stories and ideas to explore. I seek only to understand, and in so doing, hopefully add a bit of love to the world. This is Lex Fridman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro. Let's start with a difficult topic. What do you think about the comments made by Ye formerly known as Kanye West about Jewish people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're awful and antisemitic and they seem to get worse over time. They started off with the bizarre death con 3 tweet, and then they went into even more stereotypical garbage about Jews and Jews being sexual manipulators. I think that was the Pete Davidson, Kim Kardashian stuff, and then Jews running all of the media, Jews being in charge of the financial sector. Jewish people... I called it on my show, there's Sherman Nazism, and it is. It's like right from protocols of the Elders of Zion type stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think those words come from pain, where they come from?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>drive you well past the point where common sense applies. So I would imagine it's coming from that. From his comments, I would also imagine that he's doing the logical mistake that a lot of anti-Semites or racist or bigots do, which is somebody hurt me, that person is a Jew, therefore all Jews are bad. And that jump from a person did something to me I don't like, who's a member of a particular race or class, and therefore everybody of that race or class is bad. That's textbook bigotry and that's pretty obviously what Ye's, engaging in here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So jumping from the individual to the group.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the way he's been expressing it, right? He keeps talking about his Jewish agents, and I watched your interview with him and you kept saying this, \"So just name the agents. Just name the people who are screwing you.\" And he wouldn't do it. Instead, he just kept going back to the general, the group, the Jews in general. That's textbook bigotry, and if we're putting any other context, he would probably recognize it as such.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To the degree that's what fuels hate in the world. What's the way to reverse that process? What's the way to alleviate the hate?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and he's saying so very loudly and he's saying it over and over. But for example, there were these signs that were popping up in Los Angeles saying, Ye is right. That group's been out there posting antisemitic signs on the freeways for years, and their groups like that posting antisemitic signs where I live in Florida, they've been doing that for years, well before Ye was saying this sort of stuff. It's just like the latest opportunity to jump on that particular bandwagon. But listen, I think that people do have a moral duty to call that stuff out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there is a degree to which it normalizes that idea that Jews control the media, Jews control X institution. Is there a way to talk about a high representation of a group like Jewish people in a certain institution like the media or Hollywood and so on without it being a hateful conversation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>necessarily mean anything about the nature of the people who are being talked about. They're a myriad of reasons why people might be disproportionately in one arena or another. Ranging from the cultural to sometimes the genetic. There are certain areas of the world where people are better long distance runners because of their genetic adaptations in those particular areas of the world. That's not racist, that's just fact. What starts to get racist is when you are attributing a bad characteristic to an entire population based on the notion that some members of that population are doing bad things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a jump between... It's also possible that record label owners as a group have a culture that Fs over artists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Doesn't treat artists fairly. And it's also possible that there's a high representation of Jews in the group of people that own record labels, but it's that small, but a very big leap that people take from the group that own record labels to all Jews.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or are predominantly represented in this group. So you'll see Nazis saying the communists are Jews. You'll see communist saying the Nazis are Jews. Or you'll see communist saying that the capitalists rather are Jews. And so that's the weird thing about antisemitism. It's like the Jews behind every corner. It's basically a big conspiracy theory. Unlike a lot of other forms of racism, which are not really conspiracy theory, antisemitism tends to be a conspiracy theory about the levers of power being controlled by a shadowy cadre of people who are getting together behind closed doors to control things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The most absurd illustration of antisemitism, just like you said, is Stalin versus Hitler over Poland that every bad guy was a Jew. So every enemy... There's a lot of different enemy groups, intellectuals, political and so on. Military. And behind any movement that is considered the enemy for the Nazis and any movement that's considered the enemy for the Soviet army are the Jews. What is the fact that Hitler took power teach you about human nature? When you look back at the history of the 20th century, what do you learn from that time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the government before Hitler took it. So if you actually look at the history of Nazi Germany, the Weimar Republic had effectively collapsed. The power had been centralized in the Chancellor and really under Hindenburg for a couple of years before that. And so it was only a matter of time until someone who was bad grabbed the power. And so the struggle between the reds and the browns in Nazism, in pre Nazi Germany led to this up spiraling of radical sentiment that allowed Hitler in through the front door, not through the back door, he was elected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you think Communists could have also taken power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no question Communists could have taken power. There were serious force in pre Nazi Germany.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there was an underlying current that would've led to an atrocity if the communist had taken power?<|eot_id|>"}

And you see this kind of language by the way now, predominating almost all over the western world. My political enemy is an enemy of democracy. My political enemy is going to end the republic. My political enemy is going to be the person who destroys the country we live in. And so that person has to be stopped by any means necessary, and that's dangerous stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the communists had to be stopped in Nazi Germany, and so they're the devil. And so any useful buffoon, as long as they're effective against the communists would do. Do you ever wonder because the people that are participating in evil may not understand that they're doing evil. Do you ever sit back in the quiet of your mind and think, Am I participating in evil?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think you have to constantly be thinking along those lines and hopefully you try to avoid it. You can only do the best that a human being can do. But yeah, the answer is yes. I would say that I spend an inordinate amount of time reflecting on whether I'm doing the right thing and I may not always do the right thing. I'm sure a lot of people think that I'm doing the wrong thing on a daily basis. But it's definitely a question that has to enter your mind as a historically aware and hopefully morally decent person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think you're mentally strong enough if you realize that you are on the wrong side of history to switch sides? Very few people in history seem to be strong enough to do that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be yes. You never know until the time comes and you have to do it. I will say that having heterodox opinions in a wide variety of areas is something that I have done before. I'm the only person I've ever heard of in public life who actually has a list on their website of all the dumb stupid things I've ever said. So where I go through and I either say, \"This is why I still believe this, or this is why what I said was terrible and stupid.\" And I'm sure that list will get a lot longer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I look forward to new additions to that list.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It actually is a super, super long list. People should check it out. And it's quite honest and raw. It's interesting to ask you, given how pro-life you are about, Ye's, comments about comparing the Holocaust to the 900, 000 abortions in the United States a year.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and small children in the gas chambers, can't be compared to a person who even from pro-life perspective, may not fully understand the consequences of their own decisions or from a pro-choice perspective, fully understands the consequences, but just doesn't think that that person is a person. That, that's actually different. So I understand both sides of it. I wasn't offended by Ye's comments in that way though, because if you're a pro-life human being, then you do think that what's happening is a great tragedy on scale that involves the dehumanization of an entire class of people, the pre-born.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the philosophical you understand the comparison.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in his comments, in the jumping from the individual to the group, I'd like to ask you... You're one of the most effective people in the world that are attacking the left, and sometimes it can slip into attacking the group. Do you worry that's the same kind of oversimplification that Ye's, doing about Jewish people that you can sometimes do with the left as a group?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a person in front of me and said, \"Is this person of the left or of the right?\" Having just met them, I wouldn't be able to label them in the same way that if you met somebody in the name of Greenstein, you'd immediately go Jew, or you make a black person, they're a black person. And that the adherence to a philosophy makes you a member of a group. If I think the philosophy is bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that you as a person are bad. But it does mean that I think your philosophy is bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the grouping is based on the philosophy versus something like a race. The color of your skin or race as in the case of the Jewish people. So it's a different thing. You can be a little bit more nonchalant and careless in attacking a group because it's ultimately attacking a set of ideas.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is really nonchalant in attacking the set of ideas. And I don't know that nonchalant would be the way I'd put it. I try to be exact, you don't always hit. But if I say that I oppose the Communists and then presumably I'm speaking of people who believe in the Communists philosophy. Now the question is whether I'm mislabeling, whether I'm taking somebody who's not actually a communist and then shoving them in that group of Communists, that would be inaccurate.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The dangerous thing is it expands the group as opposed to you talking about the philosophy you're throwing everybody who's ever said, \"I'm curious about communism. I'm curious about socialism.\" There's like a gradient. It's like to throw something at you, I think Joe Biden said, \"Maga Republicans.\" I think that's a very careless statement because the thing you jump to immediately is all Republicans.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>All Republicans voted for Trump.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Vote for Trump versus I think in the charitable interpretation that means a set of ideas.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we can have. And then we'll have to discuss how much power they have, what the actual perspective is, delve into it. But I think that he was being over broad and labeling all of his political enemies under one rubric. Now again, in politics, this stuff happens all the time. I'm not going to plead clean hands here because I'm sure that I've been in exact. But somebody who would be good in that particular situation is for somebody to read me back the quote and I'll let you know where I've been inaccurate. I'll try to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also you don't shy away from humor and occasional trolling and mockery and all that kind of stuff for the fun, for chaos, all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>seriously, but also I have the ability to of flip the switch and suddenly it all becomes incredibly funny because it really is like if you just watch it from a pure entertainment perspective and you put aside the fact that it affects hundreds of millions of people. Then watching President Trump being president, he's one of the funniest humans who's ever lived watching Kamala Harris be Kamala Harris and talking about how much he loves Venn diagrams or electric buses. That's funny stuff. So if I can't make fun of that, then my job becomes pretty morose pretty quickly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's funny to figure out what is the perfect balance between seeing the humor and the absurdity of the game of it versus taking it seriously enough because it does affect hundreds of millions of people. It's a weird balance to strike. It's like I am afraid with the internet that everything becomes a joke.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>say this, I try to make less jokes about the ideas and more jokes about the people in the same way that I make jokes about myself. I'm pretty self-effacing in terms of my humor. I would say at least half the jokes on my show are about me when I'm reading ads for Tommy John and they're talking about their no wedgie guarantee, I'll say things like that would've helped me in high school because it would've, just factually speaking. So if I can speak that way about myself, I feel like everybody else can take it as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Difficult question. In 2017, there was a mosque shooting in Quebec City, six people died, five others seriously injured. The 27 year old gunman consumed a lot of content online and checked Twitter accounts a lot, of a lot of people. But one of the people he checked quite a lot of is you 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting. If you could talk to that young man, what would you tell him? And maybe other young men listening to this that have hate in their heart in that same way. What would you tell them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I just think that if we remove agency from individuals, and if we blame broad scale political rhetoric for every act of violence the people who are going to pay the price are actually the general population because free speech will go away. If the idea is that things that we say could drive somebody who is unbalanced to go do something evil, the necessary byproduct is hate, is that speech is a form of hate. Hate is a form of violence, speech is a form of violence. Speech needs to be curbed. And that to me is deeply disturbing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So definitely that man, that 27 year old man is the only one responsible for the evil he did. But what if he and others like him are not nut cases? What if they're people with pain, with anger in their heart? What would you say to them? You're exceptionally influential and other people like you that speak passionately about ideas. What do you think is your opportunity to alleviate the hate in their heart?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And this is why the message that I most commonly say to young men is, It's time for you to grow up, mature, get a job, get married, have a family, take care of the people around you, become a useful part of your community. Never at any point in my entire career suggested violence as a resort to political issues. The whole point of having a political conversation is that it's a conversation. If I didn't think that it were worth trying to convince people of my point of view, I wouldn't do what I do for a living.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So violence doesn't solve anything?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, it doesn't.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As if this wasn't already a difficult conversation. Let me ask about Ilhan Omar, you've called out her criticism of Israel policies as antisemitic. Is there a difference between criticizing a race of people like the Jews and criticizing the policies of a nation like Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the form of suggesting, for example, that Israel is an apartheid state, which it is most eminently not considering that the last unity government in Israel included an Arab party, that there are Arabs who sit on the Israeli Supreme Court and all the rest. And then beyond that, obviously she's engaged in some of the same antisemitic ropes that you heard from Ye. The stuff about, it's all about the Benjamins, that American support for Israel is all about the Benjamins, and she's had to be [inaudible 00:29:36] by members of her own party about this stuff before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you empathize with the plight of Palestinian people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>leaves them in misery or Islamic Jihad, which is an actual terrorist group. The basic rule for the region, in my view, is if these groups were willing to make peace of Israel, they would have a state literally tomorrow. And if they are not, then there will be no peace. And it really is that simple. The formulas typically used, it's become a bit of a bumper sticker, but it happens to be factually correct. If the Palestinians put down their guns tomorrow, there would be a state. If the Israelis put down their guns, there'd be no Israel,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You get attacked a lot on the internet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, you noticed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got to ask you about your own psychology. How do you not let that break you mentally? And how do you avoid letting that lead to a resentment of the groups that attack you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So there are a few-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... that meant of the groups that attack you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>right? The notifications button is just people talking about you all the time and the normal human tendency as, Wow, people talking about me, I got to see what they're saying about me. Which is a recipe for insanity. So my wife actually said, \"Twitter is making your life miserable. You need to take it off your phone.\" So Twitter is not on my phone. If I want to log onto Twitter, I have to go onto my computer and I have to make the conscious decision to go onto Twitter and then take a look at what's going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I could just imagine you, there's a computer in the basement; you dissent in to check Twitter in the darkness-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's pretty much, I mean, if you look at when I actually tweet, it's generally in the run-up to recording my show, or when I'm prepping for my show later in the afternoon, for example.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That doesn't affect you negatively, mentally, like put you in a bad mental space.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or wealthy or anything. So she's a good sounding board. I have a family that's willing to call me out on my bullshit as you talk to Ye about. I have friends who are able to do that. I try to have open lines of communications with people who I believe have my best interests at heart. But one of the sort of conditions of being friends is that when you see me do something wrong, I'd like for you to let me know that so I can correct it, and I don't want to leave that impressions out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The sad thing about the internet, just looking at the critiques you get, I see very few critiques from people that actually want you to succeed, want you to grow.

Then the internet explodes and all of a sudden you can get news everywhere, and the way that people are accessing that news is... You're, I believe, significantly younger than I am. But we used to do this thing called bookmarking, where you would bookmark a series of websites and then you would visit them every morning, and then social media came up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is this on AOL or-<|eot_id|>"}

He said something wrong, people ripped into him, he realized he was wrong, and he's deleted it, which seems to be a better solution than preemptively banning content, which only raises more questions than it actually stops. With that said, as the face of responsible free speech, and that's sort of what he's pitching at Twitter, he I think should enact that himself and be a little more careful in the stuff that he tweets out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's a tricky balance. The reason a lot of people are freaking out is because one, he's putting his thumb on the scale by saying he is more likely to vote Republican. He's showing himself to be center-right, and just having a political opinion versus being this amorphous thing that doesn't have a political opinion. I think, I haven't talked to him about it, but if I were to guess, he's sending a kind of signal that's important for Twitter, the company itself, because if we're being honest, most of the employees are left-leaning. So you have to send a signal like a resisting mechanism to say, since most of the employees are left, it's good for Elon to be more right to balance out the way the actual engineering is done to say, \"We're not going to do any kind of act activism inside the engineering.\" If I were to guess, that's the effective aspect of that mechanism. The other one by posting the Pelosi thing is probably to expand the Overton window. Like saying, \"We could post stuff, we could post conspiracy theories and then through discourse figure out what is and isn't true.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fine. I run a conservative site. We're not going to put up left wing opinions on a wide variety of issues because we are conservative site. But if you pitch yourself as a platform, that's a different thing. If you pitch yourself as the town square, as Elon likes to call it, then I think Elon has a better idea of that than many of the former employees did. Especially now that we have that report from the Intercept suggesting that there are people from Twitter working with DHS to monitor \"disinformation\" and being rather vague about what disinformation meant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I don't think activism has a place in what is fundamentally an engineering company that's building a platform. The people inside the company should not be putting a thumb on the scale of what is and isn't allowed. You should create a mechanism for the people to decide what is and isn't allowed.

Unless you violated a criminal statute, you should not be unpersoned in American society as a general rule.

He was getting a pretty standard consulting kind of money, which also would criticize because they get a ridiculous amount of money. But sort of even to push back on the life cycle or [inaudible 00:56:52] madness, the side that was concerned about the Hunter Biden laptop story. I don't know if there is a natural life cycle of a story because there's something about the virality of the internet that we can't predict that a story can just take hold and the conspiracy around it builds, especially around politics, where some popular sexy interpretation of a story that might not be connected to reality at all will become viral. That from Facebook's perspective is probably what they're worried about is organized misinformation campaign that makes up a sexy story or sexy interpretation of the vague story that we have, and that has an influence on the populace.<|eot_id|>"}

We're going to all colludes that this information is not distributed.\" Maybe in response to the story being proof false, it gets taken down. But, well, what made the Hunter Biden thing so amazing is that it wasn't relieving in response to anything. It was like the story got posted. There were no actual doubts expressed as to the verified falsity of the story. It was just supposition that it had to be false and everybody jumped in. So I think that confirmed a lot of the conspiracy theories people had about social media and how it works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if the reason you want to slow down the viral spread of a thing is at all grounded in partisanship, that's a problem. You should be very honest with yourself and ask yourself that question, \" Is it because I'm on the left or on the right that I want to slow this down?\" Versus, is it hate, bipartisan hate speech? But it's really tricky. But like you, I'm very uncomfortable in general, but then you kind of slowing down with any kind of censorship. But if there's something like a conspiracy theory that spreads hate, that becomes viral. I still lean to let that conspiracy theory spread because the alternative is dangerous, more dangerous.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Her original response was that she proffered confusion of what Ye was actually talking about and then she was defending her friend.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Privately is also a big thing. I mean like the public demand for denunciation from friends to friends is difficult.

On a federal level, I think the federal government can't really do much other than close the borders with regard to fentanyl trafficking, for example.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Ukrainians have been successful in pushing the Russians out of certain parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, but the idea they're going to be able to push the entire Russian army completely back to the Russian borders, that would be at best a very, very long and difficult slog in the middle of a collapsing Ukrainian economy, which is a point that Zelensky has made. It's like it's not enough for you guys to give us military aid. We're in the middle of a war, we're going to need economic aid as well. So it's a pretty open-ended and strong commitment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I take a small tangent on that and best case scenario, if that does militarily happen, including Crimea, do you think there's a world in which Vladimir Putin would be able to convince the Russian people that this was a good conclusion to the war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>checks, right?

It's for them to just say, \"Well this is up to the Ukrainians to decide. It's up to the Ukrainians to decide.\" Well is it totally up to the Ukrainians to decide, because it seems like the West is signing an awful lot of checks and all of Europe is going to freeze this winter?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is the importance of great leadership by the way. That's why the people we elect is very important. Do you think there's power to just one on one conversation, or Biden sits down with Zelensky, and Biden sits down with Putin, almost in person?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>private meeting, maybe that's the best thing. If it's a public facing forum, I think it's a problem because Putin's afraid of being humiliated at this point. If it's a private meeting, then sure, except that again, I wonder whether when it comes to a person as canny as Putin and to a politician that I really don't think is a particularly sophisticated player in Joe Biden. And again this is not unique to Biden, I think that most of our presidents for the last 30, 40 years have not been particularly sophisticated players. I think that's a risky scenario.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I still believe in the power of that because otherwise, I don't know. I don't think stuff on paper and political speak will solve these kinds of problems because from the Zelensky perspective, nothing but complete victory will do. As a nation, has people sacrificed way too much and they're all in. If you look at, because I traveled to Ukraine, I spent time there. I'll be going back there hopefully also going back to Russia, just speaking to Ukrainians, they're all in. They're all in.<|eot_id|>"}

Actually, not even America, honestly, just the president be able to eat their own ego a bit and be the punching bag a little.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we are driven now toward fighting institutions because institutions are in positions.

It's a, I think, much deeper model of how to think about why our social politics particular, are moving in a particular direction is that a ground shift has happened in how people think about themselves.

They believe that up until 12 or 15 weeks, there's not enough there to not be specific, but to be how people feel about it to outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy. then beyond that point, then there's enough of an interest in the life of the pre-born child that's developed enough then now we care about it enough that it outweighs a woman's bodily autonomy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the strongest case for pro-life in your mind?<|eot_id|>"}

If I left a newborn baby on a table and did not take care of it would be dead in two days. So once you start getting into these lines, it starts to get very fuzzy very quickly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't believe that consciousness is the sole criterion by which we judge the self-interest in human life.

If you're not, I know that you have other priorities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the fascinating thing about the climate change debate is the dynamics of the fearmongering over the past few decades, because some of the nuclear energy was tied up into that somehow. There's a lot of fear about nuclear energy. It seems like there's a lot of social phenomena, social dynamics involved versus dealing with just science. It's interesting to watch.

And we'll also have had the joy of experiencing the flow they talk about in psychology where when you engage in these roles, you actually do feel a flow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So these roles are a fundamental part of the human condition?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a crisis of faith and an ongoing question of faith, which I think is, I hope most religious people...

I mean, there's a fairly well known capitalistic concept called [foreign language 02:08:08] in Judaism, which is the idea that when God created the universe, he sort of withdrew in order to make space for all of these things to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So God doesn't have an instrumental perspective on liberty?<|eot_id|>"}

You'll notice that in that statement, it's thy neighbor, it's not just generally anyone. It's love thy neighbors. In any case, the-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think that extends to anyone that follows you on Twitter, thy neighbor. Because God anticipated the social network aspect.

And so if you love everybody, then that sort of implies a certain level of solidarity that may not exist. So maybe the idea is, for me, start with respect and then maybe as people respect each other more, then love is an outgrowth of that. As opposed to starting with love, and then hoping that respect develops.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a danger that word becomes empty, and instead is used for dogmatic kind of utopianism versus-<|eot_id|>"}
