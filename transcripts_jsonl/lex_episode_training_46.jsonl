{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't think we kill people in other countries to affect election outcomes. Oh wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Tucker Carlson, a highly influential and often controversial political commentator. When he was a Fox, Time Magazine called him the most powerful conservative in America. After Fox. He has continued to host big, impactful interviews and shows on X, on the Tucker Carlson podcast, and on tuckercarlson.com. I recommend subscribing, even if you disagree with his views. It is always good to explore a diversity of perspectives. Most recently, he interviewed the President of Russia of Vladimir Putin. We discussed this, the topic of Russia, Putin, Navalny, and the War in Ukraine at length in this conversation. Please allow me to say a few words about the very fact that I did this interview. I have received a lot of criticism publicly and privately when I announced that I'll be talking with Tucker. For people who think I shouldn't do the conversation with Tucker or generally think that there are certain people I should never talk to, I'm sorry, but I disagree. I will talk to everyone, as long as they're willing to talk genuinely in long form for 2, 3, 4 or more hours. I'll talk to Putin and to Zelensky, to Trump and to Biden, to Tucker and to John Stewart, AOC, Obama, and many more people with very different views on the world. I want to understand people and ideas. That's what long form conversations are supposed to be all about. Now for people who criticize me for not asking tough questions, I hear you, but again, I disagree. I do often ask tough questions. But I try to do it in a way that doesn't shut down the other person, putting them into a defensive state where they give only shallow talking points. Instead, I'm looking always for the expression of genuinely held ideas and the deep roots of those ideas. When done well, this gives us a chance to really hear out the guest and to begin to understand what and how they think. And I trust the intelligence of you, the listener, to make up your own mind to see through the bullshit, to the degree there's bullshit and to see to the heart of the person. Sometimes I fail at this, but I'll continue working my ass off to improve. All that said, I find that this no tough questions criticism often happens when the guest is a person the listener simply hates and wants to see them grilled into embarrassment. Called the liar, a greedy egomaniac, a killer, maybe even an evil human being and so on. If you are such a listener, what you want is drama, not wisdom. In this case, this show is not for you. There are many shows you can go to for that with hosts that are way more charismatic and entertaining than I'll ever be. If you do stick around, please know I will work hard to do this well and to keep improving. Thank you for your patience and thank you for your support. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast To support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Tucker Carlson.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it or not, or whether you think it's relevant to the war in Ukraine or not, that was his answer.

You know what I mean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He was doing the thing that he loves doing and it somehow keeps accidentally being exceptionally successful.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know everything. That's so boorish and also false. You don't know everything. But I see that in Rogan. Rogan's like, \"How does that work?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>100%.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The thing I admire about him most, honestly, is that he's a good father. He's a good husband. He's a good family man for many years. That's his place where he escapes from the world too and it's just beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It sounds dirty, but I'm talking about myself, I was the hottest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 02:45:29]. Yeah. You were just looking in the mirror.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Very nice. So what's the secret to successful relationship, successful marriage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't even know. I mean, no, I'm serious. I got married in August '91, so that's our 30 year of being married.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The collapse of the Soviet Union.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not even humility. Humility is the result of a reality-based worldview, okay?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure, right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>idea that the only things that are real are the things that we can see or measure in a lab. That's insane. That's just dumb.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the religious context, you have this two categories that I really like of the two kinds of people, people who believe they're God and people who know they're not, which is a really interesting division that speaks to humility and a kind of realist worldview of where we are in the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can atheists be in the latter category?<|eot_id|>"}

When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it, always.
