You're saying the US government has control over my questions and they'll arrest me if I ask the wrong question. How are we better than Putin if that's true?\" Killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference in the middle of a debate over $60 billion in Ukraine funding. Maybe the Russians are dumb. I didn't get that vibe at all. I don't think we kill people in other countries to affect election outcomes. Oh wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Tucker Carlson, a highly influential and often controversial political commentator. When he was a Fox, Time Magazine called him the most powerful conservative in America. After Fox. He has continued to host big, impactful interviews and shows on X, on the Tucker Carlson podcast, and on tuckercarlson.com. I recommend subscribing, even if you disagree with his views. It is always good to explore a diversity of perspectives. Most recently, he interviewed the President of Russia of Vladimir Putin. We discussed this, the topic of Russia, Putin, Navalny, and the War in Ukraine at length in this conversation. Please allow me to say a few words about the very fact that I did this interview. I have received a lot of criticism publicly and privately when I announced that I'll be talking with Tucker. For people who think I shouldn't do the conversation with Tucker or generally think that there are certain people I should never talk to, I'm sorry, but I disagree. I will talk to everyone, as long as they're willing to talk genuinely in long form for 2, 3, 4 or more hours. I'll talk to Putin and to Zelensky, to Trump and to Biden, to Tucker and to John Stewart, AOC, Obama, and many more people with very different views on the world. I want to understand people and ideas. That's what long form conversations are supposed to be all about. Now for people who criticize me for not asking tough questions, I hear you, but again, I disagree. I do often ask tough questions. But I try to do it in a way that doesn't shut down the other person, putting them into a defensive state where they give only shallow talking points. Instead, I'm looking always for the expression of genuinely held ideas and the deep roots of those ideas. When done well, this gives us a chance to really hear out the guest and to begin to understand what and how they think. And I trust the intelligence of you, the listener, to make up your own mind to see through the bullshit, to the degree there's bullshit and to see to the heart of the person. Sometimes I fail at this, but I'll continue working my ass off to improve. All that said, I find that this no tough questions criticism often happens when the guest is a person the listener simply hates and wants to see them grilled into embarrassment. Called the liar, a greedy egomaniac, a killer, maybe even an evil human being and so on. If you are such a listener, what you want is drama, not wisdom. In this case, this show is not for you. There are many shows you can go to for that with hosts that are way more charismatic and entertaining than I'll ever be. If you do stick around, please know I will work hard to do this well and to keep improving. Thank you for your patience and thank you for your support. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast To support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Tucker Carlson. What was your first impression when you met Vladimir Putin for the interview?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it a little bit, who had a plan, and I don't think that's the right way to go into any interview. My strong sense, having done a lot of them for a long time, is that it's better to know what you think, to say as much as you can honestly, so you don't get confused by your own lies, and just to be yourself. And I thought that he went into it like an over-prepared student, and I kept thinking, \"Why is he nervous?\" But I guess because he thought a lot of people were going to see it,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But he was also probably prepared to give you a full lesson in history as he did.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a right to know more about the guy, and so just let him talk. Because I don't feel like my reputation's on the line. People have already drawn conclusions about me, I suppose to the extent they have. I'm not interested really in those conclusions anyway, so just let him talk. And so I calmed down and just let him talk. And in retrospect, I thought that was really, really interesting. Whether you agree with it or not, or whether you think it's relevant to the war in Ukraine or not, that was his answer. And so it's inherently significant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you said he was nervous. Were you nervous? Were you afraid? This is Vladimir Putin.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I wasn't afraid at all, and I wasn't nervous at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you drink tea beforehand?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thought I did, it turned out. But yeah, I was just blown away by where we were, and that's kind of one of the main drivers at this stage in my life. That's why I do what I do, is because I'm interested in stuff and I want to see as much as I can and try and draw conclusions from it to the extent I can. So I was very much caught up in that. But no, I wasn't nervous. I didn't think he was going to kill me or something, and I'm not particularly afraid of that anyway.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not afraid of dying?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and stage in life thing. I mean, I have four children, so there were times when they were little where I was terrified of dying because if I died, it would have huge consequences. But no, I mean, at this point, I don't want to die. I'm really enjoying my life. But I've been with the same girl for 40 years, and I have four children who I'm extremely close to. Well, now five, a daughter-in-law, and I love them all. I'm really close to them. I tell them I love them every day. I've had a really interesting life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the goal? Just linger on that. What was the goal for the interview? How were you thinking about it? What would success be like in your head leading into it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To bring more information, to the public.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Disinformation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>News and CNN and all the news channels, all of them tell them that because it's framed exclusively in moral terms, and it's Churchill versus Hitler. And of course, Churchill's going to prevail in the end.\" And it's just so dishonest that it doesn't even matter what I want to happen or what I think ought to happen, that's a distortion of what is happening. And if I have any job at all, which I sort of don't actually at this point, but if I do have a job, it's to just try to be honest, and that's a lie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is a more nuanced discussion about what winning might look like. You're right a nuanced discussion is not being had, but it is possible for Ukraine to, quote unquote, \"win\" with the help of the United States.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I guess that conversation needs to begin by defining terms. And the key term is win. What does that mean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Peace, a ceasefire, who owns which land, coming to the table with, as you call the parent in the United States, putting leverage on the negotiation to make sure there's a fairness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are bigger than he is, to say, \"No, you cannot come to any terms with Russia.\" And the result of that has not been a Ukrainian victory. It's just been more dead Ukrainians and a lot of profit for the West. It's a moral crime in my opinion. And I tried to ask Boris Johnson about it because why wouldn't I? After he denounced me as a tool of the Kremlin or something, and he demanded a million dollars to talk to me. And this just happened last week. And by the way, in writing too, I'm not making this...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just for the record, you demanded a million dollars from me to talk to me today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so I guess these are really... It's not just about Boris Johnson being a sad rapacious fraud, which he is obviously, but it's about the future of the West and the future of Ukraine, this country that purportedly we care so much about. All these people are dying, and what is the end game? It's also deranged that I didn't imagine, and don't imagine that I could add anything very meaningful to the conversation because I'm not a genius. But I felt like I could at the very least, puncture some of the lies, and that's an inherent good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Vladimir Putin, after the interview said that he wasn't fully satisfied because you weren't aggressive enough. You didn't ask sharp enough questions. First of all, what do you think about him saying that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>means for the world. And so I stuck to that. I mean, I did ask about Gershkovich, who I felt sorry for, and I wanted Putin to release him to me. And I was offended that he didn't. I thought his rationale was absurd. \"Well, we want to trade him for someone.\" I said, \"Well, doesn't that make him a hostage?\" Which of course it does. But other than that, I really wanted to keep it to the things that I think matter most. People can judge whether I did a good job or not, but that was my decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the moment, what was your gut? Did you want to ask some tough questions as follow-ups on certain topics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know what it would mean to ask a tough question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Clarifying questions, I suppose they would-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I guess. I just wanted him to talk. I just wanted to hear his perspective again. I've probably asked more asshole questions than any living American. As has been noted correctly, I'm a dick by my nature, and so I just feel at this stage of my life, I didn't need to prove that I could be like, \"Vladimir Putin, answer the question.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For sure. For sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the US economy in a way and at a scale people do not understand. The US dollar is going away. That was, of course, inevitable ultimately because everything dies, including currencies. But that death, that process of death has been accelerated exponentially by the behavior of the Biden administration and the US Congress, particularly the sanctions. And people don't understand what the ramifications of that are. The ramifications are poverty in the United States. So I just wanted to get to that because I'm coming at this from not a global perspective. I'm coming at it from an American perspective.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned Navalny. After you left, Navalny died in prison. What are your thoughts on just at a high level, first about his death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>say killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference in the middle of a debate over $60 billion in Ukraine funding, maybe the Russians are dumb. I didn't get that vibe at all. I don't see it. But maybe they killed him. I mean, they certainly put him in prison, which I'm against. But here's what I do know is that we don't know. And so when Chuck Schumer stands up and [inaudible 00:21:42]. Joe Biden reads some card in front of him with lines about Navalny, it's like, I'm allowed to laugh at that because it's absurd. You don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of interesting ideas about if he was killed, who killed him, because it could be Putin, it could be somebody in Russia who's not Putin. It could be Ukrainians because it would benefit the war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They killed Dugan's daughter in Moscow. So yeah, that's possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it could be... I mean, the United States could also be involved.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>true or substantially true anyway. And that's been a real shock for me in middle age to understand that. But anyway, as to Navalny, look, I don't know. But we should always proceed on the basis of what we do know, which is to say on the basis of truth, knowable truth. And if you have an entire policymaking apparatus that is making the biggest decisions on the face of the planet, on the basis of things that are bullshit or lies, you're going to get bad outcomes every time, every time. And that's why we are where we are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does it bother you that basically the most famous opposition figure in Russia is sitting in prison?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I expected to see a lot of it, like statues of Putin. No. There are no statues of anybody other than Christian saints. I'm not quite sure. I'm just reporting what I saw. So yes, in a political sense. It's not a free country. It's not a democracy in the way that we would understand it or I don't want to live there because I like to say what I think. In fact, I make my living doing it. But it's not Stalinist in a recognizable way. And anyone who says it is should go there and tell me how.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, this question about the freedom of the press is underlying the very fact of the interview you're having with him. So you might not need to ask the Navalny question, but did you feel like, \"Are there things I shouldn't say?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was lecturing on the phone and I had another call with a head lawyer and he said, \"Well, look, a lot will depend on the questions that you ask Putin. If you're seen as too nice to him, you could get arrested when you come back.\" And I was like, \"You're describing a fascist country. Okay. You're saying that the US government will arrest me if I don't ask the questions they want asked, is that what's you're saying?\" \"Well, we just think based on what's happened, that that's possible.\" And so I'm just telling you what happened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you were okay being arrested in Moscow and arrested back in-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I didn't think for a second... I mean, maybe. Look, I don't speak Russian. I'd never been there before. Everything about the culture was brand new to me. Ignorance does protect you sort of when you have no freaking idea what's going on, you're not worried about it. This has happened to me many times. There's a principle there that extends throughout life. So it's completely possible that I was in grave peril and didn't know it because how would I know it? I'm like a bumbling English speaker from California, but I didn't feel it at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the lawyers did.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't want to live in that kind of country. People externalize all of their anxiety about this I have noticed. So it's like Russia is not free. Yeah, I know. Neither is Burkina Faso, most countries aren't free actually, but we are. We're the United States. We're different. That's my concern. Preserving that is my concern. They get so exercised about what's happening in other parts of the world, places they've never been, know nothing about, it's almost a way of ignoring what's happening in their own country right around them. I find it so strange and sad and weird.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the NSA was tracking you? Do you think CIA was? Is people still tracking you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the same thing, which is, \"Are you joking, nothing is secure. Everything is monitored all the time.\" If state actors are involved, you can keep whatever the Malaysian mafia from reading your texts probably. You cannot keep the big Intel services from reading your texts, it's not possible, any of them, or listening to your calls. That was the firm conclusion of people who've been involved in it for a long time, decades, in both cases. I just thought, you know what, I don't care. I don't care. I'm not sending a ton of naked pictures of myself to anybody.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not a ton, just the little?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>does. It was, I don't know, five or six years ago we went to North Korea, and my phone started acting crazy. I talked to someone on the National Security Council, actually who called me about this, somehow knew that your phone is being surveilled by the South Korean government. I was like, \"I like the South Korean government. Why would they do that?\" Because they want more information, they thought I was talking to Trump or whatever. But I could tell because all of a sudden the thing would just drain in like 45 minutes so that's a downside.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You keep switching phones, getting new phones for the battery life. That's good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I try not to do it. I'm kind of flinty Yankee type in some ways, so I don't like to spend $1,000 with the freaking Apple corporation too often, but yeah, I do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You say it lightly, but it's really troublesome that you, as a journalist, would be tracked.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sleeping with the makeup artist or whatever so I don't care that much. The fact that they are leaking against me, that the Intel services in the United States are actively engaged in US politics and media, that's so unacceptable. That makes democracy impossible. There's no defense of that. And yet NBC News, Ken Dilanian and the rest will defend it, and not just on NBC news, by the way, on the supposedly conservative channels too, they will defend it and there's no defending that. You can't have democracy if the Intel services are tempering in elections and information, period.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you had no fear. Your lawyer said, be careful which questions you asked. You said, I don't have-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, no, he said very specifically, depending on the questions you ask Putin, you could be arrested or not. I said, \"Listen to what you're saying. You're saying the US government has control over my questions and they'll arrest me if I ask the wrong question. How are we better than Putin if that's true.\" By the way, that's just what the lawyer said. But I can't overstate, one of the biggest law firms in the United States, smart lawyers we've used for years so I was really shocked by it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said leaders kill, leaders lie.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>my opinion. You shouldn't be seeking power. You can't seek power or wealth for its own sake and remain a decent person. That's just true. So there aren't any really virtuous billionaires and there aren't any really virtuous world leaders. You have grades of virtue, some are better than others for sure. In other words, Zelensky may be better than Putin. I'm open to that possibility. But to claim that one is evil and the other is virtuous, it's like, you're revealing that you're a child, you don't know anything about how the world actually is or what reality is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's quite a realist perspective, but there is a spectrum.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a spectrum, absolutely. I'm not saying they're all the same. They're not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And our task is to figure out where on the spectrum they lie and the leader's task is to confuse us and convince us they're one of the good guys.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>our knowledge. None of that crap. It's a truly beautiful city. That's not an endorsement of Putin. By the way, it didn't make me love Putin, it made me hate my own leaders because I grew up in a country that had cities kind of like that, that were nice cities that were safe, and we don't have that anymore. How did that happen? Did Putin do that? I don't think Putin did that actually. I think the people in charge of that, the mayors, the governors, the president, they did that and they should be held accountable for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think cleanliness and architectural design is not the entirety of the metrics that matter when you measure a city.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and clean and orderly. So that's not a trade off I think I have to make. That is the beauty of being a little bit older because you're like, no, I remember that, actually. It wasn't what you're saying. We didn't have racial segregation in 1985. It was a really nice country that respected itself. I was here. I think with younger people, you can tell them that and they're like, well, 1985 you were selling slaves in Madison Square Garden. It's like, no, they weren't. You're going to Madison Square Garden and not stepping over a single fentanyl addict.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is true, there doesn't have to be a trade off between cleanliness and freedom of speech, but it is also true that in dictatorships, cleanliness and architectural design is easier to achieve and perfect, and often is done so you can show off, look how great our cities are while you're suppressing-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course, of course, I agree with that vehemently. This is not a defense of the Russian system at all. If I felt that way, I would not only move there, but I would announce I was moving there. I'm not ashamed of my views. I never have been.

The fact that we've a carried interest loophole in the tax code and people are claiming that their income is investment, income and they're paying half the tax rate as someone who just goes to work every day, it discourages work. It encourages lending at interest, which I think is gross, personally. I'm against it. Sorry. The fact that we're creating chaos around the world is the saddest thing that's happening right now.

Maybe you're for that, maybe you're against it, but you can't endorse that in the same sentence that you use the term democracy, because that's not a democracy, obviously.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's why it's interesting that he didn't really bring up NATO extensively.<|eot_id|>"}

But imagine if you were Boris Johnson and you spend your whole life with Ukraine flag, \"I'm for Ukraine,\" and then all those kids died because of what you did, and the lines haven't really moved. It hasn't been a victory for Ukraine. It's not going to be a victory for Ukraine. It's like, how do you feel about yourself if you did that? I mean, I've done a lot of shitty things in my life, I feel bad about them, but I've never extended a war for no reason. That's a pretty grave sin in my opinion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes, that was a failure.

Of course he does. He's got 80 whatever republics, and he's afraid of nationalist movements. He fought a war in Chechnya over this. So I understand it, but I have a different...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's primarily an economic threat.\" And maybe all the threats aren't reduced to tank battles, that's the other thing. Is these people are so inelastic in their thinking, so lacking imagination and flexibility, that they can't sort of imagine a new framework. And the new framework is not that you're going to go to war with China over Formosa, Taiwan. No, the framework is that all of a sudden all the infrastructure in Tijuana is going to be built by China, and that's a different kind of threat. But they can't kind of get there because they're not that impressive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you actually have mentioned this, it's not just the Cold War, it's World War II that populates most of their thinking in Washington. You mentioned Churchill, Chamberlain, and Hitler, and they're kind of seeing the World War II as kind of the good war and successful role the United States played in that war.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>seems absurd to me, but absurd things happen. What would I ask Hitler? I don't even know.

What's your goal?\" And then the question is, is he going to answer honestly? I don't know, you can't make someone answer a question honestly. You can only sort of shut up while they talk and then let people decide what they think of the answer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, just like in the bar fight, there's different ways.<|eot_id|>"}

Opening the door to conversation literally is the path to more conversations in peace talks.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I would flip it around and say anyone who seeks to shut that down by focusing on a supermarket video of four minutes versus a two hour and 15 minute long interview with a world leader, anyone who doesn't want more conversation, who wants fewer facts, fewer perspectives is totalitarian, and probably doesn't have good intent.

It's not in me, I don't believe in that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Putin's folks have shown interest for quite a while to speaking with me.

Russian, what?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Plus conversation.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And my understanding of Russian as a lover of Russian literature in English, is that it's not a simple language at all. The grammar's complex, there's a lot that's expressed that will be lost in the translation.

You would get so much more out of it than I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we should say that you've met a lot of world leaders, both Zelenskyy and Putin are intelligent, witty, even funny.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure. And Putin speaks decent English, I spoke to him in English, so I know that, but he's not comfortable with it at all.

Well, he's better than Putin at English, but the humor, the wit, the intelligence, all of that is not quite there in English.

How did he wind up at the vanguard of the deepest conversations in the country? How did that happen? So I definitely respect that and I think it's cool. Rogan is one of those people who just came out of nowhere. No one helped him.
