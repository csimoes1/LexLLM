Saagar is a political commentator, journalist, co-host of Breaking Points with Krystal Ball and of The Realignment podcast with Marshall Kosloff. Saagar is one of the most well-read people I've ever met. His love of history and the wisdom gained from reading thousands of history books radiates through every analysis he makes of the world. In this podcast, we trace out the history of the various ideological movements that led up to the current political moment. In doing so, we mention a large number of amazing books. We'll put a link to them in the description for those interested to learn more about each topic. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Saagar Enjeti. So let's start with the obvious big question, why do you think Trump won? Let's break it down. Before the election, you said that if Trump wins, it's going to be because of immigration. So aside from immigration, what are the maybe less than obvious reasons that Trump won?<|eot_id|>"}

And something I love so much about this country, people change their minds all the time. I was born in 1992, I watched red states go blue. I've seen blue states go red. I've seen swing states go red or blue. I've seen millions of people pick up and move, the greatest internal migration in the United States since World War II. And it's really inspiring because it's a really dynamic, interesting place. And I love covering it and I love thinking about it, talking about it, talking to people. It's awesome.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the reasons I'm a big fan of yours is you're a student of history, and so, you've recommended a bunch of books to me. And they and others thread the different movements throughout American history. Some movements take off and do hold power for a long time, some don't. And some are started by a small number of people and are controlled by a small number of people, some are mass movements. And it's just fascinating to watch how those movements evolve, and then, fit themselves, maybe, into the constraints of a two-party system. And I'd love to talk about the various perspectives of that. So would it be fair to say that this election was turned into a kind of class struggle?<|eot_id|>"}

And I actually think that's what this revolution of Donald Trump was activating and bringing people to the polls, bringing a lot of those traditional working class voters of all races away from the Democratic Party along the lines of elitism, of sneering, and of a general cultural feeling that these people don't understand me and my struggles in this life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so, the trivial formulation is the woke-ism and the anti woke-ism a movement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's not necessarily that Trump winning was a statement against woke-ism, it was the broader anti-elitism?<|eot_id|>"}

So there's a lot of roots to this, The Managerial Revolution by James Burnham. And in terms of the origin of how we got here, but the crystallization of DEI and/or affirmative action, I prefer to use the term affirmative action, in the highest echelons of business. And there became this idea that representation itself was the only thing that mattered. And I think that right around 2014, that really went on steroids, and that's why it's not an accident that Donald J. Trump elected in 2016.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At this point, do you think this election is the kind of statement that woke-ism as a movement is dead?<|eot_id|>"}

In operation, it means affirmative action, it means the NASDAQ passing some law that if you want to go public or something, that you have to have a woman and a person of color on your board. This is a blatant and extraordinary, look, racialism that they've enshrined in their bylaws. So you can get rid of ESG, that's great, you can get rid of DEI, I think that's great, but it's really about a mindset and a view of the world, and I don't think that's going anywhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you think the reason it doesn't work well in practice is because there's a big degree to which it's anti-meritocracy.<|eot_id|>"}

So these are two ideologies which are really at odds. In a lot of ways, woke-ism, racialism and all this is a third world ideology. It's one that's very prevalent in Europe and all across Asia, but it doesn't mix well here, and it shouldn't. And I'm really glad that America feels the same way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I got to go back to Jim Webb in that book.

And that to the degree, many of the things that kind of identify as American and part of the American spirit were defined by this relatively small group of people as he describes the motto could be summarized as fight, sing, drink and pray. So there's the principles of fierce individualism, the principles of a deep distrust of government, the elites, the authorities, bottom-up governance, over 2,000 years of a military tradition. They made up 40% of the Revolutionary War Army and produced numerous military leaders including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, George S.

So this giant organization that's just doing things how it's always been done. And the government politics model of there's just these individual internal power struggles within government.

So the whole system is nuts right now, and we need complete systematic reform that burns it all to the ground.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, the image and the reality of a child being separated from their parents seems deeply un-American, right?<|eot_id|>"}

Illegal immigration is great for big business. It is great for big agriculture. So if you want the lowest prices of all time, then yeah, mass deportation is a terrible idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, very convincing, and second of all, I mean, you can't just do mass deportation without also fixing the immigration system, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>another really sad part is ... What I mean by second class citizenship is this presumption, first of all, that Americans think it's too disgusting to process meat or to work in a field. I think anybody will do anything for the right wage, first of all, but second is the conditions in a lot of those facilities are horrible and they're covered up for a reason, not only in terms of the way that businesses, they actually conduct themselves, but also to cover up their illegal immigrant workforce. So honestly, I think it could make things better for everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have studied how government works.

I mean, nobody even knows how many people are here illegally. It could be 20 million, it could be 30 million. I've seen estimates of up to 30 million, which is crazy. That's almost 1/11 of the entire US population.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What number do you think will feel like mass deportation? One million people?<|eot_id|>"}

Yes, he can do his antics, which got him elected. At this point, we can't deny it. The McDonald's thing is hilarious. It's funny. It is. People love it. People like the podcasting.

And I saw no evidence of that that he provided. And all right, let's put that on the table. And then the other thing I was troubled by, that maybe you can comfort me in the context of history, how easily the base ate that up. That they were able to believe the election was truly rigged based on no clear evidence that I saw. And they just love the story. And there is something compelling to the story, like this DNC type.

That's an insane time to be alive. What do we know? They worked out. By 1890s or so, there were people shaking hands, union and there's a cool video on YouTube actually of FDR who is addressing some of the last Gettysburg veterans. I think it was the 75th anniversary or whatever. You can literally see these old men shaking hands across the stone wall. It gives me hope. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's linger on that hope.

There's no other place that you can just reset your whole life in the same country. It's wild. You can reinvent yourself. You can go broke. You can get rich. You can go back and forth multiple times, and there's nowhere else where you have enough freedom and opportunity to pursue that.
