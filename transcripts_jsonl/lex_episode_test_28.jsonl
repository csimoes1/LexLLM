{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar-winning actor, who has starred in Se7en, The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, and House of Cards. He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting performances of characters who often embody the dark side of human nature. Seven years ago, he was cut from House of Cards, and canceled by Hollywood and the world, when Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986. Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million. In this trial and all civil and criminal trials that followed, Kevin was acquitted. He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law. In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do. I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten and Alison Pearson interviews, for additional details and responses to the allegations. As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life is that I will talk with everyone with empathy and with backbone. For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work, life's story, and what and how they think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance and the flaws. I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to a worse possible caricature of their sins either. The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final judgment before the facts are in. I will try to do better than that, to respect due process in service of the truth, and I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly from the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me. Again, my goal is to understand human beings at their best and at their worst, and the hope is such understanding leads to more compassion and wisdom in the world. I will make mistakes, and when I do, I will work hard to improve. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey. You played a serial killer in the movie, Se7en. Your performance was one of, if not the greatest, portrayal of a murderer on screen ever. What was your process of becoming him, John Doe, the serial killer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>had this feeling that it would be really good if I didn't take billing in the film, and the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the time this film would come out, it would be the last one of the three movies that I'd just shot, the fourth one. And if any of those films broke through or did well, if it was going to be Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for the first 25, 30, 40 minutes, people are going to figure out who you're playing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So people didn't know that you play the serial killer in the movie, and the serial killer shows up more than halfway through the movie.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Very latest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And when you say billing, is like the posters, the VHS cover.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Everything. You're gone.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>military character, and I just looked at the hairdresser and I said, do you have a razor? And Fincher went, \"Are you kidding?\" And I said, \"No.\" He goes, \"If you shave your head, I'll shave mine.\" So we both shaved our heads, and then I started shooting the next day. So my long-winded answer to your question is that I didn't have that much time to think about how to build that character. What I think in the end, Fincher was able to do so brilliantly, with such terror, was to set the audience up to meet this character.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the last scene, the ending scene, and the car ride leading up to it, where it's mostly on you in conversation with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, it's one of the greatest scenes in film history. So people who somehow didn't see the movie, there's these five murders that happened that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins, and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins, and there's this calm subtlety about you in your performance, it's just terrifying. Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but that in the contrast is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience, that builds up to the twist at the end, or the surprise at the end, with the famous, \"What's in the box?\" from Brad Pitt, that is Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>difficult. Very often, tragedy is people operating without enough information. They don't have all the facts. Romeo and Juliet, they don't have all the facts. They don't know what we know as an audience. And so in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character ends up shooting John Doe, or turning the gun on himself, which was a discussion ... there were a number of alternative endings that were discussed ... nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow. It is complicated, and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating with all the information.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you say, \"Say the words and mean them,\" what does the, \"mean them,\" mean?<|eot_id|>"}

He said, \"Jack, let's do another one this time just a little bit less,\" and Jack said, \"Less than what I just did now?\" He said, \"Yeah, just a little bit less.\" He goes, \"Oh, okay.\" So he did another take and Cukor came up and he said, \"Jack, just a little bit less,\" and Jack said, \"A little less than what I just did?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He goes, \"Well, if I do any less, I'm not going to be acting,\" and Cukor said, \"Exactly, Jack. Exactly.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess what you're saying is, it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom of a little less, because the power, if we just stick even on Se7en, of your performances, in the tiniest of subtleties, like when you say, \"Oh, you didn't know,\" and you turn your head a little bit, and a little bit, maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face. That's subtlety, that's less, that's hard to get to, I suppose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence, and it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions he had to go through, and then the decision of, \"What do I do, because if I do what he wants me to do, then he wins. But if I don't do it, then what kind of a man, husband am I?\" I just thought he did really incredible work. So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what he was throwing at me. I just thought it was a really extraordinary scene.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's it like being in that scene? So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Brad Pitt is going over the top, just having a mental breakdown, and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices, as you're saying. But he's screaming, and in pain, and tormented, while you're very subtly smiling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In terms of the writing and in terms of what the characters had to do, it was an incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did, and in the end, succeed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned Fincher likes to do a lot of takes. That's the famous thing about David Fincher. So what are the pros and cons of that? I think I read that he does some crazy amount. He averages 25 to 65 takes, and most directors do less than 10.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sometimes it's timing, sometimes it's literally he has a stopwatch, and he's timing how long a scene is taking, and then he'll say, \"You need to take a minute off this scene.\" \" A minute?\" \"Yeah, a minute off this scene. I want it to move like this. So let's pick it up. Let's pick up the pace. Let's see if we can take a minute off.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why the speed? Why say it fast is the important thing for him, do you think?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think because Fincher hates indulgence, and he wants people to talk the way they do in life, which is we don't take big dramatic pauses before we speak. We speak, we say what we want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I guess actors like the dramatic pauses, and the indulge in the dramatic-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>spoke, not just in the comedies, which, of course, you look at any Preston Sturges' movie, and it's incredible how fast people are talking, and how funny things are when they happen that fast. But then acting styles changed. We got into a different thing in the late '50s and '60s, and a lot of actors are feeling it, which I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just that if you want to keep an audience engaged, as Fincher does, and I believe successfully does in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed, are admirable to achieve.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible, to strip away all the bullshit of acting-<|eot_id|>"}

But let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room,\" because I was so excited to capture this character. So very often ... Trevor Nunn is this way, a lot of wonderful directors I've worked with, they're really good at helping you trim and edit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>David Fincher said about you ... he was talking in general, I think, but also specifically in the moment of House of Cards ... said that you have exceptional skill, both as an actor and as a performer, which he says are different things. So he defines the former as dramatization of a text, and the latter as the seduction of an audience. Do you see wisdom in that distinction? And what does it take to do both the dramatization of a text and the seduction of an audience?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself, because I'll be in the right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style. I'll have embraced what a director's ... it's not my painting, it's someone else's painting. I'm a series of colors in someone else's painting, and the barometer for me has always been, that when people stop me and talk to me about a character I've played, and reference their name as if they actually exist, that's when I feel like I've gotten close to doing my job.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters, because they live deeply in the psyche.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Hepburn. I believed who they were. I knew nothing about them. They were just these extraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff. And then I think more ... recently contemporary, when I think of the work that Philip Seymour Hoffman did, and Heath Ledger, and people that, when I think about what they could be doing, what they could do, what they would've done had they stayed with us, I'm so excited when I go into a cinema, or I go into a play, and I completely am taken to some place that I believe exists, and characters that become real.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And those characters become lifelong companions. For me, they travel with you, and even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature, they're always there. In feel like I almost met them, and gotten to know them, and gotten to become friends with them, almost. Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump, I feel like I'm best friends with Forrest Gump.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I think that everybody feels like that when they're in the audience with great characters, they just become part of you in some way, the good, the bad, and the ugly of them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you haven't thought of asking yet.\" I realized that the playwright wrote the last round, the eighth round between these two brothers, and it was a fight, physical as well as emotional. And when I brought that into the rehearsal room to the directors doing that play, he liked that idea. And we staged that scene as if it was the eighth round. The audience wouldn't have known that, but just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me, \"Ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean? And then work backwards.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is that? Like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is magical about this play, this story, this narrative? That's what that is? Thinking backwards. That's what that does?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But also because it's this incredible, \"Why didn't I think to ask that question myself?\" That's what you have directors for. That's what you have ... so many places where ideas can come from, but that just illustrates that even though in my brain I go, \"I always like to work backwards,\" I missed it in that one. And I'm very grateful to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant, and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To ask the interesting question. I like the poetry and the humility of, \"I'm just a series of colors in someone else's painting.\" That was a good line. That said, you've talked about improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again, and yet never make it the same, and you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text. So where's the room for the improvisation, that it's never the same?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fellow actors grow in theirs, and how every night it's a new audience, and they're reacting differently, and you literally ... where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the difference between theater and film is that no matter how good someone might think you are in a movie, you'll never be any better. It's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow night than I was tonight. I can be better in a week than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing, shifting, changing, growing thing, every single day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also in theater, there's no safety net. If you fuck it up, everybody gets to see you do that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And if you start giggling on stage, everyone gets to see you do that too, which I am very guilty of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is something of a seduction of an audience in theater, even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch the documentary, Now in the Wings on a World Stage, which is behind the scenes of ... you mentioned you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage Richard III, a play by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn, you haven't really done Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie, but there's a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes stuff there. First of all, the camaraderie of everybody, the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling. But another interesting thing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes, trying different stuff, it seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves, taking risks, all of that. I suppose that's part of acting in general, but theater especially, just take risks. It's okay to embarrass the shit out of yourself, including the director.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>whole movie together. Every single day, when you show up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day. You're learning, you're growing, you're trying, and there is an incredible trust that happens. And I was, of course, fortunate that some of the things I learned and observed about being a part of that family, being included in that family, and being a part of creating that family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon, who led many companies that I was fortunate to work in and be a part of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's also a sad moment where at the end, everybody is really sad to say goodbye, because you do form a family and then it's over. I guess, somebody said that that's just part of theater. There's a kind of assume goodbye, and that this is it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and also there are some times when six months later, I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and I'll go, \"That's how to play that scene.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Oh, God, I just finally figured it out.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe you could speak a little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and live theater acting?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>camera's right here, you know that your front row is also your back row. You don't have to do so much. There is in theater, a particular kind of energy, almost like an athlete that you have to have vocally to be able to get up seven performances a week and never lose your voice and always be there and always be alive, and always be doing the best work you can that you just don't require in film. You don't have to have the same, it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina that doing a play does.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just feels like also in theater, you have to become the character more intensely because you can't take a break, you can't take a bathroom break, you're on stage, this is you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on on stage with the actors. I mean, I have literally laughed through speeches that I had to give because my fellow actors were putting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever they were doing to make me laugh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they're just having fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're having the time of their life. And by the way, Judi Dench is the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring the curtain down on her and Maggie Smith because they were laughing so hard they could not continue the play.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So even when you're doing a dramatic monologue still, they're still fucking with you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's stuff going...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, that's great. That's good to know. You also said interesting line that improvisation helps you learn about the character. Can you explain that? So through maybe playing with the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life, you get to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I'm now, I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening, but I am reacting. We got to the end of that take.

Oh, that was so good.

Jack was sitting in a chair and Pacino's office doing the New York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day. And I walked in the door and he went, \"Oh, Jesus Christ, is it possible you could get a job without me? Jesus Christ, I'm so tired of holding up your end of it. Oh my God, Jesus.\" So I got the job because of Pacino, and it was really one of the first major roles that I ever had in a film to be working with that group-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's one of the greatest ensemble casts ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, you, Jonathan Pryce. It's just incredible. And I have to say, I mean maybe you can comment. You've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack Lemmon has been, that's one of his greatest performances ever.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor, unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate sometimes, maybe shocking.

And I'm sure that there's some people who have done both.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, man. So you mentioned American Beauty and the idea of not changing, but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about finding yourself. It's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters in their own ways, finding their own identity in a world where maybe a system, a materialistic system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester really transforms himself throughout the movie. And you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same human being fundamentally.<|eot_id|>"}

It wasn't our intention.\" But it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I admired so much about who Lester was as a person, why I wanted to play him is because in the end, he makes the right decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think a lot of people live lives of quiet desperation in a job they don't like in a marriage they're unhappy in. And to see somebody living that life and then saying, \"Fuck it,\" in every way possible, and not just in a cynical way, but in a way that opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's the beauty in American Beauty.<|eot_id|>"}

And Sam said it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could possibly have happened in my first two days. And after that, I was like, \"I know what I'm doing. And I knew I had to re-shoot it, and it was absolutely right.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I guess that's what a great director must do, is have the guts in that moment to re-shoot everything.

This movie's about taking the time to look closer.\" And I think that in itself is just beautiful.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time with him, I'm just moved by every day. He gets up and he goes, \"It's a good day. I woke up.\" And I learn a lot... I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago, and I am on the path to being able to be in a place where I've resolved the things I needed to resolve, and I won't probably get to all of it in my lifetime, but I certainly would like to be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow, it would've been an amazing life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Lester got there.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you feared death at your lowest point. What was the lowest point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was November 1st, 2017 and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's talk about it. Let's talk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual allegations against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world for the last seven years. I would like to personally understand the sins, the bad things you did, and the bad things you didn't do. So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here is to give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty, that the mass hysteria machine of the internet and click bait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand, there were criminal and civil trials brought against you, including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million. In these trials, you were acquitted, found not guilty and not liable. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think that's really important, again, in terms of due process. I read a lot and I watched a lot in preparation for this, on this point, including of course the recently detailed interviews you did with Dan Wooten and then Allison Pearson of The Telegraph, and those were all focused on this topic and they go in detail where you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that, and everything I looked at, as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to, sort of in the sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You always respected the explicit, \"No\" from people, again in the sexual context. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Never.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also, as it's sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this. You've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement, correct?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In terms of bad behavior, what did you do? What was the worst of it? And how often did you do it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I have heard, and now quite often, that everybody has a Kevin Spacey story, and what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How often did you cross the line and what does that mean to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at the time I thought were sort of playful and fun, and I have learned since were not. And I have had to recognize that I crossed some boundaries and I did some things that were wrong and I made some mistakes, and that's in my past. I mean, I've been working so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations I needed to have, to listen to people, to understand things from a different perspective than the one that I had and to say, \"I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to clarify, I think you are often too pushy with the flirting and that manifests itself in multiple ways. Just to make clear, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to. You always took the explicit, \"No\" from people as an answer. \"No, stop.\" You took that for the answer. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person and you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement. These are some of the accusations that have been made and in the court of law multiple times have been shown not to be true.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>discussed, but that's who I know. That's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have said, I mean, I don't have a violent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that I ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is crushing to me, and I have to work very hard to show and to prove that I have learned. I got the memo and I will never, ever, ever behave in those ways again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From everything I've seen in public interactions with you people love you, colleagues love you, coworkers love you. There's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between the people you work with.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and ending up marrying each other and having children. And so it is a space and a place where these notions of family, these notions of attraction, these notions of... It's always complicated if you meet someone in the workspace and find yourselves attracted to each other. You have to be mindful of that, and you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to feel that their job is in jeopardy or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted to be with you. So those are important things to just acknowledge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another complexity to this, as I've seen, is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you, a huge number of people in the industry that look up to you and love you. I've seen just from this documentary, just a lot of people just love being around you, learning from you what it means to create great theater, great film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's an admiration dynamic that is easy to miss and easy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>These are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices, and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of things that I've been accused of that just simply did not happen, and I can't say, and I don't think it would be right for me to say, \"Well, everything that's ever been I've been accused of is true,\" because we've now proved that it isn't and it wasn't. But I'm perfectly willing to accept that I had behaviors that were wrong and that I shouldn't have done, and I am regretful for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think that also speaks to a dark side of fame. The sense I got is that there are some people, potentially a lot of people, trying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career. So not you using them, but they trying to use you. What's that like? How do you know if somebody likes you for you, for Kevin, or likes you for, you said you're a romantic, you see a person and you're like, \"I like this person,\" and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>look, one shouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say, you said a little while ago that the world had canceled me, and I have to disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years I've been stopped by people sometimes every day, sometimes multiple, multiple times a day. And the conversations that I have with people, the generosity that they share, the kindness that they show and how much they want to know when I'm getting back to work tells me that while there may be a very loud minority, there is a quieter majority.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the industry have you been betrayed in life? And how do you not let that make you cynical?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think betrayal is a really interesting word, but I think if you're going to be betrayed, it has to be by those who truly know you. And I can tell you that I have not been betrayed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a beautiful way to put it. For the times you crossed the line, do you take responsibility for the wrongs you've done?<|eot_id|>"}

I will admit that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, from the public perception, the first part of that. So first of all, the second part is a horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. And then the first part from the public viewpoint, they see guilt in that which also is tragic because at least that particular accusation, and it's a very dramatic one, it's a $40 million lawsuit, it's a big deal, and an underage person, was shown to be false.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to say, \"This person's a liar\"? Or is your first instinct to go, \"What?

But at the moment, I was sort of being told I couldn't push back. You have to be kind. You can't... I think even to me now, none of it sounds right.

Let's go to the beginning of that show, one of the greatest TV series of all time, a dark fascinating character in Frank Underwood, a ruthless, cunning, borderline evil politician.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wonderful stories that you can read in old books about Shakespeare's time, that actors grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him against a wall and said, \"You ever write a part like this again? I'm going to kill you.\" And that's why in later plays, he started to have a pageant happened, and then a wedding happened and the main character was off stage resting because the actor had said, \"You can't do this to us. There's no breaks.\" And it's true, there's very few breaks in Richard III. You're on stage most of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The comedic aspect of Richard III and Frank Underwood, is that a component that helps bring out the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we can see five different Hamlets. We can see four Richard IIIs, we can see two Richard IIs. That's part of the thrill, that we don't own these parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role could be completely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it. And also very often in terms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say, \"Why don't you say that with a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with a bit of blah, blah, blah?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's often a wry smile. The line that jumps to me, when you're talking about Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, \"I love that woman more than sharks love blood.\" I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together.<|eot_id|>"}

I need at least two more words to rhythmically make this work in his accent because it just doesn't scan.\" And that's not iambic pentameter. I'm not talking about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare. But there was sometimes when it's too many lines, it's not enough lines, in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds and what that accent does to emphasis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much of that character in terms of the musicality of the way he speaks, is Bill Clinton?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this, there's 2,000 people at the Brooks Atkinson Theater watching President Clinton watching this play. And at the end of the night we take our curtain call, they bring out the presidential podium, Bill Clinton stands up there and he says, \"Well, I suppose we should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors for giving us all way too much to think about.\" And the audience fell over in laughter. And then he gave a great speech. And I thought, \"That was a pretty good way to handle that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, in that way, him and Frank Underwood share like a charisma. There's certain presidents that just have, politicians that just have this charisma. You can't stop listening to them.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all. We had complete creative control, but over time they started to get themselves involved because look, this is what happens to networks. They'd never made a television show before, ever. And then. They'd never made a television show before, ever. And then four years later, they were the best. And so then you're going to get suggestions about casting, and about writing, and about music and scenes. And so there was a considerable amount of pushback that I had to do when they started to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting the quality of the show.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are those battles like? I heard that there was a battle with the execs, like you mentioned early on about your name not being on the billing for Seven. I heard that there's battles about the ending of Seven, which was really... Well, it was pretty dark. So what's that battle like? How often does that happen, and how do you win that battle? Because it feels like there's a line where the networks or the execs are really afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place, and then great directors and great actors kind of flirt with that line.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>an entire season over a weekend.\" So there are those kind of arguments that can happen. There's different arguments on different levels, and they sometimes have to do with... I mean, look, go back to The Godfather, they wanted to fire Pacino because they didn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening, so they wanted to fire Pacino. And then finally Coppola thought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner, and I'll do that scene now. And that was the first scene where they went, \"Yeah, actually there's something going on there.\" So Pacino kept the role.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think that Godfather's when the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like there's the character that really over the top in Scent of a Woman? There's stages, I suppose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that we can't forget that Pacino is also an animal of the theater. He does a lot of plays, and he started off doing plays, and movies were... Panic in Needle Park was his first. And yeah, I think there's that period of time when he was doing some incredible parts, incredible movies. When I did a series called Wiseguy, I got cast on a Thursday, and I flew up to Vancouver on a Saturday, and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time to do was watch The Godfather and Serpico, and then I went to work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would you say... Ridiculous question, Godfather, greatest film of all time? Gun to your head, right now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Certainly, yes. But look, I'm allowed to change my opinion. I can next week say it's Lawrence of Arabia, or a week after that I can say Sullivan's Travels. I mean, that's the wonderful thing about movies, and particularly great movies, is when you see them again, it's like seeing them for the first time, and you pick up things that you didn't see the last time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And for that day you fall in love with that movie, and you might even say to a friend that that is the greatest movie of all time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And also I think it's the degree with which directors are daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to one actor to play three major roles in Dr. Strangelove. I mean, who has the balls to do that today?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was going to mention when we're talking Seven, that just if you're looking at the greatest performances, portrayals of murderers. So obviously, like I mentioned, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, that's up there. Seven to me is competing for first place with Silence of the Lambs. But then there's a different one with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson with The Shining. And there as opposed to a murderer who's always been a murderer, here's a person, like in American Beauty, who becomes that, who descends into madness. I read also that Jack Nicholson improvised, \"Here's Johnny.\" In that scene.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I believe that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a very different performance than yours in Seven, what do you make of that performance?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Nicholson's always been such an incredible actor, because he has absolutely no shame about being demonstrative and over the top. And he also has no problem playing characters who are deeply flawed, and he's interested in that. I have a pretty good Nicholson story though, nobody knows.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You also have a good Nicholson impression, but what's the story?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"What film did we do together?\" He says, \"Well, we did Missouri Breaks.\" Nicholson goes, \"Oh, my God, Missouri breaks, Jesus Christ, we were out of our minds on that film, holy shit. Jesus Christ, it's a wonder I'm alive, my God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds, holy shit.\" Just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and an eighth of coke drops out onto the floor. Dennis looks at it, Nicholson looks at it, Jack goes, \"Haven't worn these pants since Missouri Breaks.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Man, I love that guy, unapologetically himself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your impression of him at the AFT is just great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that was for Mike Nichols.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, he had a big impact in your career.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A huge impact.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Really important. Can you talk about him? What role did he play in your life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>let me come and watch when they were shooting scenes I wasn't in. And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer, on the same day we were working, Jack and Me, we had no scene together. But I remember him coming in, and they put him down in the chair, and they put frozen cucumbers on his eyes, and did his neck, and then they raised him up and did his face. And then I remember Nicholson went like this, looked in the mirror, and he went, \"Another day, another $50,000.\" And walked out of the trailer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was Christopher Walken like? So he's a theater guy too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah, he started out as a chorus boy, dancer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I could see that, the guy knows how to move.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Walken's fun, I've know him Walken a long time. And I did a Saturday Night Live where we did these Star Wars auditions, so I did Chris Walken as Han Solo. And I'll never forget this, I was in Los Angeles about two weeks after and I was at Chateau Marmont, there's some party happening at Chateau Marmont. And I saw Chris Walken come onto the balcony, and I was like, \"Oh, shit, it's Christopher Walken.\" And he walked up to... And he went, \"Kevin, I saw your little sketch, it was funny, ha ha.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there's certain people that are truly unique, and unapologetic, continue being that throughout their whole career. The way they talk, the musicality of how they talk, how they are, their way of being, he's that. And it somehow works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"This watch.\" Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he works in so many different contexts, he plays a mobster in True Romance, and it's genius, that's genius. But he could be anything, he could be soft, he could be a badass, all of it. And he's always Christopher Waken, but somehow works for all these different characters. So I guess we were talking about House of Cards two hours ago before we took a tangent upon a tangent. But there's a moment in episode one where President Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him the Secretary of State. Was this when the monster in Frank was born or was the monster always there? For you looking at that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's loyalty and that broke him? Or did he always know that this whole world is about manipulation, and do anything to get power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start to get to know him, and learn about his life, and learn about his father, and learn about his friends, and learn about their relationship, and learn what he was like even as a cadet, I think you start to realize that this is a man who has very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that in terms of the storyline that's being built. Knight Takes King was the name of our production company.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show? Was it all about power and also legacy, or was there some small part underneath it all where he wanted to actually do good in the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I think power is a afterthought, what he loved more than anything was being able to predict how human beings would react, he was a behavioral psychologist. And he was 17 moves ahead in the chess game, he could know if he did this at this moment, that eventually this would happen, he was able to be predictive and was usually right. He knew just how far he needed to push someone to get them to do what he needed them to do in order to make the next step work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've played a bunch of evil characters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I have played or that any actor has played don't necessarily view themselves as this label, it's easy to say, but that's not the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I play and then play them well, I have to be free of judgment, I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use that word is perfectly fine, that's your... But it's like people asking me, \"Was I really from K-PAX or not?\" It just entirely depends on your perspective.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do roles like that, like Seven, like Frank Underwood, like Lester from American Beauty, do they change you psychologically as a person? So walking around in the skin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral systems.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I absolutely believe that wandering around in someone else's ideas, in someone else's clothes, in someone else's shoes teaches you enormous empathy. And that goes to the heart of not judging. And I have found that I have been so moved by... I mean, look, yes, you've identified the darker characters, but I played Clarence Darrow three times, I've played a play called National Anthems, I've done movies like Recount. I've done films like The Ref, I've done films that in which that doesn't exist in any of those characters, those qualities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pay It Forward.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pay It Forward. And so it is incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me, and those things that I don't admire and aren't like me. But I have to put them on an equal footing and say, \"I have to just play them as best I can.\" And not decide to wield judgment over them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Without judgment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Without judgment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously writes about the line between good and evil, and that it runs to the heart of every man. So the full paragraph there when he talks about the line, \"During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place, sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil, and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times, he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.\" What do you think about this note, that we're all capable of good and evil, and throughout life that line moves and shifts throughout the day, throughout every hour?<|eot_id|>"}
