{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar-winning actor, who has starred in Se7en, The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, and House of Cards. He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting performances of characters who often embody the dark side of human nature. Seven years ago, he was cut from House of Cards, and canceled by Hollywood and the world, when Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986. Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million. In this trial and all civil and criminal trials that followed, Kevin was acquitted. He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law. In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do. I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten and Alison Pearson interviews, for additional details and responses to the allegations. As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life is that I will talk with everyone with empathy and with backbone. For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work, life's story, and what and how they think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance and the flaws. I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to a worse possible caricature of their sins either. The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final judgment before the facts are in. I will try to do better than that, to respect due process in service of the truth, and I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly from the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me. Again, my goal is to understand human beings at their best and at their worst, and the hope is such understanding leads to more compassion and wisdom in the world. I will make mistakes, and when I do, I will work hard to improve. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description, and now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey. You played a serial killer in the movie, Se7en. Your performance was one of, if not the greatest, portrayal of a murderer on screen ever. What was your process of becoming him, John Doe, the serial killer.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think in the end, Fincher was able to do so brilliantly, with such terror, was to set the audience up to meet this character.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the last scene, the ending scene, and the car ride leading up to it, where it's mostly on you in conversation with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, it's one of the greatest scenes in film history. So people who somehow didn't see the movie, there's these five murders that happened that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins, and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins, and there's this calm subtlety about you in your performance, it's just terrifying. Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but that in the contrast is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience, that builds up to the twist at the end, or the surprise at the end, with the famous, \"What's in the box?\" from Brad Pitt, that is Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>up in a nice little bow.

Exactly.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess what you're saying is, it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom of a little less, because the power, if we just stick even on Se7en, of your performances, in the tiniest of subtleties, like when you say, \"Oh, you didn't know,\" and you turn your head a little bit, and a little bit, maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face. That's subtlety, that's less, that's hard to get to, I suppose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>also not easy to not react to the power of what he was throwing at me. I just thought it was a really extraordinary scene.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's it like being in that scene? So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Brad Pitt is going over the top, just having a mental breakdown, and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices, as you're saying. But he's screaming, and in pain, and tormented, while you're very subtly smiling.<|eot_id|>"}

That's the famous thing about David Fincher. So what are the pros and cons of that? I think I read that he does some crazy amount. He averages 25 to 65 takes, and most directors do less than 10.<|eot_id|>"}

Trevor Nunn is this way, a lot of wonderful directors I've worked with, they're really good at helping you trim and edit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>David Fincher said about you ... he was talking in general, I think, but also specifically in the moment of House of Cards ... said that you have exceptional skill, both as an actor and as a performer, which he says are different things. So he defines the former as dramatization of a text, and the latter as the seduction of an audience. Do you see wisdom in that distinction?

I like the poetry and the humility of, \"I'm just a series of colors in someone else's painting.\" That was a good line. That said, you've talked about improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again, and yet never make it the same, and you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text. So where's the room for the improvisation, that it's never the same?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was tonight. I can be better in a week than I was tonight.

I got a chance to watch the documentary, Now in the Wings on a World Stage, which is behind the scenes of ... you mentioned you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage Richard III, a play by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn, you haven't really done Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie, but there's a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes stuff there. First of all, the camaraderie of everybody, the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling. But another interesting thing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes, trying different stuff, it seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves, taking risks, all of that. I suppose that's part of acting in general, but theater especially, just take risks. It's okay to embarrass the shit out of yourself, including the director.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon, who led many companies that I was fortunate to work in and be a part of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's also a sad moment where at the end, everybody is really sad to say goodbye, because you do form a family and then it's over.

You don't have to have the same, it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina that doing a play does.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just feels like also in theater, you have to become the character more intensely because you can't take a break, you can't take a bathroom break, you're on stage, this is you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because my fellow actors were putting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever they were doing to make me laugh.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they're just having fun.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's stuff going...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, that's great. That's good to know. You also said interesting line that improvisation helps you learn about the character. Can you explain that?

That's really interesting because that movie is about finding yourself. It's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters in their own ways, finding their own identity in a world where maybe a system, a materialistic system that wants you to be like everyone else.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you feared death at your lowest point. What was the lowest point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was November 1st, 2017 and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's talk about it. Let's talk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual allegations against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world for the last seven years. I would like to personally understand the sins, the bad things you did, and the bad things you didn't do. So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here is to give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty, that the mass hysteria machine of the internet and click bait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand, there were criminal and civil trials brought against you, including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million. In these trials, you were acquitted, found not guilty and not liable. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think that's really important, again, in terms of due process. I read a lot and I watched a lot in preparation for this, on this point, including of course the recently detailed interviews you did with Dan Wooten and then Allison Pearson of The Telegraph, and those were all focused on this topic and they go in detail where you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that, and everything I looked at, as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to, sort of in the sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You always respected the explicit, \"No\" from people, again in the sexual context. Is that right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Never.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also, as it's sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this. You've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement, correct?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In terms of bad behavior, what did you do? What was the worst of it? And how often did you do it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and now quite often, that everybody has a Kevin Spacey story, and what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How often did you cross the line and what does that mean to you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a different perspective than the one that I had and to say, \"I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to clarify, I think you are often too pushy with the flirting and that manifests itself in multiple ways. Just to make clear, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to. You always took the explicit, \"No\" from people as an answer. \"No, stop.\" You took that for the answer. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person and you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement. These are some of the accusations that have been made and in the court of law multiple times have been shown not to be true.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hard to show and to prove that I have learned. I got the memo and I will never, ever, ever behave in those ways again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From everything I've seen in public interactions with you people love you, colleagues love you, coworkers love you. There's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between the people you work with.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted to be with you. So those are important things to just acknowledge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another complexity to this, as I've seen, is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you, a huge number of people in the industry that look up to you and love you. I've seen just from this documentary, just a lot of people just love being around you, learning from you what it means to create great theater, great film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's an admiration dynamic that is easy to miss and easy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wasn't. But I'm perfectly willing to accept that I had behaviors that were wrong and that I shouldn't have done, and I am regretful for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think that also speaks to a dark side of fame. The sense I got is that there are some people, potentially a lot of people, trying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career. So not you using them, but they trying to use you. What's that like? How do you know if somebody likes you for you, for Kevin, or likes you for, you said you're a romantic, you see a person and you're like, \"I like this person,\" and they seem to like you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going to be betrayed, it has to be by those who truly know you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Don't hold back now. Come on. Really tell me how you feel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The first part, you kind of implicitly admitted to doing something bad, which was later shown and proved completely to never have happened.

Yes, we all agree. And then the first part from the public viewpoint, they see guilt in that which also is tragic because at least that particular accusation, and it's a very dramatic one, it's a $40 million lawsuit, it's a big deal, and an underage person, was shown to be false.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>even to me now, none of it sounds right.

As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out in support of you recently, speaking to your character. A lot of people who know you, and some of whom I know who have worked with you privately, show support for you, but are afraid to speak up publicly. What do you make of that?

Let's go to the beginning of that show, one of the greatest TV series of all time, a dark fascinating character in Frank Underwood, a ruthless, cunning, borderline evil politician. What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through for becoming Frank Underwood? Maybe Richard III. There's a lot of elements there in your performance that maybe inspired that character. Is that fair or no?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was never a cut. When we went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader. But-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's interesting because you're doing a bunch of, with both Richard III and Frank Underwood, a bunch of dark, borderline evil things.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the remarkable thing, is against their instincts and their better sense of what they should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I saw even with the documentary, the glimmers of that with Richard III.

The line that jumps to me, when you're talking about Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, \"I love that woman more than sharks love blood.\" I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together.<|eot_id|>"}

I heard that there was a battle with the execs, like you mentioned early on about your name not being on the billing for Seven. I heard that there's battles about the ending of Seven, which was really... Well, it was pretty dark. So what's that battle like? How often does that happen, and how do you win that battle?

So obviously, like I mentioned, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, that's up there. Seven to me is competing for first place with Silence of the Lambs. But then there's a different one with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson with The Shining. And there as opposed to a murderer who's always been a murderer, here's a person, like in American Beauty, who becomes that, who descends into madness.

But there's a moment in episode one where President Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him the Secretary of State.

One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times, he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.\" What do you think about this note, that we're all capable of good and evil, and throughout life that line moves and shifts throughout the day, throughout every hour?<|eot_id|>"}
