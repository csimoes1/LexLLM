I know you like them sometimes, only when they agree with you though. That you've lied about this particular instance in the past. Those kids weren't just on the beaches is often stated in articles. Those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that they had operated from. They literally... You could Google it. Mr. Bonnell. You could Google it. Mr. Bonnell. Mr. Finkelstein. With all due respect, you're such a fantastic moron. It's terrifying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine with Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris, Mouin Rabbani and Steven Bonnell, also known online as Destiny. Norm and Benny are historians. Mouin is a Middle East analyst. And Steven is a political commentator and streamer. All four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic. The goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points. It wasn't to get views or likes. I never care about those. And I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care. The goal was to explore together the history, present and future of Israel and Palestine in a free flowing conversation. No time limits, no rules. There was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning, and it only got more intense as we went along. And I quickly realized that this very conversation in a very real human way was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of Israel and Palestine. For some debates, I will step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling. For this, I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges because that emotion in itself spoke volumes. We did talk about the history and the future. But the anger, the frustration, the biting wit, and at times, respect and comradery were all there. Like I said, we did it in an perhaps all too human way. I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics and I will continue to search for hope in the midst of death and destruction, to search for our common humanity in the midst of division and hate. This thing we have going on, human civilization, the whole of it is beautiful and it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris, Mouin Rabbani, and Steven Bonnell. First question is about 1948/ for Israelis, 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the war of independence. For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba, which means catastrophe or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war. What to you is important to understand about the events of 1948 and the period around there, '47, '49, that helps us understand what's going on today and maybe helps us understand the roots of all of this that started even before 1948. I was hoping that Norm could speak first, then Benny, then Mouin, and then Steven. Norm?<|eot_id|>"}

I won't play games with that. I know a lot of people try to prove it's not true. It clearly, in my view, is true. The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution. While Israeli leaders acting on the compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism, found the pretext in the course of the first Arab-Israeli war to expel the indigenous population and expand its borders. I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you, Norm. Norm asked that you make a lengthy statement in the beginning. Benny, I hope it's okay to call everybody by their first name in the name of camaraderie. Norm has quoted several things you said. Perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of 1948 and maybe respond to the things that Norm said.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>leaders advised them to leave or ordered them to leave. And at the end of the war, Israel said they can't return because they just tried to destroy the Jewish state. And that's the basic reality of what happened in '48. The Jews created a state. The Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to create a state before '48 and in the course of the 1948 war. And for that reason, they have no state to this day. The Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state, fought for it, and established it, hopefully lastingly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you say hostility, in case people are not familiar, there was a full on war where Arab states invaded and Israel won that war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>first part was the Arab community in Palestine, its militiamen attacked the Jews from November, 1947. In other words, from the day after the UN Partition Resolution was passed, Arab gunmen were busy shooting up Jews, and that snowballed into a full scale civil war between the two communities in Palestine. In May, 1948, a second stage began in the war in which the Arab states invaded, the new state attacked the new state, and they too were defeated. And thus the state of Israel emerged. In the course of this two stage war, a vast Palestinian refugee problem occurred.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so after that, the transfer, the expulsion, the thing that people call the Nakba happened. Mouin, could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>consisted of raising hundreds of Palestinian villages to the ground, which was systematically implemented and so on. And so Palestinians became a stateless people. Now, what is the most important reason that no Arab state was established in Palestine? Well, since the 1930s, the Zionist leadership and the Hashemite leadership of Jordan, as it's been thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli-British historian Avi Shlaim, essentially colluded to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the late 1940s. There's much more here, but I think those are the key points I would make about 1948.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We may talk about Zionism, Britain, UN assemblies and all the things you mentioned. There's a lot to dig into. So again, if we can keep it to just one statement moving forward, after Steven, if you want to go a little longer. Also, we should acknowledge the fact that the speaking speeds of people here are different. Steven speaks about 10 times faster than me. Steven, if you want to comment on 1948.<|eot_id|>"}

Every single deal is just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don't want a Jewish state anywhere in this region of the world. I would like to engage Professor Morris.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>should be transferred because otherwise, if they stayed and were disloyal to the emergent Jewish state, this would cause endless disturbances, warfare, killing, and so on. So Ben-Gurion and Weizmann latched onto this proposal by the most famous democracy in the world, the British democracy, when they proposed the idea of transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense. And they said, well, if the British say so, we should also advocate it. But they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy, and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So just to clarify, what you're saying is that 47 was an offensive war, not a defensive war-<|eot_id|>"}

Yeah, transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the Palestinian refugee problem. It's a fault of my memory, but the point still stands, it was Professor Morris who introduced this idea in what you might call a big way. Yeah, but I didn't say it was the central to the Zionist experience. You're saying centrality. I never said it was central. I said it was there. The idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, it's okay to respond back and forth. This is great. And also just a quick question, if I may. You're using quotes from Benny, from Professor Morris. It's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect the full context.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would be fine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if we go back to quotes we've said in the past, and you've both here have written, the three of you have written on this topic a lot is we should be careful and just admit like-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's a very simple fact which everybody understands. Ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum. There are real world practical problems. You can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality and turn it into effect. It was the British mandate. There was significant Arab resistance to Zionism, and that resistance was based on the fact, as you said, the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. So you couldn't very well expect the Zionist movement to come out in neon lights and announce, hey, we're going to be expelling you the first chance we get. That's not realistic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Norm.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as I said, Mr. Morris, I have a problem reconciling what you're saying. It either was incidental or it was deeply entrenched. Here I read it's deeply entrenched, two very resonant words, inevitable and inbuilt. Deeply entrenched. I never wrote it. Well, I'm not sure. It's something you just invented. Okay. But it was there. Inevitable and inbuilt. Fine, fine. Let me concede something. The idea of transfer was there. Israel Zangwill, a British Zionist talked about it early on in the century. Even Herzl in some way talked about transferring population. According to your 25 pages everybody talked about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>we keep bringing up this line from the 25 pages and the four pages. We're lucky to have Benny in front of us right now. We don't need to go to the quotes. We can legitimately ask, how central is expulsion to Zionism in its early version of Zionism and whatever Zionism is today, and how much power influence does Zionism and ideology have in Israel and the influence, the philosophy, the ideology of Zionism have on Israel today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what Weizmann and Ben-Gurion wanted. Ben-Gurion was more of a socialist. Weizmann was more of a liberal westerner, but they wanted to establish a social democratic or liberal state in Palestine. And they both envisioned through most of the years of their activity that there would be an Arab minority in that Jewish state. It's true that Ben-Gurion strived to have as small as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish state because he knew that if you want a Jewish majority state, that would be necessary, but it's not something which they were willing to translate into actual policy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just a quick pause to mention that for people who are not familiar, Theodor Herzl we're talking about over a century ago, and everything we've been talking about has been mostly 1948 and before.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Khrushchev could have spelled Bolshevik. But for the period we're talking about, they were Zionists, they were committed to their exclusive state with a minority living on sufferance, or at worst expelled. That was their ideology. And I really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these Western Democrats like Weitzman, and they wanted to live peacefully with their Arabs. Weitzman described the expulsion in 1948 as 'the miraculous clearing of the land.' That doesn't sound like somebody shedding too many tears at the loss of the indigenous population. Let me just respond to the word on sufferance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let him respond.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and they became fully equal citizens. So if the whole idea was they must have a state without Arabs, this didn't happen in '49, and it didn't happen in the subsequent decades. So Professor Morris, then why did you say without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established? Because you are missing the first section of that paragraph, which was they were being assaulted by the Arabs, and as a result, a Jewish state could not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Norm, I'm officially forbidding you referencing that again. Hold on a second, wait. We responded to it. So the main point you're making, we have to take Benny at his word, is there was a war, and that's the reason why he made that statement.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not interrupting me, because I only know what's been translated into English, and the English literature on the subject is very small and not scholarly. Now, there may be a Hebrew literature, I don't know, but I was surprised that even Shlomo Ben-Ami, stalwart of his state, fair enough, on this particular point he called it false symmetry. No, no, Steven is right. There was a pull and a push mechanism in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post '48. But there was also a lot of push. A lot of push. That's indisputable. There was push-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And on the point of agreement, on this one brief light of agreement, let us wrap up with this topic of history and move on to modern day. But before that, I'm wondering if we could just say a couple of last words on this topic. Steven?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that Zionists are people of exclusion and supremacy and expulsion, we can find that in diary entries, but we can find that expressed in very real terms on the Arab side, I think in all of their behavior around '48 and earlier, where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli state, it would've been the dispossession of many Jewish people. It probably would've been the expulsion of a lot of them back to Europe. And I think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions of the Arabs versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Benny?<|eot_id|>"}

This is what he did. And the Arabs since then have been trying to whitewash Husseini's role. I'm not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust, but he helped the Germans along in doing what they were doing and supported them in doing that. So this can't be removed from the fact that the Arabs, as you say, paid a price for the Holocaust, but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mouin?<|eot_id|>"}

It is why the Israeli state effectively reduced the Palestinians living within the Israeli state, as citizens of the Israeli state, to second class citizens, on the one hand, promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties, on the other hand, doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab nationalist movements. And that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state, what the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem describes a regime of Jewish supremacy between the river and the sea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're Really tempting a response from the other side on the last few sentences.

If you mean specifically Hamas, we don't have a clear breakdown of how many were- No, I don't mean specifically Hamas.

But we don't know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the numbers here in the details are interesting and important almost from a legal perspective, but if we zoom out, the moral perspective, are Palestinians from Gaza justified in violent resistance?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, Palestinians have the right to resistance. That right includes the right to armed resistance.

I think they found one. Yeah, I think they found one. So, I do not believe that those 15 judges... It was 15 to two? 16 to two, I think. There are 15 in the court plus two, so it's 17, so it's 15 to two. I don't think those 15 judges were incompetent and I certainly don't believe the president of the court, an American, would allow herself to be duped. Well, let me read [inaudible 03:12:19]- Mr. Bonnell-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, let him read.<|eot_id|>"}

Remember what I just told you, the court will rule there was no genocide. I don't expect to be even around when the court reaches its final decision. Why? Why? It'll take a long, long time. Two years, three years. No, I don't think it'll take two or three years. Bosnia, which was admittedly a special type of case, because they were accusing Serbia of sponsoring the Bosnian Serbs, that took I think 17 years from '90- I assume they'll take two or three years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the point you're making, so this is a legal-<|eot_id|>"}

But you don't accept extreme Palestinians- But that's not a crazy [inaudible 03:24:02]- Wait, but you don't accept- What he said isn't Israeli policy. But you don't- ... that's not Israeli policy. But you don't accept- What he said isn't Israeli policy. They let in water. They let in gas. Untrue. Untrue. Untrue. But you don't accept extreme Palestinian statements after they lost their entire country, not just 1200 people. That's a good point. No, no, that's a good point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And on that, on that brief moment of agreement, let's just take a quick pause. We need a smoke break. We need a water break, a bathroom break.<|eot_id|>"}

Mr. Bonnell- Wait, you do know how to pronounce my name. You're mispronouncing it intentionally. He made you an Italian all the time. I'm so [inaudible 03:24:46] by your solicitude for international laws. You should try learning it sometime. It would help you sort out a lot of the civilian deaths. Unfortunately, 15 judges disagree. You could keep citing the judges. You should actually try reading the actual statements. This is tiring. You've invited us to a tiring session.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There you go. How are you guys doing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I feel so strongly about this particular conflict is because there are really important things to discuss, but they will never be discussed. They're not being discussed here. We're not going to talk about like Area A, B, and C or what a transference of territory. So we're going to talk about apartheid. We're not going to talk about the differences in how do you conduct war in an urban environment where people, we're just going to talk about genocide. We're not going to talk about what's a good solution for the Palestinians. We're just going to say ethnic cleansing,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible to be productive over the next two hours and talk about solutions?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>About solutions. I have no idea what to say. I mean, I don't see any solutions on if you wanted a positive end to this discussion, which is what you said at the beginning. I can't contribute to this because I am pessimistic. I don't see anywhere any way forward here, But the solution is easy. The reason why the solution is hard is because the histories and the myths are completely... There's a different factual record.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the things would be good to talk about solutions with the future is going back in all the times that it has failed. So every time-<|eot_id|>"}

That Netanyahu came in and violated the Y Memorandum, the transference. He's going to say all of this and he's not going to bring up anything of the Palestinian side. And then for Camp David, he's going to say that yeah, that Arafat was trying, that the maps and the territorial exchange wasn't good enough, that they were asking Palestinians to make all the concessions, that Israel would've made-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, lay it all out. Lay it out.<|eot_id|>"}

Jacques de Rainier or maybe, yeah, maybe he came up with that number. But it was just they didn't count. They didn't count bodies. They just threw the number out and everybody was happy to blame the Irgun and the Lehi for killing more Arabs than actually- Well, and they put it to good use as well. Well, they said that it helped to precipitate more evacuations. So they were happy. I think Begin in his memoir [inaudible 03:28:33]. Yeah. Yeah. They also use that number.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So first of all, thank you for that heated discussion about the present. I would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for as by way of hope for the future. So when has Israel and Palestine have we been closest to something like a peace settlement, to something that where both sides would be happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of signing off on a two-state deal, meaning acceptance of the existence of a Jewish state. This was really the problem. Of Israel or of a Jewish state? Of a Jewish state, the Jewish state of Israel. He wasn't willing to share Palestine with the Jews and put his name to that. I think he just couldn't do it. That's my reading. But some people say it was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing, but was waiting for slightly better terms. I don't buy that. I don't think so. But other people disagree with me on this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>which is a separate matter from dismantling the Israeli state and its institutions. And again, I haven't reached clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter, I think a two state settlement remains feasible. But I think there are very legitimate questions about its desirability and about whether peace can be achieved in the Middle East with the persistence of an irrational genocidal apartheid regime. Particularly because Israeli society is beginning to develop many extremely, extremely distasteful supremacist, dehumanizing aspects that I think also stand in the way of coexistence that are being fed by this regime.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you look back into history when we're closest to peace, and do you draw any hope from any of them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and some of them don't have any representation at all, like the Blacks in South Africa. That's not a requirement. In Israel itself, the minority, the Arabs do have representation, do have rights, and so on. I don't think Israel is also genocidal. I don't think it's being genocidal. It wasn't so in '48. It wasn't so in '67, and it hasn't been recently in my view. And talk about dismantling Israel and that's what you're talking about is, and I think Steven said it correctly, is counterproductive. It just pushes Israelis further away from willing to give Palestinians anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Please, Norm tell me you have-<|eot_id|>"}

Arafat, when he was asked at Camp David, he kept saying, \"I care about the Lebanese... the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon,\" which came to about 300,000. Those were his priority. Which was a large concession from... whether you accept the number or not, that he wasn't talking about 6 million. He was talking about between 100 and 250,000 over 10 years. Now, the best offer that came from the Palestinians... Excuse me, the best offer that came from Israel was the Olmert offer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we just pretend like we didn't all lay out the exceptionally pessimistic view of a two-state... Hold on a second. Two-state solution? Let's pretend that in five years, in 10 years, a two-state peace settlement is reached.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is able to apply those standards and hold the entire region of Palestine to those standards. Because I think, over time, the mounting pressure from without the international community and the mounting pressure from within because Israel hosts a lot of its own criticism, if we talk about B'Tselem, we talk about Haaretz, Israel will host a lot of its own criticism. I think that that pressure would force Israel towards an actual peace agreement, but it's never going to come through violence. Historically, it hasn't. And in the modern day, violence has just hurt the Palestinians more and more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you paint a picture of the future, now is a good moment for both Palestine and Israel to get new leadership.

It is such a complicated metric they figured out, if you asked me to repeat it now, I couldn't do it.
