He is the CEO of MicroStrategy, founder of Saylor Academy, graduate of MIT. And Michael was one of the most fascinating and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten a chance to explore ideas with. He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives of human civilization and human history, and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains, markets, governments and financial systems. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Michael Saylor. Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems, let's say, five to 10 centuries from now, look back at earth on this early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about money and economics, or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence, consciousness, all the big interesting questions?<|eot_id|>"}

That's what you could look at machine learning, you can look at AI with that perspective, which is how do you represent what's happening efficiently, as efficiently as possible?

So it's an opportunity for you to think, \"Where's my field, my discipline, evolving into?\" I talked to a bunch of librarians, just happen to be friends with librarians. Libraries will probably be evolving, and it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.<|eot_id|>"}

And you should be thanking them and you should respect their time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting. Everything you said is very interesting. But of course, from my perspective and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with, it's just being focused on stuff. In my case, it's like focus on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself, and not caring about anything else. I don't care about views or likes or attention. And that just maintaining that focus is the way, from an individual perspective, you live that life. But yeah, it does seem that the world and technology is rewarding the specialization and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And then that lifts all boats actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to do specific things, and they educate themselves. Just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable and more and more empowered.<|eot_id|>"}

So hopefully when you get out of the way, nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you. What do you think, to do a bit of a callback, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization. It seems like we're engineers at heart. We build cool stuff, better and better use of energy, channeling energy to be productive. Why? What's it all for?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're getting metaphysical on me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Very.

It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. Something... When you step back and look at the entirety of it. A collective of humans, using a beautiful invention or creation, or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music, that seems just right. That's what we're here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that. And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective, the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty.<|eot_id|>"}
