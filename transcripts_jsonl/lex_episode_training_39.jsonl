{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right? So yeah, I hated HBO commentary. I thought at the time, HBO Boxing was obviously the gold standard, but when you really think about boxing at that time, their production, the only thing that changed over 30 years was HD.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Think about a fighter.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you know who goes in there and interviews fighters? Joe Rogan, who has trained and done everything and has the utmost respect for the sport and the athletes. Or you got Daniel Cormier who was a former world champion himself and has actually been through it, done it, knows. And those are the type of people that we put in the booth, people that are actually experienced in it, not these people who've never been in a fight in their fucking life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But they're also, both DC and Rogan are big kids.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>everybody does. I mean, it's the difference between our commentary and what I feel their commentary was. We don't hire paid talking heads. We hire people that have actually been in it, done it, love it, and are super passionate about the sport. And I would say that none of them that ever covered the sport back then were. I don't know if that was Marv Albert or what Albert brother that was, but he sounded like he's a fan of the sport or? Anyway, you got me on this, and once I get on this, I lose my mind.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe we wouldn't have a UFC if they didn't fuck it up so bad for the Tyson walk-up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It would be different. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. It would be different. There's no doubt about it. All those experiences growing up being a boxing fan help create what the UFC is today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting because humans have been fighting for millennia, and it seems like with the UFC, the rate of innovation is just insane. In these last three decades, it seems like we've discovered how to do unarmed combat faster and better than any time in human history.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree with you 100%. The first UFC happened in 1993. Martial art versus martial art. And now over the last 30 years, martial arts has evolved faster than... And like you just said, combat sports, fighting, whatever you want to call it, martial arts, it has evolved so much in 30 years more than the last 300 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did you think when you saw UFC 1 with Hoist?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>happening and it was fun and it was exciting and everything else. And then I fell off after that. The first one I watched, but I was too big of a boxing fan. Plus once grappling started taking over, and by grappling meaning the wrestling and the jiu-jitsu guys had just laid there, I completely lost interest. It's funny that I'm having this conversation with you right now because I was out last night with my friends and we were talking about, because one of my buddies who's a host here in town, just did jiu-jitsu for the first time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>...Yesterday. And he was like-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did he get his ass kicked?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>ground.\" It is such an eyeopening, mind blowing experience when you do it for the first time and then you become completely addicted to it. And we were training three, four days a week trying to kill each other, me and the Fertittas, and that's how we fell in love with the sport. I think that first time that you do jiu-jitsu, it's like the red pill and the blue pill in The Matrix. Do you want to believe that this is the world that you live in, or do you want to see what the real world looks like?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just is a real red pill.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It really is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You realize, \"Holy shit, all that shit talking I've been doing about me being a badass,\" you realize you're not. You get dominated by another human being, you realize, \"No.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the time because of the whatever, and we don't have a good relationship at all. But I'll tell you this, Frank Shamrock came in one day and Frank Shamrock had me in side control. The pressure that this guy put on my chest made me tap. It felt like there was a car on my chest. And with zero effort from him, it was absolutely effortless. And when you train with somebody that's at such a level when you're not, it is the most humbling, mind blowing experience you can have, especially as a man, but as a human being.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just for fun, do you remember what your go-to submission was?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so when we first started out and started doing it, I had a pretty good guillotine in the beginning. So I'd catch a lot of people in guillotines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're okay being on bottom? So the guard was pretty good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I was okay with the bottom. I was comfortable there. But you know what I never liked? I never liked gi. We started fucking around with a gi in the beginning, that's how we started. And then once I took the gi off, I felt like I had no submissions because I couldn't grab onto anything. So after that, I went all no gi and I never wanted to wear a gi.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating because no gi has become big now and there's a lot of interesting people. I got trained with Gordon Ryan, and the level there is just fascinating. It's become the science and it looks like fighting now. It looks more like fighting as opposed to with the gi, sometimes it doesn't quite look like fighting. And I feel like it's transferable to actual MMA fighting, no gi stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or street.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Street, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, if you start off in your first year you're in a gi, man, you better hope guy's got winter jackets on or something if something happens in the street because, I know all the jiu-jitsu fucking people are going to go crazy over this, but in my opinion, no gi is way better than gi.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, I also do judo. So in the street scenario, if you're comfortable on the feet and you can clinch and you can throw, because most of us wear clothing, especially in Boston in the winter setting, so if you're comfortable on the feet, you could still do well. The problem with jiu-jitsu is most people are not comfortable on the feet, the sports jiu-jitsu. Most people want to get to the ground as quickly as possible. So what'd you think of Hoist at that time in the early... Because it blew a lot of people's minds that there's more to this puzzle.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>100%, and the fact that you had these guys like Ken Shamrock that were jacked and you had all these wrestlers or the big massive guys that they had in the different weight classes, and this skinny little dude like Hoist was out there beating everybody. I mean, if you look at the way the Gracie's played that, you couldn't have had a better advertisement for Gracie Jiu-jitsu at the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also for MMA, because there's just a lot of surprising elements. A lot of people's prediction was wrong. They didn't think the skinny guy would win. And they're like, \"Oh shit, there's more to this.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What's the real beautiful thing about jiu-jitsu? It's like when you talk about if you wanted to get your daughter into a martial art, \"Should I put my daughter into karate or should I put her into this?\" You put your daughter into jiu-jitsu 100% because it's not about size or strength, it's about technique. And you give your daughter a bunch of jiu-jitsu and a little bit of Muay Thai.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, she becomes dangerous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's like the perfect combo. Because you can put your son into anything. Your son can get into some... Boys are going to learn how to fight and they're going to do whatever. But girls are different. And the other thing, I mean, this is the biggest selling point for jiu-jitsu for women. I mean, when a woman, no matter how big, how small can put a guy to sleep in three and a half seconds.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the origin story of the UFC as it is today as you've created it and you and Lorenzo and Fertitta brothers built it?<|eot_id|>"}

When we hung up the phone, I literally picked up the phone and called Lorenzo and I said, \"Hey, I just got off the phone with Bob Meyrowitz, the owner of the UFC, I think they're in trouble and I think we could buy it and I think we should. You should reach out to him.\" So Lorenzo called Meyrowitz, and I don't remember the timeline, but within the next two months, we ended up owning the UFC for $2 million bucks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you've said that you fought a lot of battles during that time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, the early days of building this company and building the sport, it was the wild, wild west, man. It was crazy back then. I was literally at war every day with all different types of people. Plus traditionally, there's bad people that are involved in fighting, man, there's lots of bad people. And we had to sift our way through that for the first seven, eight years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in general, there's corruption that people steal money. They're thinking just about themselves, not the bigger business.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let me tell you about this. I mean, I want to say it was the Netherlands. I don't remember exactly where. It could have been Amsterdam.

This guy would call me, text me, and threaten my life every day. I used to go, \"Fuck you,\" and this and that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said, \"Fuck you\" to that guy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, man. Especially back then. But I mean, this is the type of shit that went on in the early days. This guy who was one of the owners of Affliction was not a good human, let's put it that way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the business side of it?

Then he comes over and starts running DirecTV, who we always had a great relationship with and he's the reason we left DirecTV and said, \"Fuck it. We'll just go streaming then.\" I don't remember his name. I'd have to ask Lorenzo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in general, just in this whole space, there's a lot of shady people?<|eot_id|>"}

We're going to do this and clip it like this and do it like that.\" We're sitting in the venue that night, and I lean over to Lorenzo because the fight's coming up. I go, wait till you see this interview with Baroni. They didn't fucking do it. They didn't do it. These guys were guys that were freelance guys that worked for Showtime at the time or something like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 00:24:03].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>my fucking seat, went back there, kicked the fucking door of the truck open, and I said, \"You motherfuckers.

You know what me and the Fertittas knew about production when we bought this UFC? I want to say we had two or three weeks to pull off an event.

And then you build the team to come in and help execute.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of people that do fighting promotions fail. You succeeded against the long odds.

I sat through enough fucking budget meetings and... Horrible budget meetings. Horrible. We're losing millions of dollars a year, and I'm in these budget meetings. So I get to pick and choose what I do these days. Back in the early days, you don't get to pick and choose.

So I didn't know what tapes were these definitely we have to keep, or these we don't need. So I had to sit there and go through every single tape. And I popped in a tape and there was an interview on the Ivory Keenen Wayans show, the oldest Wayans brother, and he had a talk show at the time, and he had Joe Rogan, the guy from Fear Factor on the show, and he was promoting Fear Factor, but all he would talk about was UFC.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's Joe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>other places. So they drop you into these markets to do radio, and the fighters were horrible at it. Fighters getting up at 3:30 in the morning, especially leading up to a fight, never good. They sound like they're tired, they act like they're tired, and they definitely act like they don't want to be on there, and it's bad radio. What you can't have is bad radio. So the only two people that could pull off these radio tours were me and Joe Rogan.

He would tell you the setup, what was going to come next and everything. He'd just absolutely articulate it perfectly, brilliantly, and people at home started to understand. And the impact that Joe Rogan has had and continues to have on this sport is immeasurable. He's the biggest podcaster in the world, and he is on the UFC pay-per-views 14 times a year, and he's always talking about the sport. It's immeasurable what this guy has done for this company and the sport.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, still to this day, like I'll have dinner with him offline, he'll just talk fighting.

Joe was getting canceled for something, and they didn't want him commentating the fights, and you on the phone offered your resignation over this. I got teary-eyed over that. That's such a...

I can't say what's going to happen when I leave, but when I'm here, the people who are with me and have been with me, they know exactly what's up, and Joe knows what's up. And again, it's a two-way street. Joe Rogan has been very loyal to me, and I'm very loyal to Joe Rogan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Lorenzo, another guy you have close friendship with, you seem to have been extremely effective together as business partners.

And I'm a guy that goes like this, right? So we almost balance each other out. There's a lot of things that he's really fucking good at, and there's a lot of things that I'm really good at, and they're both on the opposite sides of the spectrum.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that level headed thing was useful when the UFC was losing money and it was unknown whether it's going to survive those low points?<|eot_id|>"}

When you think about the UFC and how big it is and how far it reaches and how many people it touches, the Fertittas Brothers made a $2 million investment, then put in another 44 million, and look at how many lives that investment has changed over the last 25 years. It's fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's also crazy. Just forget the business of it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And in this business, you might be an older fighter, but if you're still ranked in the top 10, there's young guys coming for you.

And everybody was saying, when we made that fight with Saint-Denis that Poirier was in big trouble, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. That's awesome. That helps build the entire thing that Poirier, and then Poirier goes out and does what he did that night. That's what makes fucking legends.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting because sometimes being the underdog is a really good thing for the long-term story of who you are as a fighter.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm actually very superstitious about that. I believe that what you put out, you get back. And I believe that when you have, you should take care of other people and you should always try to bring people up with you and all that kind of stuff. But the movie that changed the whole trajectory of my life was Vision Quest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah. Well, yeah. That's a good one too. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Vision Quest, man, I fucking love that movie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he wasn't at work. He took the night off. He shows up at the shitty little fucking apartment that the guy lives in and the guy's putting a suit and tie on and shit. He's like, \"They said you called in sick. What's going on?\" He's like, \"Well, yeah. Aren't you wrestling this guy tonight?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, but why would you? You're going to get docked a night's pay and all this other shit.\" He says, \"You know what, man?\" Then it all gets laid out. I get the goosebumps even telling you this fucking part of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that the Pele speech?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stadium goes crazy. And this guy runs around. And I'm sitting here in my fucking apartment alone and I start crying. Yeah. I start crying.\" The guy who's been shitting on him the whole fucking time actually really respects him for what he's done and sees what this kid is capable of doing and all this shit. This fucking movie spoke to me on so many different levels. And I think it's probably the most underrated movie of all time when you really break down the meaning of what this movie is about. And it really fucking spoke to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's probably the greatest movie on one-on-one combat...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ever made.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>messages that it's giving you in this movie, it's excellent. You know it's funny. They just did the... And I saw this after the fact, which completely fucking pissed me off. They did the 25 year or the 30-year thing. It was filmed in Spokane, Washington. They showed the movie at a movie theater there, and the cast members came out and spoke about it. I would've fucking flown there for that. Are you shitting me? I'd have been there in fucking 30 seconds to go up there and be a part of that. That movie literally changed my life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I suppose me too. It made me want to wrestle. I mean, probably the reason I was... Maybe it made me fall in love with wrestling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, you know what's funny? I wasn't even into wrestling at all, and I didn't have to be for that movie to...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's this basic human story.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's such a great movie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's what fighting does. It brings out the basic, the humanity of a person really, for the people that choose to step up and step in the ring. And then chase greatness and actually do it from against the long odds. That's why it's a beautiful game.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it's so true. I mean, when you think about, I'm 54 years old right now, like that. I mean, it just fucking flew by. And you think when you're young that you have all this time. You have no time. There's no time. I mean one of the quotes on the wall in the gym in there is, \"There is no tomorrow,\" from Rocky III. There is no tomorrow. Fuck that shit. Let's get all this shit done today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think about your death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, I'm not afraid of death. Not even a little bit. I'm not afraid of it. I don't know if that'll be the case when I'm facing it, when I'm looking down the barrel of it, laying in a hospital bed somewhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But for now, just squeezing as much as you can out of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>100%. I literally, I don't even like to sleep. My life is so fucking awesome, I don't even want to go to bed at night. I don't even want to go to sleep. I want to stay up fucking, I wish I could do fucking 24 hours and never have to sleep. That's how much I love my life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What has watching thousands of fights over the years taught you about human nature, about us humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>different emotions happen in people when fights break out. But one thing that is always the case, everybody's watching, man. Everybody's, fucking all of their eyes are on the fight. I mean, we were just in Mexico, fucking fight broke out in the good seats right here with these seats that are super expensive. And security never fucking came. They just let these guys fight until they gassed out. And then everybody put their chairs back together and snapped back down and fucking. I literally got up from my table, walked over, and was watching this fight at the fights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At the fights. I mean humans fight and humans love watching fighting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. And that was my thought process going into buying the UFC, and I believe that this would work everywhere. And thank God we were right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Dana, thank you for bringing this very human thing of fighting, the art of it, the science of it, the heroic stories, the vision quest stories of it all.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Boom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Really appreciate you talking today, brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you. Pleasure, buddy. Thank you for the kind words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dana White. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali. \"Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration, it's a dare.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
