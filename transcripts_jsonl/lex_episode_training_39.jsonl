So in the street scenario, if you're comfortable on the feet and you can clinch and you can throw, because most of us wear clothing, especially in Boston in the winter setting, so if you're comfortable on the feet, you could still do well. The problem with jiu-jitsu is most people are not comfortable on the feet, the sports jiu-jitsu. Most people want to get to the ground as quickly as possible.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>underrated movie of all time when you really break down the meaning of what this movie is about.

And now, let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali. \"Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact, it's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration, it's a dare.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
