{"text": "<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, Inside the Metaverse. Mark and I are hundreds of miles apart from each other in physical space, but it feels like we're in the same room because we appear to each other as photorealistic Kodak Avatars in 3D with spatial audio. This technology is incredible and I think it's the future of how human beings connect to each other in a deeply meaningful way on the internet. These avatars can capture many of the nuances of facial expressions that we humans use to communicate and motion to each other. Now, I just need to work on upgrading my emotion expressing capabilities of the underlying human. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. And now, dear friends, here's Mark Zuckerberg. This is so great. Lighting change? Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we can put the light anywhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it doesn't feel awkward to be really close to you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, it does. I actually moved you back a few feet before you got into the headset. You were right here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know if people can see this, but this is incredible. The realism here is just incredible. Where am I? Where are you, Mark? Where are we?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're in Austin, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No. I mean this place. We're shrouded by darkness with ultra realistic face, and it just feels like we're in the same room. This is really the most incredible thing I've ever seen. And sorry to be in your personal space. We have done jujitsu before.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was commenting to the team before that I feel like we've choked each other from further distances than it feels like we are right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is just really incredible. I don't know how to describe it with words. It really feels like we're in the same room.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It feels like the future. This is truly, truly incredible. I just wanted to take it in. I'm still getting used to it. It's you, it's really you, but you're not here with me. You're there wearing a headset and I'm wearing a headset. It's really, really incredible. Can you describe what it takes currently for us to appear so photo realistic to each other?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>photorealistic, it's also actually much more bandwidth efficient than transmitting a full video or especially a 3D immersive video of a whole scene like this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it captures everything. To me, the subtleties of the human face, even the flaws, that's all amazing. It makes it so much more immersive. It makes you realize that perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion. It's the little subtle flaws like freckles and variations in color and just...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Wrinkles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... all stuff about noses.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Asymmetry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, asymmetry, and just the corners of the eyes, what your eyes do when you smile, all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Eyes are a huge part of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just incredible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we're in two completely different states halfway across the country, and it looks like you're just sitting right in front of me. It's pretty wild.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I'm almost getting emotional. It feels like a totally fundamentally new experience. For me to have these kinds of conversations with loved ones, it would just change everything. Maybe just to elaborate, I went to Pittsburgh and went through the whole scanning procedure, which has so much incredible technology, software and hardware, going on, but it is a lengthy process. So what's your vision for the future of this in terms of making this more accessible to people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>applications and the use cases around it. But I don't know, I think it's going to be a pretty wild next few years around this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm actually almost at a loss for words. This is just so incredible. This is truly incredible. I hope that people watching this can get a glimpse of how incredible it is. It really feels like we're in the same room. I guess there's an uncanny valley that seems to have been crossed here. It looks like you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you said, I do think we're beyond the uncanny valley here where it does feel like you. It doesn't feel weird or anything like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's going to be the meme that the two most monotone people are in the Metaverse together, but I think that actually makes it more difficult. The amazing thing here is that the subtleties of the expression of the eyes, people say I'm monotone and emotionless, but I'm not. It's just maybe my expression of emotion is more subtle, usually, with the eyes. And that's one of the things I've noticed is just how expressive the subtle movement of the corners of the eyes are in terms of displaying happiness or boredom or all that stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>immersion when you're in it that, that doesn't quite translate to a 2D screen. But I don't know, I'm curious to see what people think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I'm curious to see if people could see that my heart is actually beating fast now. This is super interesting that such intimacy of conversation could be achieved remotely. I don't do remote podcasts for this reason, and this breaks all of that. This feels like just an incredible transition to something else, the different communication. It breaks all barriers, like geographic physical barriers. You mentioned, do you have a sense of timeline in terms of how many difficult things have to be solved to make this more accessible to like scanning with a smartphone?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it out and into more of the features. But, yeah, definitely in the next few years you'll be seeing a bunch more experiences like this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I would love to see some celebrities scanned and some non-celebrities and just more people to experience this. I would love to see that. My mind blown. I'm literally at a loss for words because it's very difficult to just convey how incredible this is, how I feel the emotion, how I feel the presence, how I feel the subtleties of the emotion in terms of work meetings or in terms of podcasts. This is awesome. I don't even need your arms or legs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we got to get that. That's its own challenge.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think that we do want to get all of that into here, and that'll be some of the work over the next period as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned Quest Three. That's coming out. I've gotten a chance to try that too. That's awesome. How'd you pull off the mix? So it's not just virtual reality, it's mixed reality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going to enjoy that too. So yeah, I'm really excited to see how people use it. But yeah, Quest 3 coming out later this fall.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I got to experience it with other people sitting around and there's a lot of furniture. And so you get to see that furniture, you get to see those people, and you get to see those people enjoy the ridiculousness of you swinging your arms. I mean, presumably their friends of yours, even if they make fun of you, there's a lot of love behind that and I got to experience that. So that's a really fundamentally different experience than just pure VR with zombies coming out of walls and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's like someone shooting at you and you hide behind your real couch in order to duck the fire. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's incredible how it's all integrated, but also subtle stuff, like in a room with no windows, you can add windows to it and you can look outside as the zombies run towards you, but it's still a nice view outside. And so that's pulled off by having cameras on the outside of the headset that do the pass through. That technology is incredible to do that on a small headset.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going with Quest Pro, but I think it'll really get accelerated once Quest 3 gets out there. So yeah, I'm pretty excited about this one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Plus there's hand tracking, so you don't need to have a control, so the cameras aren't just in the pass through of the entire physical reality around you. It's also tracking the details of your hands in order to use that for gesture recognition, this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>shorter period of time than I expected, so that's been pretty cool. I don't know, did you see the demo experience that we built around?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Piano?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the piano. Learning to play piano.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's incredible. You're basically playing piano on a table, and that's without any controller. And how well it matches physical reality with no latency, and it's tracking your hands with no latency and it's tracking all the people around you with no latency. Integrating physical reality and digital reality, obviously that connects exactly to this Codec Avatar, which is in parallel allows us to have ultra realistic copies of ourselves in this mixed reality. So it's all converging towards an incredible digital experience in the Metaverse. To me, obviously I love the intimacy of conversation, so even this is awesome, but do you have other ideas of what this unlocks, of something like Codec Avatar unlocks in terms of applications, in terms of things we're able to do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are going to be uses for both the expressive and the photorealistic over time. I just don't know what the balance is going to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's a really good, interesting philosophical question, but to me, in the short term, the photorealistic is amazing. To where I would prefer, you said the workroom, but on a beach with a beer, just to see a buddy of mine remotely on a chair next to me, drinking a beer. I mean that, as realistic as possible, is an incredible experience. So I don't want any fake hats on him. I don't want any, just chilling with a friend, drinking beer, looking at the ocean, while not being in the same place together. I mean, that experience is just, it's a fundamentally, it's just a high quality experience of friendship. Whatever we seek in friendship, it seems to be present there in the same kind of realism I'm seeing right now. This is totally a game changer. So to me, this is, I can see myself sticking with this for a long time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's like being able to pull this off, it's a pretty impressive and I think to some degree, it's just this kind of awesome experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But I'm already, sorry to interrupt, I'm already forgetting that you're not real. This really-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I am real. It's novel. This is just an avatar version of me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a deep philosophical question. Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are going to end up being a bunch of questions that come from that over time, that I think are going to be fascinating too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mean just the nature of identity of who we are? You know how people do summer beach body? Where people will be, for the scan, they'll try to lose some weight and look their best and sexiest with the nice hair and everything like that. It does raise the question of if a lot of people interacting with the digital version of ourselves, who are we really? Are we the entity driving the avatar or are we the avatar?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have to, and psychologists, really, there's going to be a lot to understand about how our perception of ourselves and others has shifted from this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, this might be a bit of a complicated and a dark question, but one of the first feelings I had experiencing this is I would love to talk to loved ones. And the next question I have is I would love to talk to people who are no longer here that are loved ones. So if you look into the future, is that something you think about? Who people who pass away, but they can still exist in the metaverse, you could still have, talk to your father, talk to your grandfather and grandmother and a mother once they pass away. The power of that experience is one of the first things my mind jumped because it's like, this is so real.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with in different ways. I think that that is also just going to be a very powerful set of capabilities that people have over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've made major strides in developing these early AI personalities with the idea where you can talk to them across the Meta apps and have interesting, unique kind of conversations. Can you describe your vision there and these early strides and what are some technical challenges there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>between two people or more, put them in a group chat, make the group chat more interesting around whatever your interests are, sports, fashion, trivia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Video games. I love the idea of playing. I think you mentioned Baldur's Gate, an incredible game. Just having an AI that you play together with. I mean, that seems like a small thing, but it could deeply enrich the gaming experience.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the AIs that we've built that just in our internal testing people have loved the most is an adventure text-based like a dungeon master.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of these folks and be the embodiment in the avatar of them. So Snoop Dogg is the dungeon master, which I think is just hilarious.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. In terms of the next steps of, you mentioned Snoop, to create a Snoop AI, so basically AI personality replica a copy... Or not a copy, maybe inspired by Snoop, what are some of the technical challenges of that? What does that experience look like for Snoop to be able to create that AI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with some small businesses. I think that that stuff we'll be ready to do this year. And we're rolling it out basically right after Connect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I'm deeply entertained by the possibility of me sitting down with myself and saying, \"Hey, man, you need to stop the dad jokes or whatever.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the idea of a podcast between you and AI assistant Lex podcast.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, there is just even the experience of an avatar, being able to freeze yourself like basically first mimic yourself, so everything you do, you get to see yourself do it. That's a surreal experience. That feels like if I was an ape looking in a mirror for the first time, realizing, \"Oh, that's you.\" But then freezing that and being able to look around like I'm looking at you, I don't know how to put it into words, but it just feels like a fundamentally new experience. I'm seeing maybe color for the first time. I'm experiencing a new way of seeing the world for the first time because it's physical reality, but it's digital. And realizing that that's possible, it's blowing my mind. It's just really exciting. I lived most of my life before the internet and experiencing the internet and experiencing voice communication, video communication. You think like, \"Well, there's a ceiling to this, but this is making me feel like there might not be, there might be that blend of physical reality and digital reality. That's actually what the future is.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a weird experience. It feels like the early days of a totally new way of living, and there's a lot of people that kind of complain, \"Well, the internet, that's not reality. You need to turn all that off and go in nature.\" But this feels like this will make those people happy. I feel like, because it feels real, the flaws in everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>kind of philosophical way that I would want the world to work in the future is a much more coherently, blended, physical and digital world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There might be some difficult philosophical and ethical questions we have to figure out as a society. Maybe you can comment on this. So the metaverse seems to enable, sort of unlock a lot of experiences that we don't have in the physical world. And the question is what is and isn't allowed in the metaverse? In video games, we allow all kinds of crazy stuff. And in physical reality, a lot of that is illegal. So where's that line? Where's that gray area between video game and physical reality? Do you have a sense of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going to take a while, so we're going to just get to see how it evolves and what developers and different folks do with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you could comment, this might be a bit of a very specific technical question, but Llama 2 is incredible. You've released it recently. There's already been a lot of exciting developments around it. What's your sense about its release and is there a Llama 3 in the future?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's ready too. But we're not close to doing that this month. I mean, that's a thing that we're still somewhat early and working on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, in general, thank you so much for open sourcing Llama 2 and for being transparent about all the exciting developments around AI. I feel like that's contributing to a really awesome conversation about where we go with AI. And obviously, it's really interesting to see all the same kind of technology integrated into these personalized AI systems with the AI personas, which I think when you put in people's hands and they get to have conversations with these AI personas, you get to see interesting failure cases where the things are dumb or they go into weird directions. And we get to learn as a society together what's too far, what's interesting, what's fun, how much personalization is good, how much generic is good. And we get to learn all of this. And you probably don't know this yourself. We have to all figure it out by using it, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>want to interact with historical figures? We made one of Jane Austin and one of Marcus Aurelius, and I'm curious to see how that goes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm excited for both. Aa a big fan I'm excited for both. I have conversations with them. And I am also excited to see, the internet, I don't know if you heard, can get kind of weird and I applaud them for it. So-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've heard that, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So it'd be nice to see how weird they take it, what kind of memes are generated from this. And I think all of it is, especially in these early stages of development as we progress towards AGI, it's good to learn by playing with those systems and interacting with them at a large scale like you said.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>different apps and they'll have profiles and we'll be able to engage people on Instagram and Facebook, I think it's going to be really fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, we're talking about AI, but I'm still blown away this entire time that I'm talking to Mark Zuckerberg. And you're not here, but you feel like you're here. I've done quite a few intimate conversations with people alone in a room, and this feels like that. So I keep forgetting for long stretches of time that we're not in the same room. And for me to imagine a future where I can with a snap of a finger do that with anyone in my life, the way we can just call right now and have this kind of shallow 2D experience, to have this experience like we're sitting next to each other is like... I don't think we can even imagine how that changes things where you can immediately have intimate one-on-one conversations with anyone. In a way, we might not even predict change civilization.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think this is going to be by far the most human and social computing platform that has ever existed. And that's what makes me excited.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think just to linger on this kind of changing nature of reality of what is real, maybe shifting it towards the sort of consciousness. So what is real is the subjective experience of a thing that makes it feel real versus necessarily being in the same physical space, because It feels like we're in the same physical space. And that the conscious experience of it, that's probably what is real. Not like that the space time, the physics of it. You're basically breaking physics and focusing on the consciousness. That's what's real. Just whatever's going on inside my head.<|eot_id|>"}

Thanks to you and thanks to the amazing Meta teams that I've met, the engineers and just everybody I've met here. Thank you for helping to build this future.
