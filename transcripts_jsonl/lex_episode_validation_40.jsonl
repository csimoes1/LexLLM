In addition to the Launch on Warning concept, there's this other insane concept called Sole Presidential Authority. And you might think, in a democracy that's impossible, right? You can't just start a war. Well, you can just start a nuclear war if you are the commander in chief, the President of the United States. In fact, you're the only one who can do that. We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear Armageddon. No matter how nuclear war starts, it ends with everyone dead.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Annie Jacobsen, an investigative journalist, Pulitzer price finalist and author of several amazing books on war, weapons, government secrecy, and national security, including the books titled Area 51, Operation Paperclip, The Pentagon's Brain, Phenomena, Surprise, Kill, Vanish, and her new book, Nuclear War.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm coming back at you with a very dark answer and a very big number. And that number is 5 billion people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You go second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour what would happen if the nuclear war started? There's a lot of angles from which I would love to talk to you about this. First, how would the deaths happen in the short term and the long term?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>insane. First millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions of people will die in the first 72 minutes of a nuclear war. And then, comes nuclear winter where the billions happen from starvation. And so, the shock power of all of this is meant for each and every one of us to say, \"Wait, what?\" This actually exists behind the veil of national security. Most people do not think about nuclear war on a daily basis, and yet hundreds of thousands of people in the nuclear command and control are at the ready in the event it happens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it doesn't take too many people to start one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the words of Richard Garwin, who was the nuclear weapons engineer who drew the plans for the Ivy Mike thermonuclear bomb, the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in 1952. Garwin shared with me his opinion that all it takes is one nihilistic madman with a nuclear arsenal to start a nuclear war. And that's how I begin the scenario.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the different ways it could start? Literally, who presses a button and what does it take to press a button?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fraction of a second. And so, there begins this horrifying policy called Launch on Warning, right? And that's the US counterattack. Meaning the reason that the United States is so ferociously watching for a nuclear launch somewhere around the globe is so that the nuclear command and control system in the US can move into action to immediately make a counterstrike. Because we have that policy, Launch on Warning, which is exactly like it says. It means the United States will not wait to absorb a nuclear attack. It will launch nuclear weapons in response before the bomb actually hits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the president, as part of the Launch on Warning policy, has six minutes... I guess can't launch for six minutes, but at six minute mark from that first warning, the president can launch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Congress. So, built into that is this extraordinary speed you talk about, the six-minute window. And some people say, \"That's ridiculous. How do we know that six minute window?\" Well, here's the best hitting the nail on the head statement I can give you, which is in President Reagan's memoirs, he refers to the six-minute window and he says... He calls it irrational, which it is. He says, \"How can anyone make a decision to launch nuclear weapons based on a blip on a radar scope.\" His words. \"To unleash Armageddon.\" And yet, that is the reality behind nuclear war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just imagine sitting there, one person, because a president is a human being, sitting there, just got the warning that Russia launched. You have six minutes. I meditate on my immortality every day. And here, you would be sitting and meditating, contemplating not just your own mortality, but the mortality of all the people you know, loved ones. Just imagining. What would be going through my head is all the people I know and love personally, and knowing that there'll be no more, most likely. And if they somehow survive, they will be suffering and will eventually die. I guess the question that kept coming up is how do we stop this? Is it inevitable that it's going to be escalated to a full-on nuclear war that destroys everything? And it seems like it will be. It's inevitable. In the position of the President, it's almost inevitable that they have to respond.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>into office, I have learned, understanding the idea of deterrence, this idea that we have these massive arsenals of nuclear weapons pointed at one another ready to launch so that we never have nuclear war. But what we're talking about now is, what if we did? What if we did? And what you've raised is this really spooky, eerie subtext of the world right now because many of the nuclear armed nations are in direct conflict with other nations. And for the first time in decades, nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths of leaders. This is shocking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So deterrence, the polite, implied assumption is that nobody will launch. And if they did, we would launch back and everybody would be dead. But that assumption falls apart completely, the whole philosophy of it falls apart once the first launch happens, then you have six minutes to decide, \"Wait a minute. Are we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth? Or do we turn the other cheek in the most horrific way possible?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>launch because it would assure everyone's destruction. Yes. But what if someone did? And in my interviews with scores of top tier national security advisors, people who advise the president, people who are responsible for these decisions if they had to be made, every single one of them said it could happen. They didn't say this would never happen. And so, the idea is worth thinking about because I believe that it pulls back the veil on a fundamental security that if someone were to use a tactical nuclear weapon, \"Well, it's just an escalation.\" It's far more than that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you, the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, maybe you can draw the line between a tactical and a strategic nuclear weapon. That could be a catalyst. That's a very difficult thing to walk back from.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>God. Almost certainly. And again, every person in the national security environment will agree with that, certainly on the American side. Strategic weapons, those are big weapons systems. America has a nuclear triad. We have our ICBMs, which are the silo-based missiles that have a nuclear warhead in the nose cone, and they can get from one continent to the other in roughly 30 minutes. Then we have our bombers, B-52s and B-2s, that are nuclear capable. Those take travel time to get to another continent. Those can also be recalled. The ICBMs cannot be recalled or redirected once launched.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That one is a particularly terrifying one. So land launched missiles, rockets with a warhead, can't be recalled.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how little the presidents generally know, as we were talking a moment ago, President Reagan, in 1983, gave a press conference where he misstated that submarine launched ballistic missiles could be recalled. They cannot be recalled. Here's the guy in charge of the arsenal if it has to get let loose, and he doesn't even know that they cannot be recalled. So, this is the kind of misinformation and disinformation. UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, recently said when he was talking about the conflicts rising around the world, he said, \"We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear Armageddon.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, just to linger on the previous point of tactical nukes. You were describing strategic nukes, land launched bombers, submarine launched. What are tactical nukes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>decision on the battlefield in an operational environment to use a tactical nuclear weapon. You're just upping the ante. But the problem is that all treaties are based on this idea of no nuclear use, right? You cannot cross that line. And so, what would happen if the line is crossed is so devastating to even consider. I think that the conversation is well worth having among everyone that is in a power of position. As the UN Secretary General said, \"This is madness.\" Right? \"This is madness. We must come back from the brink. We are at the brink.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we talk about some other numbers? You mentioned the number of warheads. Land launched, how long does it take to travel across the ocean from the United States to Russia, from Russia to the United States, from China to the United States, approximately how long?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the math, 33 minutes from a launch pad in Pyongyang to the East coast of the United States. You get the idea, it's about 30 minutes. But hopefully now that allows readers to suddenly see all this as a real... You almost see it as poetry, as terrible as that may sound. You can visualize it and suddenly it makes sense. And I think the sense-making part of it is really what I'm after in this book. Because I want people to understand, on the one hand, it's incredibly simple, it's just the people that have made it so complicated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's one of those things that can change all of world history in a matter of minutes. We just don't, as a human civilization, have experience with that. But it doesn't mean it'll never happen. It can happen just like that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>75 years, and we have managed to stay alive. One of the reasons why so many of the sources in the book agreed to talk to me, people who had not previously gone on the record about all of this, was because they are now approaching the end of their lives. They spent their lives dedicated to preventing nuclear World War III. And they'll be the first people to tell you we're closer to this as a reality than ever before. And so, the only bright side of any of this is that the answer lies most definitely in communication.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, there's a million other questions here. I think the details are fascinating and important to understand. So one, you also say nuclear submarines... You mentioned about 30 minutes, 26, 33 minutes. But with nuclear submarines, that number can be much, much lower. So, how long does it take for a warhead missile to reach the east coast of the United States from a submarine?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>grapefruit-sized object in space than a submarine under the sea. These things are like hell machines, and they're moving around throughout the oceans, ours, Russia's, China's, maybe North Korea's constantly. And we now know they're sneaking up to the east and west coast of the United States within a couple hundred miles. How do we know that? Why do we know that? Well, I found a document inside of a budget that the defense department was going to Congress for more money recently and showed maps of precisely where these submarines... How close they were getting to the eastern seaboard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wat, wait, wait. So, nuclear subs are getting within 200 miles?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Couple hundred miles, yes. They weren't precise on the number, but when you look at the map-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Couple hundred.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And that's when you're talking about under 10 minutes from launch to strike.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Undetectable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the fact because of a lot of underwater surveillance systems that we have. But in real time, you cannot find a nuclear submarine. And just the way a submarine launches goes 150 feet below the surface to launch its ballistic missile. I mean, it comes out of the missile tube with enough thrust that the thrusters, the boot, they ignite outside the water and then they move into boost. And so, the technology involved is just stunning and shocking. And again, trillions of dollars spent so that we never have a nuclear war. But my God, what if we did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As you write, they're called the handmaidens of the apocalypse. What a terrifying label. I mean, one of the things you also write about, so for the land launched ones, they're presumably underground. So the silos, how long does it take to go from pressing the button to them emerging from underground for launch? And is that part detectable or it's only the heat?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. He orders the launch, and they launch 60 seconds later. And then, they take 30 some odd minutes to get to where they're going. The submarines take about 14 or 15 minutes from the launch command to actually launching. And that has to do, I surmise, with the location of the submarine, its depth. Some of these things are so highly classified and other details are shockingly available if you look deep enough, or if you ask enough questions, and you can go from one document to the next, to the next and really find these answers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to ask top secret questions, but to what degree do you think the Russians know the locations of the silos in the US and vice versa?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Lex, you and I can find the location of every silo right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, no.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all footnoted where you can learn more about how these systems have changed over time. And why, more than anything, it's very difficult to get out of this catch-22 conundrum that we need nuclear weapons to keep us safe. That is the real enigma. Because the other guys have them, right? And the other guys have- The other guys have them. And the other guys have more sinister ways of using them, or at least that's what the nomenclature out of the Pentagon will always be when anyone tries to say, \"We just need to really think about full disarmament.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've written about intelligence agencies.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>treaties, the different signatories to the treaty all report these numbers. And of course, the different intelligence community, people are keeping track of what's being revealed honestly and reported with transparency and what is being hidden. The real issue is the new systems that Russia is working on right now, and that will lead us... We are moving into an era whereby the threat of actually having new weapon systems that are nuclear capable is very real because of the escalating tensions around the world. And that's where the CIA would guess is doing most of its work right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So most of your research is looking at the older versions of the system, and presumably there's potentially secret development of new ones, hopefully not-<|eot_id|>"}

Call me over- informed or naive, one or the other. That would be my position because DARPA works from the chicken or the egg scenario. That once you learn about something, once you learn Russia's created this Typhoon submarine, which may or may not be viable, it's too late if you don't already have one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We'll probably talk about DARPA a little bit. One of the things that makes me sad about Lockheed, many things make me sad about Lockheed, but one of the things is because it's very top secret, you can't show off all the incredible engineering going on there. The other thing that's more philosophical, DARPA also, is that war seems to stimulate most of our, not most, but a large percent of our exciting innovation in engineering. But that's also the pragmatic fact of life on earth is that the risk of annihilation is a great motivator for innovation, for engineering, and so on. But yes, I would not discount the United States in its ability to build the weapons of the future, nuclear included. Again, terrifying.

For me anyways, you realize what goes into every single one of these decisions. You realize the massive system of systems behind every item you might just see in passing and glancing on the news as you see the mil aide carrying that satchel. Well, what's in that satchel?

You have to get the blue impact clock ticking.\" He needs to look at this list to decide what targets to strike and what weapon systems to use. And that is what is on, according to Buzz Patterson, a piece of laminated plastic. He described it like a Denny's menu. And from that menu, the president chooses targets and chooses weapon systems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's probably super old school, like all top secret systems are, because they have to be tested over and over and over and over and over, probably-<|eot_id|>"}

The STRATCOM commander will receive word from the president, \"Launch orders.\" And then directs the 150,000 people beneath him what to do from the bunker beneath STRATCOM. He gets the orders, then he has to run out of the building and jump onto what's called the doomsday plane. We'll get into that in a minute. Let me just finish the...

In the STRATCOM bunker, in addition to the nuclear strike advisor who can answer very specific questions, if the president's like, \"Wait a minute, why are we striking that and not that?\" There's also a weather officer.

He's in that plane, he's flying around the United States, and he's making decisions because the Pentagon's been taken out. At 9/11, by the way, Bush was in the doomsday plane.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And Bush had to make decisions quickly, but not as quickly as he would've needed to have done if there's a nuclear launch.<|eot_id|>"}

People have these fantasies that we have a system like the Iron Dome.

Are we sure about this?\" People really don't want to believe this is an actual fact. After 9/11, Congress considered putting Aegis missiles and maybe even THAAD systems along the West Coast of the United States to specifically deal with the threats against nuclear-armed North Korea. But it hasn't done so yet. And again, you have to ask yourself, \"Wait a minute. This is insanity.\" One nuclear weapon gets by any of these systems, and it's full-out nuclear warfare. So that's not the solution. More nuclear weapons is not the solution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm looking for a hopeful thing here about North Korea.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interceptor missiles try to shoot down the warhead. The capability is not like what's called shoot and look.

So in my scenario, we fire off four, which is about what I was told, one to four, because you're worried about the next one that's going to come in.

How likely are mistakes, accidents, false alarms taken as real, all this kind of stuff in this picture? So we've assumed the detection works correctly. How likely is it possible, anywhere?

And so this nuclear launch showed up at that bunker beneath the Pentagon and at the bunker beneath STRATCOM because they're connected, as being real. And then it was like, oh, whoops. It's actually a simulation test tape.

He was saber-rattling with North Korea during COVID, and he said, \"They need to know if they launch one nuclear weapon, we launch one. If they launch two, we launch two.\" But it's actually more than that. They launch one, we launch 80. That's called escalate to deescalate. Pound the you know what out of them to get them to stop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But to make a case for that, there is a reason to the madness because you want to threaten this gigantic response.

And absolutely back in the 1950s the generals and the admirals that were running the nuclear command and control system believed that we could fight and win a nuclear war despite hundreds of millions of people dying. This was the prevailing thought. And only over time did the kind of concept come into play that no, we can never have a nuclear war. It's the famous Gorbachev and Reagan joint statement. \"A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\" But before that, many people believed that it could be won, and they were preparing for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not to be political and not to be ageist, but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of stuff come into play here?

They've all said to me with great pride, \"We prevented World War III, nuclear World War III.\" But that idea that the commander in chief and everyone within the national security apparatus should be making really good decisions about war. It's the oldest cliche in the world that the wars are fought by the young kids. It's not a cliche; it's true. And so the character part about the president should be in play whether we're thinking about nuclear war or any war, in my opinion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I agree with you first of all, but it feels like with nuclear war, one person becomes exponentially more important. With regular war, the decision to go to war or not, advisors start mattering more. There's judgment issues. You could start to make arguments for more leeway in terms of what kind of people we elect. It seems like with nuclear war, there's no leeway. It's like one person can resist the jamming the president force, the warmongers all the calculation in considering what are the errors, the mistakes, the missiles flying over Russia, the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world, consider all of humanity, the history of humanity, the future of humanity, all of it just loaded in to make a decision. Then it becomes much more important that your cognitive abilities are strong and your judgment abilities against powerful wise people just as a human being are strong.

And this issue came up, would you defy presidential orders? So the caveat I would say to McDuff's answer of easier to win the Powerball is that if the commander of STRATCOM interpreted the president's behavior to be unreliable, to be non-presidential, then dot dot dot. But now you're into some really radical territory.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, fundamentally, it feels like just looking at all the presidents of the United States in my lifetime, it feels like none of them are qualified for this six minutes.

I mean everybody, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden. If I was a commander of STRATCOM, I'd be like, \"What does this guy know about any of this?\" I would defy orders. I mean, in this situation, when the future of human civilization hangs in the balance, to be the person that says, \"Yes, launch,\" no matter what, I just can't see a human being on earth being able to do that in the United States of America. That's a hell of a decision. Like, this is it. That's it.<|eot_id|>"}

What does that mean? Why are people in America not more involved? As citizens do we have a responsibility for that?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to look up, that there's more there. It's like the big version of the wishing tree, what do I wish for for myself? What is maybe, perhaps, the realignment of thinking for those of us in search of happiness instead of war. What does it mean to have a conscience, to have consciousness? What does it mean to be a thinking person? What does it mean to be on this earth, to be born, to live, to die? And then, there is legacy. And so, all of those ideas are, I think, foster the kind of conversation that de-escalates conflict.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In some deep way, the mysteries of what's out there when we look out to the stars are the same mysteries that we find when trying to understand the human mind and they're coupled in some way. For me, thinking about alien civilizations out there is really the same kind of question, which is, what are we? What is this? What are we doing here? How do we come here? Why does it seem to be so magical and beautiful and powerful? Now, where's it going? Because it feels like we're really, perhaps for the first time in history, are in a moment where we can destroy ourselves. And so, naturally you ask, well, where's others like us? Perhaps, are we inevitably going to a place where we'll destroy ourselves? Is it basically inevitable that we destroy ourselves? We become too powerful and insufficiently wise to know what to do with that power? But like you said, probably the answers to that are in here. We don't need to look out there. I'd love to ask you about the extrasensory perception. You've written, like you said, the book Phenomena on the secret history of the US government's investigations into extrasensory perception and psychokinesis. What are some of the more interesting extrasensory abilities that were explored by the government, and maybe just in general, ESP. What is it? What do you know of it?<|eot_id|>"}

And then that led to another espionage platform called the A-12 Oxcart, which is anyone who's seen the X-Men movies knows about the SR-71. And that's a two-seater, right? And before that, there was the A-12 Oxcart, and that was the CIA's stealth Mach 3 spy plane. Think about that in the early 1960s. It's astonishing.

No, but I come from it from that lane of thinking, and there are so many strategic deception campaigns, and as I look over the decades of how these same UFO stories, and again, this is just my opinion based on my reporting, this narrative that keeps reoccurring, it seems to me like a very large catch- all to keep the public's attention on that, not on that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you, sexy stories like UFOs are going to be leveraged by the CIA for strategic deception.<|eot_id|>"}

So look that up, and then you go, \"Oh my God.\" And to my eye, you can apply any of these other names substitute in Paul Bennewitz or any of the current individuals who really become convinced of X, Y, or Z, when in fact there's a strategic deception campaign going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of incentive for the CIA and other intelligence agencies to get you to look the other way on whatever is happening.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But then you have the Thomas theorem, that becomes applicable there too. If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences. So this idea of UFOs and we're being lied to, it becomes real to many people. And then that creates a whole subset of problems to the point where things are spiraling out of control and there is no center anymore. So a lot of people that are briefed on programs maybe aren't even aware of their position within a greater campaign, or I'm wrong, and there are aliens among us.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I appreciate the possibility of acknowledging that you might be wrong.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the counter to that is this, which is, this is a very strong argument for why this is a big strategic deception campaign. Think about the Defense Department and the air... Think about how jealously they guard its airspace. I mean, you had a Chinese balloon flying over and the whole world went crazy. It was front page news. So the fact that one element, or a couple people in the defense department have made this statement, we've lost control of our airspace over this alleged UFO craft that they can't explain. I don't buy that at all. Zero.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But of course it's possible that it is alien spacecraft if it is that.

But what he said to me is the most interesting thing, which is that it's not a military problem, it's an intelligence problem. Because Jacques believes that this is some kind of intelligence, which really the closest I can do to wrapping my head around that takes me to consciousness, the idea of what is consciousness. And I think that's where it becomes very interesting. I think the government is hiding bodies and crafts is very Paul Bennewitz, read it, Google it, look into it, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think this kind of flying saucer thing is a trivialization of what kind of, if there's alien civilizations out there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Trivialization. That's a great word. Trivialization, I agree with you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I tend to believe that there's a very large number of alien civilizations out there, and I believe we would have trouble comprehending what that even looks like were they to visit. I tend to believe they are already here or have visited, and we're too dumb to understand what that even means. And they certainly would not appear as flying objects that defy gravity for brief moments of time on a low resolution video. I tend to have humility about all this kind of stuff, but I think radical humility is required to even open your eyes to what an alien intelligence would actually look like. And to me, it's beyond military applications. It's like the basic human question of what is even this thing, like you mentioned consciousness that's going on. Where's this come from? Why is this so powerful? Is it unique in the universe? I tend to believe not. Of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks like Elon who believe we are alone, but I think that belief, just like you said, has power because it actually manifests itself in reality. So if you believe that we're alone in this universe, that's a great motivator to build rockets and become multi-planetary and save ourselves, especially in the case of nuclear war, because otherwise, whatever this special sauce, this flame of consciousness will go out if we destroy ourselves on this earth. And for people like Elon, it's too high of a probability that we destroy ourselves on earth not to try to become multi-planetary. In your book on Area 51, you propose an explanation that I think some people have criticized at the very end that this might've been a disinformation campaign from, I guess Stalin, that the Roswell incident was a remotely piloted plane with a quote, \"grotesque child-sized aviator\". Just looking back at all that now, years later, what's the probability that it's true? What's the probability it's not?<|eot_id|>"}

I was at his house, met all his kids, grandkids.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We should say the source is the main expert advisor behind the story that it was...

Well, it feels appropriate now, first of all, because you and I have been talking for several hours. So this is what is truly a long-form conversation, and it's the outcome of a very long time of my reporting and also being judicious about closing the loop on that because I do think it's important for people to know that sources have revelations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And like you said, the programs both on the Soviet side and the American side, conflicting, I think is the term we used previously, ethically, morally, on all fronts. People have done some horrible things in the name of security. In your book, Surprise, Kill, Vanish, you write about the CIA and the so-called president's third option. So first of all, first option being diplomacy and second option being war. So when diplomacy is inadequate and war is a terrible idea, we go to the third option. And this third option is about covert action, and it's about assassination. So how much of that does the CIA do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is open to debate. We know from the historical record that the CIA was heavily involved in assassination during the Cold War.

It operates under what's called Title 50. And it's interesting to me as reporter, because before I wrote the book and reported openly about Title 50, it was not really discussed. And now you even see operators themselves on podcasts talking about Title 50, which is kind of great because it's like the cat's out of the bag, guys. That's what it's called. And that's how it works. It means what we say goes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you elaborate on what Title 50 is?

So you can see how these all entwine and you become more and more informed, and you go, \"Aha.\" Right? So that's how Title 50 worked. So the night of that mission, it was a CIA mission because the CIA is allowed to go into Pakistan and kill someone, and the military can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating.

I mean, SOG missions, they called it suicide on the ground, because that's what it was. And these guys had no identifiable. Nothing. I mean, they were essentially in pajamas.

I imagine with Mossad, maybe this now the leadership of Hamas or the military branch of Hamas is much wanted from an assassination perspective.

They just want the job done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, speaking of Mossad, in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the different intelligence agencies out there? CIA and Mossad, MI6, SVR and FSB and Chinese intelligence, all this stuff. Is there some interesting differences, insights that you have from all of your studying FCIA?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a really interesting question. I don't know. And here's why. It's because I've never interviewed any intelligence officer with those other agencies. I've interviewed a couple of people with Shin Bet in Israel. But until I speak to an actual source whose job it was, I don't know. So the information that I'm getting is based on perception of others which one would think would be deeply clouded by the idea that America is the greatest. We're better than them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. Well, actually the fascinating thing is because you've spoken to a lot of people about the CIA. How do you know they're telling the truth? And this actually probably applies generally to your interviews with very secretive people. How do you get past the bullshit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>given. And then in all of my books, whether there are three or 400 pages, there's always 100 pages of notes at the end. So you can see all the sourcing and you can begin to get an understanding of how journalism in the national security world works. And also great opportunity for me to say, I'm often standing on the shoulders of journalists before me who did an incredible job digging into something and being able to report what they knew. Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old, and so much more has come to light since.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I also would just like to say that I appreciate that you said, \"Great question, I don't know.\" Not enough people say I don't know and that's a sign of a great journalist. But speaking about things you might not know about, let me ask you about something going on currently. So recently Alexei Navalny died in prison, perhaps was killed in prison. What's your sense from looking at it? Do you think he died of natural causes in prison? Do you think it's possible he was assassinated? Russia, Ukraine, Mossad, CIA, whoever has interest in this particular war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>involved. But Russian assassins were able to poison Khokhlov with polonium. What happens to him is insane and it's a miracle he didn't die, but he doesn't. And then he defects to the West and he writes these books and he tells lots of incredible secrets about the Russian assassination programs and their poison labs and they're really interesting. So to answer that question, I mean to my eye of course, I don't know, but it certainly looks like Russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted, taking care of dissidents that go against Mother Russia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in the style of KGB assassinations. Is there something you can comment on about the ways that KGB operates versus the CIA when we look at the history of the two organizations, the Cold War, after World War II and the leading up to today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about these programs of America working to maintain assemblance of democratic ideals, however surprising that may be. In other words, always trying to, I don't want to say fight fair because killing people isn't fair, but versus a certain ruthlessness, a real sinister totalitarian type ruthlessness certainly from Soviet Russia. I'm far less familiar with modern day Russian assassination activities, although we certainly know on the record that they exist. Some people have done great reporting on that. But there seems to be almost a sadism about the Russian programs that I personally have not seen in the American programs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about on the surveillance side? It seems like America's pretty good at mass surveillance, or at least has been revealed through NSA and all this reporting and leaks and whistleblowers. Can you comment to the degree to how much surveillance is done by the US government internally and externally?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you'd asked me five years ago, I would've a very different answer. Because first of all, they're looking for a needle in the haystack. They're looking for the Bin Laden and they can't find the needle in the haystack, but they continue to create the haystack and survey the haystack. I'm I right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back toward me.\" Which I did. And he just didn't even hold up his phone. He just looked at his hand and his phone was on me. And he went back down and it was like the tiniest movement. And when I came back to him, he went like this and he showed me, there I was. Everything about me. Facts and figures and all images. And he knew who I was before I even got to him. So is that a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, we could have another three hour conversation about that alone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're saying more and more, you don't need NSA where we're giving over the data ourselves publicly or semi publicly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thinks about this issue because he believes, just like you stated, that what we are turning over about ourselves actually exceeds anything that ARGUS-IS could do from above because we're doing it willfully. So what it's doing is it's creating an ability for, if someone wants to know about you, if someone, let's say in government, wants to know about Lex Fridman, they can find out everything about you. And then that gets used for tagging, tracking and ultimately. In the war theater it was called find, fix, finish. Well, what do you think the finish is in that statement?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not pleasant.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's called a drone strike. Find, find him with the biometric, fix him, meaning fix his position. We know he's moving in a car. That's him. Finish him. Call it in, drone strike. Boom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we could return to nuclear war, you've briefly mentioned that a lot of things go back to the Third Reich and Hitler. If we go back to World War II, we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the dropping of the two bombs. I would love to get your opinion on whether we should or shouldn't have done that. And also to get your opinion on what would've happened if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first. Do you think it was possible he could have built the bomb first?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In my researching Third Reich weapons for Operation Paperclip, because of course we got a lot of those scientists, after.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which is another great book in a terrifyingly complicated operation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>best interview and most meaningful perhaps that I ever did was with Alfred O'Donnell, who was a participant in the Battle of Okinawa, which was like this insane. Just to read stories about Okinawa, it makes your hair stand on end. And O'Donnell like so many others, was slated to invade mainland Japan, to his almost certain death. So somebody like that, it makes sense right from the get go why he would be pro nuclear weapons. It saved his own personal life and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with. And it ended the war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it sent a signal? Like without that we wouldn't have known perhaps about the power of the weapons. So in the long arc of that history, 70 years plus, it is the reason why deterrence has worked so far.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>everybody always wants more. It's a very dangerous... It's like more power, literally, just more power. And what is more confounding to me beyond the fact that we dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war ended is that this decision was then made to develop the thermonuclear bomb. A force that is such... The degree of magnitude of that power is mind-boggling. I mean even projects within the Manhattan Project defined thermonuclear weapon, the thermonuclear weapon as the evil thing. It was evil. It's a weapon of genocide. Atomic weapons destroy cities, thermonuclear weapons destroy civilizations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You open the book with a Churchill quote, \" The story of the human race is war. Except for brief and precarious interludes there has never been peace in the world. And before history began, murders strife was universal and unending.\" Do you think there will always be war? Do you think that there is some deep human way in which we're tending to this global war eternally?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>far as we have to be able to build the tools that we have. So the hopeful answer is we will evolve beyond this brute force, kill the other guy attitude. Certainly these are questions that will become more obvious over time. I just want to play my little part in this world that I live in as the storyteller who brings information to people so that they can have these questions with themselves, with their friends, with their families. And I think in asking that very question, what you're really saying is, why don't we evolve beyond war fighting?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is very possible. And your book is such a stark and powerful reminder that human civilization, as we know it ends in this century. It's a good motivator to get our shit together.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But aren't you really saying human civilization could end, not it ends?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could end.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Could end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the power of our weapons is growing rapidly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As they say, it's time to come back from the brink. And it's time to have that discussion while we're still talking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's another complexity sneaking up into the picture in the form of artificial intelligence and in cyber war, but also in hot war, the use of autonomous weapons. All of it starts becoming super complicated as we delegate some of these decisions about war, including nuclear war to more and more autonomy and artificial intelligence systems, is going to be a very interesting century. Do you just zoom out a little bit, hope that we become a multi-planetary species?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm all for adventure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I too while am for adventure, I'm all for backups in all forms. So I hope that human start a civilization on Mars and beyond out in space. And if you zoom on across all of it, what gives you hope about human civilization, about this whole thing we have going on here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, I am a fundamentally optimistic person. I must have come out of the shoot that way. Because I just am. Even though I write about really grim things, I get inspired by them because I do always believe in evolution. I also have the greatest family ever. Two kids, Jet and Finley, shout out to them. They're Lex Fridman fans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, oh you guys.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on what you know and believing in the next generation. And again, that's a sentiment echoed by all these cold warriors I've been talking to because they also share that idea that, wow, look at what we have done as a civilization and look where we're going. Whether it's exoplanetary travel or AI. It's just that the human factor of the desire to fight, the desire to have conflict, needs to be reconfigured, because with all these new technologies that we have, the peril is growing at an accelerating pace, perhaps faster than the average human can keep up with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well Annie, thank you for being a wonderful example of a great journalist, a great writer, a great human being.
