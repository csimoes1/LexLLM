{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>opinion that all it takes is one nihilistic madman with a nuclear arsenal to start a nuclear war. And that's how I begin the scenario.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the different ways it could start? Literally, who presses a button and what does it take to press a button?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It means the United States will not wait to absorb a nuclear attack. It will launch nuclear weapons in response before the bomb actually hits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the president, as part of the Launch on Warning policy, has six minutes... I guess can't launch for six minutes, but at six minute mark from that first warning, the president can launch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>launch nuclear weapons based on a blip on a radar scope.\" His words. \"To unleash Armageddon.\" And yet, that is the reality behind nuclear war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just imagine sitting there, one person, because a president is a human being, sitting there, just got the warning that Russia launched. You have six minutes. I meditate on my immortality every day. And here, you would be sitting and meditating, contemplating not just your own mortality, but the mortality of all the people you know, loved ones. Just imagining. What would be going through my head is all the people I know and love personally, and knowing that there'll be no more, most likely. And if they somehow survive, they will be suffering and will eventually die. I guess the question that kept coming up is how do we stop this? Is it inevitable that it's going to be escalated to a full-on nuclear war that destroys everything? And it seems like it will be. It's inevitable. In the position of the President, it's almost inevitable that they have to respond.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>conflict with other nations. And for the first time in decades, nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths of leaders. This is shocking.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So deterrence, the polite, implied assumption is that nobody will launch. And if they did, we would launch back and everybody would be dead. But that assumption falls apart completely, the whole philosophy of it falls apart once the first launch happens, then you have six minutes to decide, \"Wait a minute. Are we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth? Or do we turn the other cheek in the most horrific way possible?\"<|eot_id|>"}

I think the details are fascinating and important to understand. So one, you also say nuclear submarines... You mentioned about 30 minutes, 26, 33 minutes.

One of the things that makes me sad about Lockheed, many things make me sad about Lockheed, but one of the things is because it's very top secret, you can't show off all the incredible engineering going on there. The other thing that's more philosophical, DARPA also, is that war seems to stimulate most of our, not most, but a large percent of our exciting innovation in engineering. But that's also the pragmatic fact of life on earth is that the risk of annihilation is a great motivator for innovation, for engineering, and so on. But yes, I would not discount the United States in its ability to build the weapons of the future, nuclear included. Again, terrifying.

With regular war, the decision to go to war or not, advisors start mattering more. There's judgment issues. You could start to make arguments for more leeway in terms of what kind of people we elect. It seems like with nuclear war, there's no leeway. It's like one person can resist the jamming the president force, the warmongers all the calculation in considering what are the errors, the mistakes, the missiles flying over Russia, the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world, consider all of humanity, the history of humanity, the future of humanity, all of it just loaded in to make a decision. Then it becomes much more important that your cognitive abilities are strong and your judgment abilities against powerful wise people just as a human being are strong.

Maybe even, as you touch on, the very fact of nuclear war might be forgotten. The lessons of nuclear war might be forgotten.

For me, thinking about alien civilizations out there is really the same kind of question, which is, what are we? What is this? What are we doing here? How do we come here? Why does it seem to be so magical and beautiful and powerful? Now, where's it going? Because it feels like we're really, perhaps for the first time in history, are in a moment where we can destroy ourselves. And so, naturally you ask, well, where's others like us? Perhaps, are we inevitably going to a place where we'll destroy ourselves? Is it basically inevitable that we destroy ourselves? We become too powerful and insufficiently wise to know what to do with that power? But like you said, probably the answers to that are in here. We don't need to look out there. I'd love to ask you about the extrasensory perception. You've written, like you said, the book Phenomena on the secret history of the US government's investigations into extrasensory perception and psychokinesis.

Trivialization, I agree with you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I tend to believe that there's a very large number of alien civilizations out there, and I believe we would have trouble comprehending what that even looks like were they to visit. I tend to believe they are already here or have visited, and we're too dumb to understand what that even means. And they certainly would not appear as flying objects that defy gravity for brief moments of time on a low resolution video. I tend to have humility about all this kind of stuff, but I think radical humility is required to even open your eyes to what an alien intelligence would actually look like. And to me, it's beyond military applications. It's like the basic human question of what is even this thing, like you mentioned consciousness that's going on. Where's this come from? Why is this so powerful? Is it unique in the universe? I tend to believe not. Of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks like Elon who believe we are alone, but I think that belief, just like you said, has power because it actually manifests itself in reality. So if you believe that we're alone in this universe, that's a great motivator to build rockets and become multi-planetary and save ourselves, especially in the case of nuclear war, because otherwise, whatever this special sauce, this flame of consciousness will go out if we destroy ourselves on this earth. And for people like Elon, it's too high of a probability that we destroy ourselves on earth not to try to become multi-planetary. In your book on Area 51, you propose an explanation that I think some people have criticized at the very end that this might've been a disinformation campaign from, I guess Stalin, that the Roswell incident was a remotely piloted plane with a quote, \"grotesque child-sized aviator\".

So to me as an outside observer, it seems like it's more difficult than you would imagine. But perhaps that's the intelligence aspect of it, not the actual assassination of locating the person.<|eot_id|>"}

They just want the job done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, speaking of Mossad, in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the different intelligence agencies out there? CIA and Mossad, MI6, SVR and FSB and Chinese intelligence, all this stuff. Is there some interesting differences, insights that you have from all of your studying FCIA?<|eot_id|>"}

We're better than them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. Well, actually the fascinating thing is because you've spoken to a lot of people about the CIA. How do you know they're telling the truth? And this actually probably applies generally to your interviews with very secretive people. How do you get past the bullshit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>being able to report what they knew. Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old, and so much more has come to light since.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I also would just like to say that I appreciate that you said, \"Great question, I don't know.\" Not enough people say I don't know and that's a sign of a great journalist. But speaking about things you might not know about, let me ask you about something going on currently. So recently Alexei Navalny died in prison, perhaps was killed in prison. What's your sense from looking at it? Do you think he died of natural causes in prison? Do you think it's possible he was assassinated? Russia, Ukraine, Mossad, CIA, whoever has interest in this particular war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it certainly looks like Russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted, taking care of dissidents that go against Mother Russia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in the style of KGB assassinations. Is there something you can comment on about the ways that KGB operates versus the CIA when we look at the history of the two organizations, the Cold War, after World War II and the leading up to today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>reporting on that. But there seems to be almost a sadism about the Russian programs that I personally have not seen in the American programs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about on the surveillance side? It seems like America's pretty good at mass surveillance, or at least has been revealed through NSA and all this reporting and leaks and whistleblowers. Can you comment to the degree to how much surveillance is done by the US government internally and externally?<|eot_id|>"}

Boom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we could return to nuclear war, you've briefly mentioned that a lot of things go back to the Third Reich and Hitler. If we go back to World War II, we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the dropping of the two bombs. I would love to get your opinion on whether we should or shouldn't have done that. And also to get your opinion on what would've happened if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first. Do you think it was possible he could have built the bomb first?<|eot_id|>"}

Except for brief and precarious interludes there has never been peace in the world. And before history began, murders strife was universal and unending.\" Do you think there will always be war?

All of it starts becoming super complicated as we delegate some of these decisions about war, including nuclear war to more and more autonomy and artificial intelligence systems, is going to be a very interesting century.
