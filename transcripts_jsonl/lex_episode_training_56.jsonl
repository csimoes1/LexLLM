He's a chemist from University of Glasgow who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant and fun to talk to scientists I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin. So your big assembly theory paper was published in Nature. Congratulations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It created, I think it's fair to say, a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting discussion. So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Go for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it. And also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies of the object there are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. That's spot on. Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Spot on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Spot on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was not expecting that. Okay, so let's go through definitions. So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is an object?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>suppose, mathematically. But yeah, I still wake up some days and go to think to myself, what is an object? Because it's a non-trivial question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Persists over time, I'm quoting from the paper here. An object is finite, is distinguishable. I'm sure that's a weird adjective, distinguishable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We've had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out. You wouldn't believe it's so funny.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Persists over time. And is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable, such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The history is in the objects. It's kind of cool, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So what defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm happy with both depending on the day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so the set of steps it took to create the object. So there's a sense in which every object in the universe has a history. And that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity. How complicated it is. Okay, what is an assembly index?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because we could measure it. So almost before this paper came out, we'd published papers, explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so that's not so trivial to figure out. So when you look at an object, we could say a molecule, we could say object more generally. To figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object, that doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to build up mathematical architectures in the same way. And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path with molecules, with language, with mathematical theorems? It seems like once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego world is, figuring out how to get there from the basic building blocks, is that an empty hard problem? It's a hard problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>news is there are shortcuts. And we might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating it, which is kind of insane.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, how would you do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same or tending towards the same assembly index from molecule that we can calculate mathematically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec. You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum. And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how generalizable is that shortcut, first of all it's chemistry. And second of all, beyond that, that seems like a nice hack and you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry. So you can say, okay, it kind of correlates. But the whole idea behind assembly theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger. It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is then the definition of the object? How many pixels? How do you break it down? And so we're just learning all this right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you compute, begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical, a set of pixels on a 2D plane that form a thing?<|eot_id|>"}

But first of all, not every pixels, I mean this is at the core, machine learning and computer vision, not every pixels that important. And there's macro features, there's micro features and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The eyes appear in a lot of them, the smile appears in a lot of them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>four universes, the assembly universe, the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just combinatorial kind of explosion in everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the biggest one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the biggest one.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes. Assembly possible, laws of physics come in this case in chemistry, bonds assembly.

So when you say the universe has to construct the system that does the work, is that like the environment that allows for selection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the thing that does the selection.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed, constrained in some way. So it's not kind of just making everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but Lee, what's the factory that made the factory? First of all, you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence at the beginning. Those are constraints. But what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the minimal amount of information required to propagate that motif in time and space. And it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things that can construct themselves in the shortest path.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest, in the most efficient way. Big leap I just took there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be efficient. And this is still very hand wavy and maybe having no leg to stand on, but we think we're getting somewhere with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's probably some parallelization, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is not sequential. The building is, I guess.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially. You can work in parallel, you can get your friends together and they can...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it could be a factory, but I think we're going way beyond molecules and my competence so probably should go back to molecules, but hey.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, before we get too far, let's talk about the assembly equation. Okay. How should we do this? Let me just even read that part of the paper. We define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary to produce an ensemble of observed objects quantified using equation one. The equation basically has A on one side, which is the assembly of the ensemble, and then a sum from one to N, where N is the total number of unique objects. And then there is a few variables in there that include the assembly index, the copy number which we'll talk about. That's an interesting, I don't remember you talking about that. That's an interesting addition and I think a powerful one. It has to do with what, that you can create pretty complex objects randomly, and in order to know that they're not random, that there's a factory involved, you need to see a bunch of them. That's the intuition there. It's an interesting intuition and then some normalization. What else is and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sure that more than one object, one object could be a one-off and random. And then you have more than one identical object. That's interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When there's two of a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Two of a thing is super important, especially if the index assembly index is high.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we could say several questions here. One, let's talk about selection. What is this term selection? What is this term evolution that we're referring to? Which aspect of Darwinian evolution are we referring to? That's interesting here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>second. The paper, what it did is it kind of annoyed, we didn't know it. It got intention and obviously the angry people were annoyed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's angry people in the world. That's good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>grumpy because there's not enough chemistry in there. Then finally, when the creationist said it wasn't creationist enough, I was like, \"I've done my job.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the physics, they say, because you're basically saying that physics is not enough to tell the story of how biology emerges?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then they said a few physics is the beginning and the end of the story.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The first two sentences caused everybody-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics.<|eot_id|>"}

These laws underpin life's origin, evolution, and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Wow. First of all, we should say the title of the paper, this paper was accepted and published in Nature. The title is Assembly Theory Explains and Quantifies Selection and Evolution, very humble title.

Which, you can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit AI systems give, the more control we give to those AI systems over our power grid, over our nuclear weapons, or weapons of any sort.

It just needs to be smart in a set of specific ways. And the more capable the AI systems become, the more you could see us giving them control over, like I said, our power grid, a lot of aspects of human life.

One, I think there is a role in society for people that say we're all going to die. Because I think it filters through as a message, as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern. Meaning it's not 95%, but when you say 95% and it filters through society, it'll give an average of like a 0.03%. An average. So, it's nice to have people that are like, \"We're all going to die,\" and then we'll have a proper concern. For example, I do believe we're not properly concerned about the threat of nuclear weapons currently. It just seems like people have forgotten that that's a thing, and there's a war in Ukraine with a nuclear power involved. There's nuclear powers throughout the world, and it just feels like war in the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that I don't think people are properly calibrating in their head. We're all thinking it's a Twitter battle as opposed to actual threat. So, it's nice to have that kind of level of concern. But to me, when I hear AI doomers, what I'm imagining is with unintended consequences a potential situation where let's say 5% of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made, of unintended consequences. I don't want to imagine the entirety of human civilization dying, but there could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly.<|eot_id|>"}
