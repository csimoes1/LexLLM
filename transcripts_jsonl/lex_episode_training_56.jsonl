He's a chemist from University of Glasgow who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant and fun to talk to scientists I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It created, I think it's fair to say, a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting discussion. So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Go for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it. And also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking at how many copies of the object there are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. That's spot on. Yep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Spot on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Spot on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was not expecting that. Okay, so let's go through definitions. So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is an object?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, an object. So if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and they need to be decomposable into sub-units. All human made artifacts are objects. Is a planet an object? Probably yes, if you scale out. So an object is finite and accountable and decomposable, I suppose, mathematically. But yeah, I still wake up some days and go to think to myself, what is an object? Because it's a non-trivial question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Persists over time, I'm quoting from the paper here. An object is finite, is distinguishable. I'm sure that's a weird adjective, distinguishable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We've had so many people help offering to rewrite the paper after it came out.

And is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable, such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The history is in the objects. It's kind of cool, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So what defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm happy with both depending on the day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so the set of steps it took to create the object. So there's a sense in which every object in the universe has a history. And that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity. How complicated it is. Okay, what is an assembly index?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny 'cause I was just like, \"No, this is sacrosanct. I don't know why, it'll come to me one day.\" And then when I was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct physical explanation, which I can get to, but it's the minimum and it's really important. It's the minimum. And the reason I knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it. So almost before this paper came out, we'd published papers, explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so that's not so trivial to figure out. So when you look at an object, we could say a molecule, we could say object more generally. To figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object, that doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you, you,\" connect and do the least amount of work. So it's really like the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object. And so for molecules, it came relatively intuitively. And then we started to apply it to language. We've even started to apply it to mathematical theorems. But I'm so well out of my depth. But it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up mathematical architectures in the same way. And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path with molecules, with language, with mathematical theorems? It seems like once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego world is, figuring out how to get there from the basic building blocks, is that an empty hard problem? It's a hard problem.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them in order and then that's how it works. And you keep looking for symmetry or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down. And that becomes [inaudible 00:07:53] quite hard. For some natural product molecules, it becomes very hard. It's not impossible, but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment. But as the object gets bigger it becomes really hard. But that's the bad news. But the good news is there are shortcuts. And we might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating it, which is kind of insane.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, how would you do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And my intuition, after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec, that was the first go at this. We did it with using infrared. And the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly index. And we used another technique as well in addition to infrared called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule. And that also worked out. So we have three techniques which each of them independently gives us the same or tending towards the same assembly index from molecule that we can calculate mathematically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec. You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum. And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how generalizable is that shortcut, first of all it's chemistry. And second of all, beyond that, that seems like a nice hack and you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry. So you can say, okay, it kind of correlates. But the whole idea behind assembly theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger. It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.<|eot_id|>"}

So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge. So you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path, by reproducing the pixels to make the image you want, you can measure that. So then you start to be able to take spatial data. Now there's some problems there. What is then the definition of the object? How many pixels? How do you break it down? And so we're just learning all this right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you compute, begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical, a set of pixels on a 2D plane that form a thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you would first of all determine the resolution. So then what is your XY and what the number on the X and Y plane and then look at the surface area. And then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution. And then we would basically then do exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the bonds. You'd cut bits out of the emoji and look at, you'd have a bag of pixels and you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, wait a minute. But first of all, not every pixels, I mean this is at the core, machine learning and computer vision, not every pixels that important. And there's macro features, there's micro features and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>science, we're wandering a bit here, but it's kind of worth wandering I think, you assume you have instantaneous access to all the information in the memory. In assembly theory you say, \"No, you don't get access to that memory until you've done the work.\" And then when you've done access to that memory, you can have access but not to the next one. And this is how in assembly theory, we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe, the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed. And they're all scales in this commentorial universe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Can you explain each one of them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yep. So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just combinatorial kind of explosion in everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the biggest one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the biggest one. It's massive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed. And the Y axis is assembly steps in time and the X axis as the thing expands through time, more and more unique objects appear.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes. Assembly possible, laws of physics come in this case in chemistry, bonds assembly. So that means-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those are extra constraints, I guess?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's really, the really interesting shift where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent. That is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous access to all those memories. You have to have done the work. Somehow the universe has to have somehow built a system that allows you to select that path rather than other paths. And then the final thing the assembly observed is basically us saying, \"Oh, these are the things we actually see. We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait a minute. So when you say the universe has to construct the system that does the work, is that like the environment that allows for selection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's the thing that does the selection.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You could think about in terms of a Von Neumann constructor versus a selection, a ribosome, a Tesla plant assembling Teslas. The difference between the assembly universe in Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says, \"No, Teslas are just easy. They just spring out, you know how to make them all. The Tesla factory, you have to put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're talking about the factory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. This is really nice, super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's some magic, it's not that. It's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory or something else that is making that object. I'm not saying there's some kind of woo-woo memory in the universe, morphic resonance or something. I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed, constrained in some way. So it's not kind of just making everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but Lee, what's the factory that made the factory? First of all, you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence at the beginning. Those are constraints. But what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a finite set of atoms. Now, let's say another molecule, smart ass molecule we'll call it, comes in and can survive in that environment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps. The molecule that only needs five steps continued, both molecules are being destroyed, but they're creating themselves faster they can be destroyed. You can see that the shortest path reigns supreme. So the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information required to propagate that motif in time and space. And it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things that can construct themselves in the shortest path.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest, in the most efficient way. Big leap I just took there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>space. And it's not now, it's a compromise between not just making A and B in the shortest path. You want to be able to make A and B in the shortest path, which might mean that A is slightly longer, compromise. So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction, when you take a given object, that can look longer. But that's because the overall function is the object is still trying to be efficient. And this is still very hand wavy and maybe having no leg to stand on, but we think we're getting somewhere with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's probably some parallelization, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is not sequential. The building is, I guess.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially. You can work in parallel, you can get your friends together and they can...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the cost function has been minimized. And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity, the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path. But the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule now. It's in the actual existence of the object over time. And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory, but I think we're going way beyond molecules and my competence so probably should go back to molecules, but hey.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, before we get too far, let's talk about the assembly equation. Okay. How should we do this? Let me just even read that part of the paper. We define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary to produce an ensemble of observed objects quantified using equation one. The equation basically has A on one side, which is the assembly of the ensemble, and then a sum from one to N, where N is the total number of unique objects. And then there is a few variables in there that include the assembly index, the copy number which we'll talk about. That's an interesting, I don't remember you talking about that. That's an interesting addition and I think a powerful one. It has to do with what, that you can create pretty complex objects randomly, and in order to know that they're not random, that there's a factory involved, you need to see a bunch of them. That's the intuition there. It's an interesting intuition and then some normalization. What else is and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>N minus one, just to make sure that more than one object, one object could be a one-off and random. And then you have more than one identical object. That's interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When there's two of a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Two of a thing is super important, especially if the index assembly index is high.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we could say several questions here. One, let's talk about selection. What is this term selection? What is this term evolution that we're referring to? Which aspect of Darwinian evolution are we referring to? That's interesting here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so this is probably what the paper, we should talk about the paper for a second. The paper, what it did is it kind of annoyed, we didn't know it. It got intention and obviously the angry people were annoyed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's angry people in the world. That's good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what happened is the evolutionary biologists got angry. We were not expecting that. We thought evolutionary biologists would be cool. I knew that some, not many, computational complexity people will get angry because I've kind of been poking them and maybe I deserved it, but I was trying to poke them in a productive way. And then the physicists kind of got grumpy because the initial conditions tell everything. The prebiotic chemist got slightly grumpy because there's not enough chemistry in there. Then finally, when the creationist said it wasn't creationist enough, I was like, \"I've done my job.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the physics, they say, because you're basically saying that physics is not enough to tell the story of how biology emerges?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then they said a few physics is the beginning and the end of the story.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what happened is the reason why people put the phone down on the call of the paper, if you view reading the paper like a phone call, they got to the abstract and in the abstract-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First sentence is pretty strong.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The first two sentences caused everybody-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>True, right? There's nothing wrong with that statement. Totally true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution, and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Wow. First of all, we should say the title of the paper, this paper was accepted and published in Nature. The title is Assembly Theory Explains and Quantifies Selection and Evolution, very humble title. And the entirety of the paper, I think, presents interesting ideas, but reaches high.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I am not... I would do it all again. This paper was actually on the pre-print server for over a year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You regret nothing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think, yeah, I don't regret anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You and Frank Sinatra did it your way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>universe. The universe is good, we explain all of it, look at us.\" And even biologists say, \"We can explain biology.\" And the poor chemists in the middle going, \"But hang on.\" And this paper kind of says, \"Hey, there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology. And that's at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds. And hey, let's look at this close and see if we can quantify it.\" So yeah, I never expected the paper to get that much interest. And still, it's only been published just over a month ago now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So just to link on the selection, what is the broader sense of what selection means?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in biology, selection and evolution is robust that you have error correction built in. You have really, there's good ways of basically making sure propagation goes on. So really the difference between inorganic, antibiotic selection and evolution and evolution and stuff in biology is robustness the ability to propagate, the ability to survive in lots of different environments. Whereas our poor little inorganic sole molecule, whatever, just dies in lots of different environments. So there's something super special that happens from the inorganic molecule in the environment that kills it to where you've got evolution and cells can survive everywhere.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How special is that? How do you know those kinds of evolution factors aren't everywhere in the universe?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>E. coli factories run out of food and stopped. And so that, looking at that... So in the initial box, although the amount of assembly was really small, it was able to replicate and use all the food and go up. And that's what we're trying to do in the lab, actually, is make those experiments and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that are producing complexity, as we feed in raw materials and we feed a challenge, an environment. We try and kill the molecules. And really, that's the main idea for the entire paper.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and see if you can measure the changes in the assembly index throughout the whole system.<|eot_id|>"}

But we can say, \"Look, if you don't like the cutoff on earth, go up higher, 30, 100, because there's going to be a point where you can find a molecule with so many different parts, the chances of you getting a molecule that has a hundred different parts and finding a million identical copies, that's just impossible. That could never happen in an infinite set of universes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you just linger on this copy number thing?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that was so interesting. I always understood the copy number is really important, but I never explained it properly, for ages.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>take, say, two molecules, molecules can be in different vibrational rotational states. They're moving all the time. So in this respect, identical molecules have identical bonding. In this case, we don't even talk about chirality, because we don't have a chirality detector. So two identical molecules in one conception, assembly theory, basically considers both hands as being the same. But, of course, they're not, they're different. As soon as you have a chiral distinguisher to detect the left and the right hand, they become different. And so, it's to do with the detection system that you have and the resolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I wonder if there's an art and science to the, which detection system is used when you show up to a new planet.<|eot_id|>"}

We have standardized detection systems of how to compare molecules.

Now, if the assembly index of them is really low and they're all indistinguishable, then they're telling you that you have to go to another resolution. So that would be, it is a sliding scale.

So they could just be falling apart. So you want to sniff a little bit of complexity and say warmer, warmer, warmer. Oh, we've found life, we found the alien.

The volatiles would then be put into the mass... into electrostatic trap, and you'd weigh the molecules and fragment them. Alternatively, you'd shine infrared light on them and you count number of bands. But you'd have to, in that case, do some separation, because you want to separate... And so, in mass spec, it's really nice and convenient, because you can separate electrostatically, but you need to have that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you do it in real time?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>before. A lot of the arguments we got, some people said, \"Oh, it's rubbish. Oh, by the way, I had this idea 20 years before.\" I was like, \" Which one?\" Is it the rubbish part or the really revolutionary part. So this kind of plucked two strings at once. It plucked the there is something interesting that biology are, we can see around this, but we haven't quantified yet. And what this is, is the first stab at quantifying that, so the fact that people said \"This is obvious.\" But if it's obvious, why have you not done it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. But there's a few things to say there. One is, this is in part of philosophical framework because it's not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe. It's very chemistry focused.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, well, I think you will be able to, we just haven't got there robustly. So if we can say how can we... Let's go up a level. So if we go up from level, let's go up from molecules to cells because you would jump to people and I jump to emoticons and both are good and they will be assembly...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Lets stick with cells, yeah. Good point.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>develop, you go all the way back, those cells undergo differentiation on a causal way that's biomechanically a feedback between the genetics and biomechanics. I think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types. We can even apply it to different cell disease types. So that's what we're doing next. But we are trying to walk... The thing is, I'm trying to, I want a leap ahead to go, whoa, we apply it to culture. Clearly you can apply it to memes and culture. And we've also applied to assembly theory to CA's and not as you think...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Cellular automaton, by the way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So in a cell, well, in a multicellular creature, you need to look back in time. So there is the initial cell, which the creature is fertilized and then starts to grow and then there is cell differentiation. And you have to then make that causal chain both on those. So that requires development of the organism in time. Or if you look at the cell surfaces and the cell types, they've got different features on the cell walls and inside the cell. So we're building up, but obviously I want a leap to things like emoticons, language, mathematical theorems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that's a very large number of steps to get from a molecule to the human brain.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mean the assembly index of a human brain, what does that even mean? Well, maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain, say all human brains have these number of features in common. If they have those number... And then let's look at a brain in a whale or a dolphin or a chimpanzee or a bird and say, \"Okay, let's look at the assembly indices and number of features in these.\" And now the copy number is just the number of how many birds are there, how many chimpanzees are there, how many humans are there?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then you have to discover for that the features that you would be looking for.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and that means you need to have some idea of the anatomy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But is there an automated way to discover features?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I guess so. And I think this is a good way to apply machine learning and image recognition just to basically characterize things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To apply compression to it, to see what emerges, and then use the features used as part of the compression, as the measurement of... As the thing that is searched for when you're measuring assembly index and copy number.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>universe, which is you have to go from assembly possible to assembly contingent and that jump from... Because assembly possible all possible brains, all possible features all the time. But we know that on the tree of life and also on the lineage of life, going back to Luca, the human brain just didn't spring into existence yesterday, it's a long lineage of brains going all the way back. And so if we could do assembly theory to understand the development, not just in evolutionary history, but in biological development, as you grow, we are going to learn something more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What would be amazing is if you can use assembly theory, this framework to show the increase in the assembly index associated with, I don't know, cultures or pieces of text like language or images and so on and illustrate without knowing the data ahead of time, just kind like you did with NASA that you were able to demonstrate that it applies in those other contexts. I mean, and that probably wouldn't at first, and you have to evolve the theory somehow. You have to change it, you have to expand it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess this is as a paper, a first step in saying, okay, \"Can we create a general framework for measuring complexity of objects. For measuring life, the complexity of living organisms.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's what this is reaching for.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>comment I want to make is that assembly theory is great for understanding when evolution has been used. The next jump is when we go to technology, because of course, if you take the M3 processor... I want to buy, I haven't bought one yet. I can't justify it, but I want it at some point. The M3 processor arguably is there's quite a lot of features, a quite large number. The M2 came before it, then the M1 all the way back, you can apply assembly theory to microprocessor architecture. It doesn't take a huge leap to see that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm a Linux guy, by the way. So your examples go way over my head.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, well, whatever...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that a fruit company of some sort? I don't even know. Yeah, there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask about language. Like you could look at... How would that work? You could look at GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, 3, 5, 4, and try to analyze the kind of language it produces. I mean, that's almost trying to look at assembly index of intelligence systems.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean I think the thing about large language models, and this is a whole hobbyhorse I have at the moment, is that obviously they're all about... The evidence of evolution in the large language model comes from all the people that produced all the language. And that's really interesting. And all the corrections in the Mechanical Turk, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. But that's part of the history, part of the memory of the system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to basically use an assembly based approach to making language in a hierarchy. My guess is that we might be able to build a new type of large language model that uses assembly theory, that it has more understanding of the past and how things were created. Basically the thing with LLMs is like, everything everywhere, all at once, splat and make the user happy. So there's not much intelligence in the model. The model is how the human interacts with the model. But wouldn't it be great if we could understand how to embed more intelligence in the system?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you mean by intelligence there? You seem to associate intelligence with history or memory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think selection produces intelligence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're almost implying that selection is intelligence. No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Kind of, I would go out in limb and say that, but I think it's a little bit more, human beings have the ability to abstract and they can break beyond selection. And this is... Darwinian selection, because a human being doesn't have to basically do trial and error, but they can think about it and say, \"Oh, that's a bad idea, won't do that.\" And then technologies and so on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we escaped Darwinian evolution and now we're onto some other kind of evolution, I guess? Higher level.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And assembly theory will measure that as well, right? Because it's all a lineage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Another piece of criticism or by way of question is how is assembly theory or maybe assembly index different from Kolmogorov complexity? So for people who don't know, a Kolmogorov complexity of an object is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the object as output.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there seems to be a disconnect between the computational approach. So Kolmogorov measure requires a Turing machine, requires a computer, and that's one thing. And the other thing is assembly theory is supposed to trace the process by which life evolution emerged, right? There's a main thing there. There are lots of other layers. So Kolmogorov complexity, you can approximate Kolmogorov complexity, but it's not really telling you very much about the actual... It's really telling you about your dataset, compression of your dataset.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>theory. I think that we're going to show that AIT is a very important subset of assembly theory because here's what happens. I think that assembly theory allows us to go understand when were selections occurring. Selection produces factories and things, factories in the end produce computers, and then algorithmic information theory comes out of that. The frustration I've had with looking at life through this kind of information theory is it doesn't take into account causation. So the main difference between assembly theory and all these complexity measures is there's no causal chain. And I think that's the main...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the causal chain is at the core of assembly theory.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And if you've got all your data in a computer memory, all the data's the same. You can access it in the same way. You don't care. You just compress it. And you either look at the program runtime or the shortest program. And that for me is absolutely not capturing what it is. What selection does.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But assembly theory looks at objects. It doesn't have information about the object history. It's going to try to infer that history by looking for the shortest history, right? The object doesn't have a Wikipedia page that goes with it about its history.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so what assembly theory allows you to do is without considering any other circumstances, to say from this object, how deep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself without any other constraints? And that's super powerful because the shortest path then allows you to say, \"Oh, this object wasn't just created randomly. There was a process.\" And so assembly theory is not meant to one up AIT or to ignore the factory. It's just to say, \"Hey, there was a factory and how big was that factory? And how deep in time is it?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's still computationally very difficult to compute that history, right? For complex objects?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is. It becomes harder. But one of the thing that's super nice is that it constrains your initial conditions, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>use that to constrain your drug discovery process. You flip the problem 180 and focus on the molecule evolution rather than the protein. And so you can guess in the future what might happen. So you rather than having to consider all possible molecules, you know where to focus. And that's the same thing if you're looking at in assembly spaces for an object where you don't know the entire history, but you know that in the history of this object, it's not going to have some other motif there that it doesn't apply. It doesn't appear in the past.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But just even for the drug discovery point you made, don't you have to simulate all of chemistry to figure out how to come up with constraints?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the molecules and the...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know enough about protein.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, this is another thing that I think causes... Because this paper goes across so many boundaries. So chemists have looked at this and said, \"This is not correct reaction.\" It's like, no, it's a graph.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure, there's assembly index and shortest path examples here on chemistry.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and what you do is you look at the minimal constraints on that graph. Of course it has some mapping to the synthesis, but actually you don't have to know all of chemistry. You can build up the constraints space rather nicely. But this is just at the beginning, right? There are so many directions this could go in and as I said, it could all be wrong, but hopefully it's less wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the little criticism I saw of... By way of question, do you consider the different probabilities of each reaction in the chain so that there could be different... When you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object, doesn't it matter that some parts in the chain are less likely than others?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It doesn't matter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no. Well, let's go back. So no, not less likely, but react... So, no. So let's go back to what we're looking at here. So the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that object probabilistically. So imagine you have all your atoms in a plasma, you've got enough energy, there's collisions. What is the quickest way you could zip out that molecule with no reaction constraints?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you define quickest there then?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's just basically walk on a random graph. So we make an assumption that basically the timescale for forming the bonds. So no, I don't want to say that because then it's going to have people getting obsessing about this point. And your criticism is a really good one. What we're trying to say is this puts a lower bound on something. Of course, some reactions are less possible than others, but actually I don't think chemical reactions exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, boy. What does that mean? Why don't chemical reactions exist?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the molecule. It falls apart too quickly because the bonds just form. But you can solve that with looking at infrared. So when people think about the probability, they're kind of misunderstanding. Assembly theory says nothing about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and their constraints are put in by biology. There was no chemist on the origin of life unless you believe in the chemist in the sky... And it's like Santa Claus, they had a lot of work to do, but chemical reactions do not exist and the constraints that allow chemical transformations to occur do exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, okay. So it's constraint. So there's no chemical reactions. It's all constraint application, which enables the emergence of... What's a different word for chemical reaction?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, like a function. It's a function, but no, but I love chemical reactions as a shorthand. And so the chemists don't all go mad. I mean, of course chemical reactions exist on earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a shorthand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a shorthand for these constraints.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So assuming all these constraints that we've been using for so long that we just assume that that's what was the case in natural language conversation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. The grammar of chemistry of course emerges in reactions and we can use them reliably, but I do not think the Wittig reaction is accessible on Venus.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, and this is useful to remember to frame it as constraint application is useful for when you zoom out to the bigger picture of the universe and looking at the chemistry of the universe and then starting to apply assembly theory. That's interesting. That's really interesting. But we've also pissed off the chemists now.<|eot_id|>"}

This paper, it feels like the person that went to the party and offended everyone simultaneously. So stop fighting with themselves and just focused on this paper.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe just a little insider interesting information.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the pre-print, there's just equations everywhere, like 23 equations.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>rejected?\" Because the first assembly paper on the mass spec we sent to Nature went through six rounds of review and rejected. And by a chemist that just said, \"I don't believe you. You must be committing fraud.\" And long story, probably a boring story, but in this case it went out to review, the comments came back and the comments were incredibly, they were very deep comments from all the reviewers. But the nice thing was the reviewers were kind of very critical, but not dismissive. They were like, \"Oh, really?

You've published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics within chemistry and beyond. Some of them have some little spice in them, a little spice of crazy like Tom Waits, says, \"I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.\" It's not a mundane paper.

And we're like, \"But look at the data. The data says...\" And they said, \"No, no. We don't believe you.\" And we went and I just wouldn't give up. And the editor in the end was just like... Different editors actually. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's behind that never giving up? When you're sitting there 10 o'clock in the evening, there's a melancholy feeling that comes over you and you're like, \"Okay, this is rejection number five.\" Or it's not rejection, but maybe it feels like a rejection because the comments are that you totally don't get it.

So I took the exams and passed them, fortunately. I didn't get the top grades, but I got into A Levels. But then that also limited what I could do at A Levels. I wasn't allowed to do A Level maths.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you mean you weren't allowed to?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because I had such a bad math grade from my GCSE, I only had a C.

I had a good chemistry teacher so in the end I got to university to do chemistry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So through that process, I think for kids in that situation, it's easy to start believing that you're not...

I don't really have that much advice other than don't give up. And one of the things I try to do as a chemistry professor in my group is I hire people that I think, if they're persistent enough, who am I to deny them the chance?

We could see on Earth that there's increasing levels of intelligence of organisms. We can see what humans with extra intelligence were able to do to the other species. So, that is a lot of samples of data, what a delta in intelligence gives you. When you have an increase in intelligence, how you're able to dominate a species on Earth. So, the idea there is that if you have a being that's 10x smarter than humans, we're not going to be able to predict what that being is going to be able to do, especially if it has the power to hurt humans. Which, you can imagine a lot of trajectories in which the more benefit AI systems give, the more control we give to those AI systems over our power grid, over our nuclear weapons, or weapons of any sort.

Because you can then use it to control, to regulate in a way that halts progress, to control people, and to cancel people, all that kind of stuff.

I think when you hear the word \"super-intelligent\", you're hearing, \"It's smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart.\" But the paperclip manufacturing system doesn't need to be smart in every way. It just needs to be smart in a set of specific ways. And the more capable the AI systems become, the more you could see us giving them control over, like I said, our power grid, a lot of aspects of human life.

Now, let's say there's some actors that are earnest. Let's say Yudkowsky is being earnest and he really cares. But he loves it. He goes, \"Da, da, da, and then you're all going to die.\" It's like, why don't we try and do the same thing and say, \"You could do this, and then you're all going to be happy forever after\"?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I think there's several things to say there. One, I think there is a role in society for people that say we're all going to die. Because I think it filters through as a message, as a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern. Meaning it's not 95%, but when you say 95% and it filters through society, it'll give an average of like a 0.03%. An average. So, it's nice to have people that are like, \"We're all going to die,\" and then we'll have a proper concern. For example, I do believe we're not properly concerned about the threat of nuclear weapons currently. It just seems like people have forgotten that that's a thing, and there's a war in Ukraine with a nuclear power involved. There's nuclear powers throughout the world, and it just feels like war in the brink of a potential world war to a percentage that I don't think people are properly calibrating in their head. We're all thinking it's a Twitter battle as opposed to actual threat. So, it's nice to have that kind of level of concern. But to me, when I hear AI doomers, what I'm imagining is with unintended consequences a potential situation where let's say 5% of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made, of unintended consequences. I don't want to imagine the entirety of human civilization dying, but there could be a lot of suffering if this is done poorly.<|eot_id|>"}

But I think the most interesting thing about knowing each other is we don't know what we're going to do next.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. Sure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean within some constraints I've got, I can predict some things about you. You can predict some things about me. But we can't predict everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it's because we can't predict everything is why we're exciting to come back and discuss and see. So yeah, I'm happy that it'll be interesting that some things that I've done can be captured, but I'm pretty sure that my angle on mining novelty for the future will not be captured.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. So that's what life is, is just some novelty generation and then you're done. Each one of us just generally a little bit. Or have the capacity to at least.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think life is a selection produces life. And life affects a universe. Universes with life in them are materially, physically, fundamentally different than universes without life. And that's super interesting. And I have no beginnings of understanding. I think maybe this is in a thousand years, there'll be a new discipline. And the humans will be like, \"Yeah, of course. This is how it all works.\" Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In retrospect, it'll all be obvious I think.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think assembly theory is obvious, that's why a lot of people got angry. They were like, \"Oh my God, this is such nonsense.\" And like, \"Oh, actually it's not quite.\" But the writing's really bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I can't wait to see where it evolves, Lee. And I am glad I get to exist in this universe with you. You're a fascinating human. This is always a pleasure. I hope to talk to you many more times. And I'm a huge fan of just watching you create stuff in this world. And thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a pleasure as always, Lex. Thanks for having me on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan. We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions, and the depth of our answers. Our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good. Thank you for listening. And hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
