The following is a debate between Ben Shapiro and Destiny. Each arguably representing the right and left of American politics respectively. They are two of the most influential and skilled political debaters in the world. This debate has been a long time coming for many years. It's about 2.5 hours and we could have easily gone for many more. And I'm sure we will. It is only round one. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro and Destiny. Ben, you're conservative. Destiny, you're a liberal. Can you each describe what key values underpin your philosophy on politics and maybe life in the context of this left to right political spectrum? You want to go first?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>course. And actually, this is what we used to hash out in legislatures before they turned into platforms for people grandstanding. But yes, sure. Okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As we descend from the heavens of philosophical discussion of conservatism and liberalism, let's go to the pragmatic muck of politics.

One of the big issues in this presidential election is going to be January 6th. It's in the news now, and I think it's going to become bigger and bigger and bigger. So question for Destiny first.
