{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients of simultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in terms of the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering, all of these elements that are discipline based or rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty in synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design, you are bound to create something novel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Neri Oxman, an engineer, scientist, designer, architect, artist, and one of the kindest, most thoughtful and brilliant human beings I've ever gotten to know. For a long time, she led the mediated matter group at MIT that did research and built incredible stuff at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, material science, and synthetic biology, doing so at all scales from the microscale to the building scale. Now she's continuing this work at a very new company for now called Oxman, looking to revolutionize how humans design and build products working with nature, not against it. On a personal note, let me say that Neri has for a long time been a friend and someone who in my darker moments, has always been there with a note of kindness and support. I am forever grateful to her. She's a brilliant and a beautiful human being. Oh, and she also brought me a present, War and Peace by Tolstoy and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. It doesn't get better than that. This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neri Oxman. Let's start with the universe. Do you ever think of the universe as a kind of machine that designs beautiful things at multiple scales?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. And I think of nature in that way in general. In the context of design, specifically, I think of nature as everything that isn't anthropomass, everything that is not produced by humankind, the birds and the rocks and everything in between, fungi, elephants, whales.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there's an intricate ways in which there's a connection between humans and nature?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and we're looking for it. I think that let's say from the beginning of mankind going back 200,000 years, the products that we have designed have separated us from nature. And it's ironic that the things that we designed and produced as humankind, those are exactly the things that separated us. Before that we were totally and completely connected, and I want to return to that world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But bring the tools of engineering and computation to it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I thought, well grow everything. That's sort of the slogan. Let's grow everything. And if we grow everything, is there a world in which driving a car is better for nature than a world in which there are no cars? Is it possible that a world in which you build buildings in cities, that those buildings in cities actually augment and heal nature as opposed to their absence? Is there a world in which we now go back to that kind of synergy between nature and humans where you cannot separate between grown and made? And it doesn't even matter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a good term for the intersection between biomass and anthropomass, things that are grown?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have computational power that is one trillion times the power that we had in those times. We have 26.5 trillion times the bandwidth and 11.5 quintillion times the memory, which is incredible. So humankind since the first computer has approached and accessed such incredible bandwidth, and we're asking, what if nature had that bandwidth? So beyond genes and evolution, if there was a way to augment nature and allow it access to the world of bits, what does nature look like now? And can nature make decisions for herself as opposed to being guided and guarded and abused by humankind?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So nature has this inherent wisdom that you spoke to, but you're also referring to augmenting that inherent wisdom with something like a large language model.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So compress human knowledge, but also maintain whatever is that intricate wisdom that allows plants, bacteria, fungi to grow incredible things at arbitrary scales, adapting to whatever environment and just surviving and thriving no matter where, no matter how.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so forth. And we don't have this data currently. And the part of our mission is to do just that, trying to quantify and understand the language that exists across all kingdoms of life, across all five kingdoms of life. And if we can understand that language, is there a way for us to first make sense of it, find logic in it, and then generate certain computational tools that empower nature to build better crops, to increase the level of biodiversity? In the company we're constantly asking, what does nature want? What does nature want from a compute view?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If it knew it, what could aid it in whatever the heck it's wanting to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>X, Y, and Z and that's pretty much where architectural education ends and biological education begins. So in reducing that dimensional mismatch, we're missing out on opportunities to create things made as if grown. But in the natural environment, we're asking, can we provide nature with these extra dimensions? And again, I'm not sure what nature wants, but I'm curious as to what happens when you provide these tools to the natural environments. Obviously with responsibility, obviously with control, obviously with ethics and moral code, but is there a world in which nature can help fix itself using those tools?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And by the way, we're talking about a company called Oxman.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Just a few words about the team.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What kind of humans work at a place like this? They're trying to figure out what nature wants.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think they're first like you, they're humanists first. They come from different disciplines and different disciplinary backgrounds. And just as an example, we have a brilliant designer who is just a mathematical genius and a computer scientist and a mechanical engineer who is trained as a synthetic biologist. And now we're hiring a microbiologist and a chemist, architects of course, and designers, roboticist. So really it's arc, two of each.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And always dancing between this line of the artificial, the synthetic, and the real, what's the term for it? And the natural<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the built and the grown nature and culture, technology and biology, but we're constantly seeking to ask how can we build, design and deploy products in three scales? The molecular scale, which I briefly hinted to. And there in the molecular scale we're really looking to understand whether there's a universal language to nature and what that language is. And then build a tool that I think and dream of it is the iPhone for nature. If nature had an iPhone, what would that iPhone look like?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does that mean creating an interface between nature and the computational tools we have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of a smoke cloud? Can they do this quote-unqoute \"automatically\" without a kind of a top-down brute force policy-based method that's authored and deployed by humans? And so this work really relates to that interface with the natural world. And then there's a second area in the company which focuses on growing products. And here we're focusing on a single product that starts from CO2. It becomes a product. It's consumed, it's used, it's worn by a human, and then it goes back to the soil and it grows an edible fruit plant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we're talking about from CO2 to fruit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It starts from CO2 and it ends with something that you can literally eat. So the world's first entirely biodegradable, biocompatible, bio renewable product.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's grown.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you need a little bit of this material and a little bit of that material to make it water resistant and then it's over. That's one thing that we're trying to solve for is how to create a product that is materially, computationally, robotically, novel, and goes through all of these phases from the creation, from this carbon recycling technology to the product, to literally, how do you think about reinventing an industry that is focused on assembly and putting things together and using humans to do that? Can that happen just using robots and microbes? And that's it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And doing it end to end. I would love to see what this factory looks like.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the factory is great too. I'm very, very excited. In October we'll share first renditions of some of this work and in February we'll invite you to the lab.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm there. I've already applied. I haven't heard back. I don't understand. Okay. Just before we get to number three, it'd be amazing to just talk about what it takes with robotic arms or in general, the whole process of how to build a life form stuff you've done in the past, maybe stuff you're doing now, how to use bacteria, this kind of synthetic biology, how to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria? Is there examples from the past and explain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>had a couple of pavilions made of silk, and the second one, which was the bigger one, which ended up at the Museum of Modern Art with my friend, an incredible mentor, Paul Antonelli, that pavilion was six meter tall and it was produced by silkworms. And there we had different types of templates. There were physical templates that were basically just these water soluble meshes upon which the silkworms were spinning and then there were environmental templates, which was a robot basically applying variation of environmental conditions such as heat and light to guide the movement of the silkworm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying so many amazing things, and I'm trying not to interrupt you, but one of the things you've learned by observing, by doing science on these is that the environment defines the shape that they create or contributes or intricately plays with the shape they create. And that's one of the ways you can get to guide their work is by defining that environment. By the way, you said hero organism, which is an epic term. That means whatever is the biological living system that's doing the creation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that's what's happening in pharma and biomaterials and by the way, precision ag and new food design technologies as people are betting on a hero organism, is sort of how I think of it. And the hero organism is sometimes it's the palm oil or it's the mycelium. There's a lot of mushrooms around for good and bad, and it's cellulose or it's fake bananas or the workhorse E. Coli. But these hero organisms are being betted on as the... What's the one answer that solves everything hitchhiker's guide?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>42.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>42.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. These are sort of the 42s of the enchanted new universe. And back at MIT, we said, instead of betting on all of these organisms, let's approach them as almost movement in a symphony and let's kind of lean into what we can learn from each of these organisms in the context of building a project in an architectural scale. And those usually were pavilions. And then the computational templating is the way you guide the work of this. How many did you say? 17,000?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>creates the cocoon. We then produce the silk of it and then it dies. So it has dysfunctional wings, it cannot fly. And that's another problem that the sericulture industry has is, why did we in the first place, author this organism 4,000 years ago that is unable to fly and is just there to basically live to serve a human need, which is textiles? And so here we were fascinated by the computational kind of biology dimension of silkworms, but along the way... By the way, this is great. I never get to tell the full story. So great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've enjoyed this so much.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People say, \"Oh, speak in [inaudible 00:24:54] paragraphs. They're way too long.\" And this is wonderful. This is like heaven.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 00:24:58] paragraphs. You're dropping so many good lines. I love it for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But really those silkworms, yes, they're not designed to be like humans. They're not designed to connect, communicate, and build things that are bigger than themselves through connection and communication.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what happens when you add 17,000 of them communicating effectively?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a really great question. What happens is that at some point, the templating strategies, and as you said correctly, there were geometrical, templating, material templating, environmental templating, chemical templating if you're using pheromones to guide the movement of bees in the absence of a queen where you have a robotic queen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Robotic queen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>virtue of feeling or rubbing against each other in an area that was hotter or colder. And so the product that we got at the end, the variation of density of fiber and the distribution of the fiber and the transparency, the product at the end seems like it was produced by a swarm silk community, but of course it wasn't. It's a bunch of biological agents working together to assemble this thing. That's really, really fascinating to us. How can technology augment or enable a swarm like behavior and creatures that have not been designed to work as swarms?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do you construct a computational template from which a certain kind of thing emerges? How can you predict what emerges, I suppose?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So if you can predict it doesn't count as emergence, actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a deeply poetic line.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We can talk about it. It's a bit exaggerated, doesn't count. Speaking of emergence, an empowerment, because we're constantly moving between those as if they're equals on the team and one of them, Christopher shared with me a mathematically equation for what does it mean to empower nature and what does empowerment in nature look like? And that relates to emergence. And we can go back to emergence in a few moments, but I want to say it so that I know that I've learned it and if I've learned it I can use it later.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And maybe you'll figure something out as you say it also.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>processes. His definition or the definition he found was that an agent is empowered if the entropy of the distribution of all of its states it's high while the entropy of the distribution of a single state given a choice, given an action is low. Meaning it's that kind of duality between opportunity like starting like this and going like this, opening and closing. And this really, I think is analogous to human empowerment, given infinite wide array of choices. What is the choice that you make to enable, to empower, to provide you with the agency that you need?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And how much does that making that choice actually control the trajectory of the system? That's really nice. So this applies to all the kinds of systems you're talking about.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>apply to a human on an individual basis or a silkworm or a bee or a microbe that has agency or by virtue of a template, but it also applies to a community of organisms like the bees. And so we've done a lot of work sort of moving from, you've asked how to grow things. So we've grown things using co fabrication where we're digitally fabricating with other organisms that live across the various kingdoms of life and those were silkworms and bees. And with bees, which we've sent to outer space and returned healthily and they were reproductive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, you're going to have to tell that story. You're going to have to talk about the robotic queen and the pheromones. Come on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>involved a technology that was associated with the project, and I never, ever, ever want to let that part go because I love technology so much. But also another element of this is that always, these projects, if they're great, they reveal new knowledge about, or new science about the topic that you're investigating, be it silkworms or bees or glass. That's why I say, I always tell my team it should be at MoMA and the cover of Nature or Science at the same time. We don't separate between the art and the science, it's one of the same.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as you're creating the art, you're going to learn something about these organisms or something about these materials. Is there something that stands out to you about these hero organisms like bees, silkworms? You mentioned E. coli has its pros and cons, this bacteria. What have you learned, small or big, that's interesting about these organisms?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's a beautiful question. What have I learned? I've learned that... We also worked with shrimp shells with a glow. How we built this tower on the roof of SF MoMa, which by a couple of months ago until it was on the roof, we've shown this structure completely biodegrade into the... Well, not completely, but almost completely biodegrade to the soil. And this notion that a product or an organism or part of that organism can reincarnate is very, very moving thought to me, because I want to believe that I believe in reincarnation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I want to believe that I believe. I want to believe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's my relationship with God. I like to believe in believing. Most great things in life are second derivatives of things, but that's part of another conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel like that's a quote that's going to take weeks to really internalize.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That notion of, I want you to want, or I need you to need. There's always something, a deeper truth behind what is on the surface. So I like to go to the second and tertiary derivative of things and discover new truths about them through that. But what have I learned about organisms-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And why don't you like E. coli?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I like E. coli, and a lot of the work that we've done was not possible without our working on E. coli or other workhorse organisms, like cyanobacteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How are bacteria used?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Death masks. The death masks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what are death masks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in a product. So it was like an air memento. So with Vespers, we actually used E. coli to create pigmented masks, masks whose pigments would be recreated at the surface of the mask. And I'm skipping over a lot of content, but basically there were 15 masks and they were created as three sets, the masks of the past, the masks of the present, and the masks of the future. They were five, five, and five, and the masks of the past were based on ornaments and they were embedded with natural minerals like gold. Yes, yes, yes, exactly-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we're looking at pictures of these and they're gorgeous.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Extremely delicate and interesting fractal patterns that are symmetrical.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They look symmetrical, but they're not. We intended for you to be tricked and think that they're all symmetrical, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's imperfections.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for them. And again, just to remind you, I forget the exact number, but it's around 1,000 cocoons per a single shirt that are exterminated in India and China, in those sericulture industries that are being abused. Now, yes, this organism was designed to serve the human species and maybe it's time to retire that conception of organisms that are designed for a human-centric world or human-centric set of applications. I don't feel the same way about E. coli, not that I'm organism agnostic, but still I believe there's so much for us to do on this planet with bacteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so in general, your design principle is to grow cool stuff as a byproduct of the organism flourishing. So not using the organism-<|eot_id|>"}

My husband is a good example for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, but just to clarify, in this case you are also trying to thrive in the black and white in that you're saying the silkworm is a beautiful, wonderful creature.

That's why I like to think about not recycling, but reincarnating, because that assumes, imparting upon nature that dimension of agency and maybe awareness. But yeah, lots of really interesting work happening with bacteria. Directed evolution is one of them. We're looking at directed evolution. So high-throughput directed evolution of bacteria for the production of products.

And so these capsules are designed as part of a lab. That's why it's been taking us such a long time to get to this point, because we started designing them in 2019, and they're currently, literally as I speak to you, under construction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How well is it understood how to do this dance of controlling these different variables in order for various kinds of growth to happen?<|eot_id|>"}

What we don't want to happen with AGI, we want to happen with synthetic biology. What we don't want to happen online and software with language, we want for it to happen with bio-based materials.

I see parallels here with another company of Neuralink, which is basically like, I think you mentioned, Neuralink for nature. That there are short-term products you can come up with, but it's ultimately a long-term challenge of how do you integrate the machine with this creation of nature, this intricate, complex creation of nature, which is the human brain.

This universal force is love.\" He also, the last paragraph in the letter, as you've mentioned, \" I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart, which has quietly beaten for you all my life. Maybe it's too late to apologize, but as time is relative,\" that jokes to Einstein, \"I need to tell you that I love you and thanks to you I have reached the ultimate answer. Your father, Albert Einstein.\" By that regret, I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart.

So I believe in love and I believe in the one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It might be the same thing, it might be a different thing, but let me ask you a ridiculously big philosophical question about beauty. Dostoevsky said Beauty will save the world in The Idiot, one of my favorite books of his. What is beauty to you? You've created through this intersection of engineering and nature, you have created some incredibly beautiful things. What do you think is beauty?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a beautiful question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe it is connected to the love question.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is connected to the love question. Of course, everything is connected to the love question. To me, beauty is agency. To me, something that has agency, it is beautiful. There is this special quote from Buckminster Fuller, which I cannot remember word for word but I remember the concept, which goes something like this. When I work on a problem, I never think about beauty. But when I'm done solving the problem and I look at what I've created and it's not beautiful, I know that I was wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's kind of an agency that speaks to the \"objective function\" of the creation, right? Whether for Bucky it's useless or useful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this idea of empowerment that you talked about, it's fundamentally connected to it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Comes back to that, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the difference that you hinted at between empowerment and emergence? Is emergence completely lacks control and empowerment is more controlled? There's an agent making decisions? Is there an interesting distinction there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. I think empowerment is a force with direction. It has directionality to it. Emergence is, I believe, multi-directional. Again, that depends on the application. Emergence is perhaps in terms of a material definition, is a tropic spirit. When empowerment, the end is a tropic counterpart, I think they overlap because I think that empowerment is a way of inspiring emergence. I think emergence does not happen without empowerment, but empowerment can happen without emergence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think of emergence as the loss of control? When you're thinking about these capsules and then the things they create, is emergence of things not a desirable conclusion?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the loss of control. And creativity is very much part of this because creativity is all about letting go and beginning again and beginning again and beginning again. And when you cannot let go, you cannot be creative and you can't find novelty. But I think that letting go is a moment that enables empowerment, agency, creativity, emergence, and they're all connected. They sort of associate themselves with definition of destiny or the inevitable. A good friend of mine shared with me elegant definition of fate, which is the ratio of who you are and who you want to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ratio of who you are, who want to be.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And that sort of ends up defining you and those tools, I think when you let go, you sort of find, you give peace to your will, to a sense of will. And so I think that's very, very important in design, but also in life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>She said this fate is the ratio of...<|eot_id|>"}

Do you think there's something to this whole manifestation thing like focusing on a vision of what you want the world to become and in that focusing you manifest it?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so, yes. And I always think of what I do as the culmination of energy, information, and matter and how to direct energy, information, and matter in the design of a thing or in the design of a life. I think living is very much a process of channeling these energies to where they need to go. I think that the manifestation or part of that manifestation is the pointing to the moon in order to get to the moon. And that's why manifestation is also directional. It has that vector quality to it that I think of agency as.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you in your own life.

It's sort of moving into the forest and seeing this wonder and getting close and learning about that and then moving to another wonder.

You mentioned imperfection in the death masks. What role does imperfection play in our conception of beauty? What role does imperfection play in nature?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as living beings, we're here to find meaning and that meaning cannot be found without struggle and without seeking to, not to perfect, but to build towards something better. When I was a child, my mother who I love so much, always explained to me how important it is to fall and to fail and to fight and to argue, and that there is a way, that there's a culture to failing and to imperfection. So I think it is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect and it is a sign of nature because nothing in nature is perfect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about human relations? You mentioned finding love. Are the flaws in humans, imperfection in humans, a component of love? What role do you think the flaws play?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>opposed to as an individual. So if there is a society of the mind, or if there are higher levels of awareness that can be accessed in community as opposed to again, going to the silkworm, as opposed to on the individual level, I think that those occur through the flaws and the vulnerabilities. And without them we cannot find connection, community. And without community, we can't build what we have built as a civilization for the past hundreds of thousands of years. So I think not only are they beautiful, but they have a functional role in building civilizations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a sense in which love requires vulnerability and maybe love is the leap into that vulnerability.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I think yes, I think a flaw, think about it physically, I'm thinking about a brick that's flawed, but in a way I think of a flaw as an increased surface area.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good line.

And he gets back on the bus with the rest of the passengers. And none of them seem to have noticed the magic. And I think if you just allow yourself to pause, just to feel whatever that is, maybe ultimately it's a kind of gratitude for, I don't know what it is.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>where humans, we are not alone and we are here because of those plants. I think death is very much part of life. In the context of the redwood tree, perhaps life is defined as 10 generations. And through the lens of a bacteria, perhaps life is defined as a millisecond. And perhaps through the lens of an AGI, life is defined as all of human civilization. And so I think it really is a question of this timescale again, the timescale and the organism, the life form that's asking the question through which we can answer, what is life?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about this? If we think of ourselves in the eye of the storm of another extinction, the natural question to ask here is you have all of nature and then you have this new human creation that is currently being termed artificial intelligence. How does your work play with the possibility of a future super intelligent ecosystem, an AGI that either joins or supersedes humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm glad you asked this question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And are you hopeful or terrified?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Both. I'm hopeful and terrified. I did watch your interview with Eliezer Yudkowsky and I loved it<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because you were scared or because you were excited or because there was a [inaudible 01:51:29]?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>First of all, I was both. Totally scared, shamed, excited, and totally also inspired because he's just such an incredible thinker. And I can agree or disagree with what he says, but I just found his way of thinking about AGI and the perils of humanity as a result.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's an inevitability to what he's saying. His advice to young people is that prepare for a short life. He thinks it's very almost simple. It's almost common sense that AGI would get rid of humans, that he can't imagine a trajectory eventually that leads to a place that doesn't have AGI kill all humans. There's just too many trajectories where a super intelligent systems gets rid of humans and in the near term. And so that clarity of thinking is very sobering. To me, maybe it is to you as well, it's super inspiring because I think he's wrong, but it's like you almost want to prove him wrong. It's like, \"No, we humans are a clever bunch. We're going to find a way.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and translate. That's sort of from data to information to knowledge. I think the next frontier is wisdom. And what is wisdom? Wisdom is the ability to have or find insight about the world and from wisdom to spiritual awareness, which sort of transcends wisdom and is able to chart the world into new territory. But I think what is interesting about AGI is that it is sort of almost like a self recursive thing, because it's like a washing machine of a third derivative Wikipedia. It uses kind of language to create language, to create language, to create language.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It feels like novelty is being constantly created. It doesn't feel like it's regurgitating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that it never had access to. Maybe through Eliezer's lens, the sort of short-lived human becomes sort of a very long-lived humanlike, sentient, weeping willow. Maybe that's the end in the beginning. And maybe on the more optimistic side for us humans, it's a different form of existence where everything we create and everything we consume and everything we process is all made out of six elements and that's it. And there's only those six elements and not 118 elements. And it's all the stuff of biology plus some fair amount of bits, genes, and atoms. A lot of Beethoven.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of Beethoven. I think the idea of connecting AGI to nature through your work is really fascinating. Sort of unlocking this incredible machinery of intelligence that is AGI and connecting it to the incredible machinery of wisdom that is nature has evolved through billions of years of pretty crazy intense evolution.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. Again, I'm going back to directed evolution. Unlike this sort of high throughput brute force approach, if there is a way to utilize this synergy for diversity and diversification, what happens if you ask a ChatGPT question, but it takes 10,000 years to answer that question? What does that look like when you completely switch the timescale and you can afford the time to answer the question? And again, I don't know, but that world to me is possibly amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because when we start to think about timescales like this, just looking at earth, all the possible trajectories it might take of this living organism that is earth, do you think there's others like it? Do you think there's other planets with life forms on them that are just doing their thing in this kind of way?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Planets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because in what you're doing, you're directly playing with what's possible with life, lifelike things. That kind of maps the question of, well, what kind of other things are possible elsewhere? Do you think there's other worlds full of life, full of alien life out there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>water and there's love. What else do you need? And that sort of very peculiar juxtaposition of conditions, the oxygen, the water, the carbon again, is in a way a miracle given the massive extinctions that we've been through as life forms. And that said, I cannot believe that there is no other life form. I want to believe more than I know that yes, that there are life forms in the white fountain that is the black hole, that there are these life forms that are light years away from us, that are forming other forms of life forces.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm much more worried about probably the thing that you're working on, which is that there's all kinds of life around us that we're not communicating with.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That there's aliens in a sense all around us that we're not seeing, that we're not talking to, that we're not communicating. Because that to me just seems the more likely situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That they're here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That they're here, they're all around us in different forms, that there's a thing that connects all of us, all of living beings across the universe, and we're just beginning to understand any of it. And I feel like that's the important problem is I feel like you can get there with the tools of science today by just studying life on earth. Unlock some really fundamental things that maybe you can start to answer questions about what is consciousness? Maybe this thing that we've been saying about love, but honestly, in a serious way. And then you'll start to understand that there is alien life all out there, and it's much more complicated and interesting than we kind of realize as opposed to looking to exactly human-like things. It's the variety of life that's possible is just almost endless.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I totally agree with you. I think again, define alien, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Define intelligence, define life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. And Marvin Minsky used to say, \"Intelligence is a suitcase word.\" It's a word so big. It's a word like sustainability, and it's a word like rock and roll. And suitcase words are always very, very dangerous.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of rock and roll, you've mentioned music and you mentioned Beethoven a bunch of times. You've also tweeted about you getting Kiss in performance and so on. What can you say about the role of music in your life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love music. I always wondered why is it that plastic arts, meaning architecture and sculpture and painting, can't get us to cry and music gets us to cry so quickly and connect so quickly? And no wonder that plants also respond to music, but that is at the top of the creative pyramid in my opinion.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a weird mystery that we're so connected to music. Well, by the way, to push back, a good bridge will make me cry.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's true. And I will say when I visited the Segreta Familia, I had that kind of spiritual reverence towards that spatial experience and being in that space and feeling the intention and the space and appreciating every little gesture. It's true. It is the universal language. It's the language of waves. It's the language of the waves, not the language of the particles. It is the universal language, I believe, and that is definitely one of my loves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you said that if you weren't doing what you were doing now, perhaps you would be a film director. I have to ask, what do you think is the best film of all time? Maybe top three?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe The Godfather.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Godfather, okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Godfather is definitely up there. Francis Coppola is one of my heroes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you met him?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the embodiment I believe, of ambivalence. And there's opportunity to believe in the beginning of humankind, the end of humankind, the planet, child star or star child of the future. Was there a death? Was there an reincarnation? That final scene to me is something that I go back to and study, and every time there is a different reading of that scene that inspires me. That scene, and then the first scene in The Godfather, still one of the best scenes of all times, sort of a portrait of America, the ideals and values that are brought from Italy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A family of loyalty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of values of how different values are constructed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Loyalty and the human spirit and how Coppola celebrates the human spirit through the most simple gestures in language and acting. And I think in Kubrick you see this highly curated and controlled and manicured vision of creating a film. And with Francis, it's like an Italian feast. It's like anything can happen at any moment in time. And just being on the set with him is an experience I'll take with me to my grave. It's very, very, very special.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you said music is also part of that, of creating a feeling in the movies?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, actually The Godfather, that tune-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That makes me emotional every time on some weird level.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's one of these tunes I'm sure that if you play it to a Jasmine, you'll get the best scent of all times. But I think with that particular tune, I learned staccato as something very, very happy and joyous. And then made into this stretched in time and became kind of the refrain of nostalgia and melancholy and loyalty and all of these values that ride on top of this one single tune.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can play it in all kinds of different ways. I've played it on guitar and all kinds of different ways. And I think in Godfather III, the son plays it on guitar to the father. I think this happens in movies, but sometimes a melody, and it has a simple melody, you can just like-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the Straus melody in 2001. And when you juxtapose this melodies with this scene, you get this, again, hole that's bigger than some of its parts where you get this moment, I think. These are the moments I would send with the next Voyager to outer space. The Godfather in 2001 would definitely beyond that golden record.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You are an incredibly successful scientist, engineer, architect, artist, designer. You've mentored a lot of successful people. Can you give advice to young people listening to this of how to have a successful career and how to have a successful life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>full moon. I take my time with a full moon and I pay attention to a full moon. And I think paying attention to the seasons and taking time to appreciate the little things, the simple things is what makes a meaningful life. I was very lucky to have grown up in a home that taught me this way of being. My parents, my grandmother, who played a very important role in my growing up. And that ability to pay attention and to be present is so, so, so, so ... I could not emphasize it enough, is so crucial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And be grateful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And be grateful.

What lessons have you learned from her?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>adulthood as a child. And so I am very, very grateful for that. I think it is the sense of wonder, the speaking up was always something that she adhered to, to speak up your truth, to be straightforward, to be positive. These are things that I also got from my mom. And from my mom, the sense of humor. She had the best sense of humor that I could think of and was just a joy to be around. And my father taught me everything. My father taught me everything I know. My mom taught me everything I feel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good way to put it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My grandma taught me everything I insight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I see the sense of wonder that just carries through everything you do. So I think you make your grandmother proud. Well, what about advice for how to have a career? You've had a very interesting career and a successful career, but not an easy one. You took a few leaps.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>whereas learning is something that comes from within. It's also the difference between joy and happiness. Many times I'm sad and I'm still joyous. And it's very, very important to understand the difference between these externally perceived success paths and internally driven value-based ways of being in the world. And together, when we combine the broken puzzle, let's say, of substance and vulnerability, we get this bigger gestalt, this wondrous world of a future that is peaceful, that is wholesome, and that proposes or advocates for that kind of synergy that we've been talking about throughout.
