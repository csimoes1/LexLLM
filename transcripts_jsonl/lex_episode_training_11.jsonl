{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it take so long? Why did we wait until after 12,000 years ago, really after 10,000 years ago to start seeing the beginnings of civilization?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Graham Hancock, a journalist and author who for over 30 years has explored the controversial possibility that there existed a lost civilization during the last ice age and that it was destroyed in a global cataclysm some 12,000 years ago. He is the presenter of the Netflix documentary series, Ancient Apocalypse, the second season of which has just been released and it's focused on the distant past of the Americas. A topic I recently discussed with the archeologist Ed Barnhart. Let me say that Ed represents the kind of archeologist scholar I love talking to on the podcast, extremely knowledgeable, humble, open minded, and respectful in disagreement. I'll do many more podcasts on history, including ancient history. Our distant past is full of mysteries, and I find it truly exciting to explore those mysteries with people both on the inside and the outside of the mainstream in the various disciplines involved. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Graham Hancock. Let's start with a big foundational idea that you have about human history. That there was an advanced Ice Age civilization that came before and perhaps seeded what people now call the sixth cradles of Civilization, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Indies, and Mesoamerica. So let's talk about this idea that you have. Can you at the highest possible level describe it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Younger Dryas event was a massive global cataclysm, whatever caused it. And it's strange that just after it we start seeing these first signs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the current understanding in mainstream archeology is that after the Younger Dryas is when the civilizations popped up in different places of the globe with a lot of similarities, but they popped up independently.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the first civilizations, Sumer, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, China, they all pop up at pretty much the same time. That is the mainstream view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they don't just pop up, they kind of build up gradually. First there's some settlements.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, definitely, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's different dynamics of how they build up and the role of agriculture. And that is also non-obvious, but it's just there's first a kind of settlement, a stabilization of where the people are living. Then they start using agriculture, then they start getting urban centers and that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that word deliberately, was closed down and buried. Agriculture was all around it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>absolutely introduced by Anatolian farmers who traveled west. So the notion of dissemination of ideas perhaps shouldn't be so annoying to archeologists as it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And perhaps we should also state, if we look at the entirety of history of hominids, humans or hominids have been explorers.

And we should also mention, since we're talking about controversial debates going on, as I understand there's still debates about the dynamics of all that was going on there.

I think a lot of anatomically modern human evolution took place outside Africa as well, not only in Africa.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I guess the general puzzlement that you're filled with is given that these creatures explore and spread and try out different environments, why did it take hundreds of thousands of years for them to develop complicated society settlements?<|eot_id|>"}

They're able to do two things. One, tell stories about the gods of whatever, based on the stars.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>populations. That is the hypothesis that I'm putting forward. I'm not claiming that it's a fact. But, for me, it helps to explain the evidence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That speaks to one of the challenges that archeologists provide to this idea, is that there is a lot of evidence of humans in the ice age and they appear to be all hunter-gatherers.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>percent. Even a tiny percent of every archeological site has been studied by archeologists, too.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sounds good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To me, the story that we've been talking about... It is both exciting if the mainstream archeology narrative is correct and the one you're constructing is correct. Both are super interesting because the mainstream archeology perspective means that there's something about the human mind from which the pyramids/these ideas spring naturally. You place humans anywhere. You place them on Mars. It's going to come out that way. That's an interesting story of human psychology that then becomes even more interesting when you evolve out of Africa with homo sapiens, how they think about the world. That's super interesting. Then, if there's an ancient civilization/advanced civilization that explains why there's so many similar types of ideas that spread, that means that there's so much undiscovered still about the spring of these ideas of civilization that come. To me, they're both fascinating. I don't know why there's so much infighting.<|eot_id|>"}

Can make the case that that is indeed what happened; is it was hunter-gatherers for a long time, and then there was a cataclysm, a very difficult period in human history with the Younger Dryas, and that changed the environment and then led to the springing up of civilizations at different places on earth?

It seems like you could adapt much better if you are a more complicated organism. It took a really long time to take that leap. Is it because it's really hard to do? And what was the forcing function to do that kind of leap? And the same. For us to be selfish and self-obsessed for us humans, what was the magic leap to Homo sapiens from the other hominids? And why did Homo sapiens win out against the Neanderthals and the other competitors? Why are they not around anymore?

We're able to use our imagination to construct ideas and share those ideas and tell great stories and that is somehow an evolutionary advantage. Do you have any favorite conceptions of-<|eot_id|>"}

The fact of the matter is that Neanderthals and Denisovans did not survive the rise of Homo sapiens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For our discussion, though, what is interesting is all the hominids seem to be explorers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They spread. I didn't know this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think I'm doing. I'm exercising my urge to explore the past in my own way, making my own path and defining my own route.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the leap from non-human to human. One of the things you've discussed is your idea of what was the leap to human civilization? What is the driver? What is the inspiration for humans to form civilizations? And for you, that's shamanism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Definitely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain what that means?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>shamans are still using in the Amazon to this day. And I do see them as scientists in a very proper use of the word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But do you think something like ayahuasca was a part of that process?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the Amazon. And they've gone around and they've found just two or three of them that put together can produce these extraordinary visionary experiences.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just imagine the number of plants they had to have eaten, consumed and smoked or all kinds of combinations to arrive at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>another in one way. You can access them through LSD and you certainly can access them through psilocyb mushrooms as well in large enough dose.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Both possibilities, as you describe, are interesting. And to me, they're kind of akin to each other. I wonder what the limit of the brain's capacity is to create imaginary worlds and treat them seriously and make them real, and in those worlds, explore and have real moral, deep brainstorming sessions with those entities. So it's almost like the power of the human mind to imagine taken to its limit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for this? Yeah, I get the notion of hallucinations and brightly colored visuals, but the moral lessons that come with it, those are very odd.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And would you say that the reason that could give birth to a civilization, is it because such visions can help create myths, and especially religious myths, that would be a cohesive thing for a large group of people to get around?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. And can help us to be better members of our own community.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, with moral lessons.<|eot_id|>"}

I mentioned to you, I recently interviewed Donald Trump, and I actually brought up this same idea that it would be a much better world if most of Congress and most politicians would take some form of psychedelic, at the very least.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for society to allow that to happen, and not to have big government taking responsibility for decisions that should be in the hands of individuals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And for me also, it's exciting. Some of these substances like psilocybin are being integrated into scientific studies in large scales. It's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm not sure if it'll happen as fast as I would like to see it happen in my lifetime, but it is going to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I actually just recently found out that you had a TED Talk, War on Consciousness, that was taken down, and that was just part of just the general resistance. Because it was a pretty... It wasn't radical. It wasn't really a radical-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that are not acceptable to those in positions of power are simply dismissed and shut down, or at least attempts are made to do so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In general, just along that line of thinking, I'm pretty sure that what we understand about consciousness today will seem silly to humans from a hundred years from now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>why they're so similar from people from different age groups and different genders and different parts of the world, they're all having the same experiences.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And for me, from an engineer perspective, it's interesting if it's possible to engineer consciousness in artificial beings. It's another way to approach the question of how special is human consciousness. From where does it arise? Is it something that permeates all of life? And then in that case, what is the thing that makes life special? What is life? What is these living organisms that we have here that evolve to create humans? And what is truly special about humans? It's both scary and exciting to consider the possibility that we can create something like this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that it can manifest in physical forms where it can then have experiences that would not be available in the non-physical state. That's a guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That'd be a fascinating... Because then you can construct all kinds of physical forms to manifest the consciousness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And see if consciousness enters, if they become conscious. Isn't there some suggestion that artificial intelligence is already becoming conscious?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That makes humans really uncomfortable, because we are at the top of the food chain, we consider ourselves truly special, and to consider that there's other things that could be special is scary.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It might be very interesting to go down that route and see where it comes. Certainly in terms of exploring consciousness, it is very interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, fear is a useful thing, but it can also be destructive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it can be destructive and it can shut you down completely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you look into the future, maybe the next a hundred years, what do you hope are the interesting discoveries in archeology that we'll find?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And as new tech is revealing these previously unknown inner spaces within the Great Pyramid, I think that's going to become more and more likely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So not just the how it was built, but the why.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But the why.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to you, it seems obvious that there would be a cosmic motivation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that saying comes from. It comes from the Hermetica. But it's expressing an ancient Egyptian idea, to mirror the perfection of the heavens on earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you think there's something interesting to be discovered about the how it was built? You mean beyond the ideas of using ramps and wet sand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's so many different theories. We haven't got the answer yet. But the how of it is one of the big mysteries from our past.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love the Great Pyramids as a kind of puzzle that was created by the ancient peoples to be solved by later peoples. I don't know if you're aware of the 10,000-year clock that was built by Jeff Bezos and Danny Hillis in Sierra Diablo mountains in Texas. They're building a clock that ticks once a year for 10,000 years.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's talking about... And it's supposed to sort of run, if there's a nuclear apocalypse, it just runs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It'll keep running.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's an example of modern humans thinking like, okay, if 10,000 years from now and beyond, if something goes wrong or the future humans that are way different come back and they analyze what happened here, how can we create monuments that they could then analyze, and in that way be curious about. In their curiosity, discover some deep truths about this current time. It's an interesting kind of notion of what can we build now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would last. And the answer is that the majority of what we build now wouldn't last.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It wouldn't.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and messed up the dating sequences and so on and so forth, or vandalized it or used it as a quarry. It's all there intact.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned that the pyramids, and some of the other amazing things that humans have built, was the result of us humans struggling with our mortality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>no experiment that proves that's the case. We know we die, but we don't know whether there's such a thing as a soul or not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's the great mystery.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that notion is found right around the world, and it even manifests into the three monotheistic faiths that are still present in the world today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you're one such human, and you said you contemplate your own death.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you afraid of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of sense.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We are immersed in mystery. We live in the midst of mystery. We're surrounded by mystery.
