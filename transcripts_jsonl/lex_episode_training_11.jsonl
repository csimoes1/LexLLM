{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The big question for me in that timeline is why didn't we do it sooner? Why did it take so long? Why did we wait until after 12,000 years ago, really after 10,000 years ago to start seeing the beginnings of civilization?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Graham Hancock, a journalist and author who for over 30 years has explored the controversial possibility that there existed a lost civilization during the last ice age and that it was destroyed in a global cataclysm some 12,000 years ago. He is the presenter of the Netflix documentary series, Ancient Apocalypse, the second season of which has just been released and it's focused on the distant past of the Americas. A topic I recently discussed with the archeologist Ed Barnhart. Let me say that Ed represents the kind of archeologist scholar I love talking to on the podcast, extremely knowledgeable, humble, open minded, and respectful in disagreement. I'll do many more podcasts on history, including ancient history. Our distant past is full of mysteries, and I find it truly exciting to explore those mysteries with people both on the inside and the outside of the mainstream in the various disciplines involved. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Graham Hancock. Let's start with a big foundational idea that you have about human history. That there was an advanced Ice Age civilization that came before and perhaps seeded what people now call the sixth cradles of Civilization, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Indies, and Mesoamerica. So let's talk about this idea that you have. Can you at the highest possible level describe it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>felt this for a very long while, that there are major missing pieces in our story. It's often said that I'm claiming to have proved that there was an advanced lost civilization in the Ice Age. And I am not claiming to have proved that. That is a hypothesis that I'm putting forward to answer some of the questions that I have about prehistory. And I think it's worthwhile to inquire into those possibilities because the Younger Dryas event was a massive global cataclysm, whatever caused it. And it's strange that just after it we start seeing these first signs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the current understanding in mainstream archeology is that after the Younger Dryas is when the civilizations popped up in different places of the globe with a lot of similarities, but they popped up independently.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Independently. And by coincidence. And by coincidence, those big civilizations that we all remember as the first civilizations, Sumer, Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, China, they all pop up at pretty much the same time. That is the mainstream view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they don't just pop up, they kind of build up gradually. First there's some settlements.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, definitely, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's different dynamics of how they build up and the role of agriculture. And that is also non-obvious, but it's just there's first a kind of settlement, a stabilization of where the people are living. Then they start using agriculture, then they start getting urban centers and that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>during the construction of Gobekli Tepe, we see agriculture beginning to be adopted. The people who created Gobekli Tepe were all hunter-foragers at the beginning. But by the time Gobekli Tepe was finished, and it was definitely deliberately finished, closed off, closed down, deliberately buried, covered with earth, covered with rubble, and then topped off with a hill, which is why Gobekli Tepe is called what it is, Gobekli Tepe means pot-bellied hill or the hill of the navel. For a long time, Gobekli Tepe was thought to be just a hill that looked a bit like a pot belly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You say how it was discovered, I think this is one of the most fascinating things on Earth, period. So maybe can you say what it is and how it was discovered?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they abandoned the site and never looked at it further. And it wasn't until the German Archaeological Institute got involved, and particularly Klaus Schmidt, who I think was a genius, had real insight into this and started to dig at Gobekli Tepe that they'd realized what they'd found, that they'd found potentially the oldest megalithic site in the world. And they'd found it at a place where agriculture, according to the established historical timeline, that's where agriculture, at any rate in Europe and Western Asia begins. It begins in Anatolia, in Turkey, and then it gradually disseminates westward from there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And yet the understanding is it was created by hunter-gatherers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was created by hunter-gatherers. Yeah, there was no agriculture 11,600 years ago in Gobekli Tepe. But by the time Gobekli Tepe was decommissioned, and I use that word deliberately, was closed down and buried. Agriculture was all around it. And this was agriculture of people who knew how to cultivate plants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do we have an understanding when it was turned into a, if I could say a time capsule so protected by forming a mound around it?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>firm root by then. Actually, one other thing, I'll just say this in passing. When I talk about a lost civilization introducing ideas to people, I'm often accused of stealing credit from the indigenous people who had those ideas in the first place. So I do find it slightly hypocritical that archeology fully accepts that the idea of agriculture was introduced to Western Europe from Turkey, and that Western Europeans didn't invent agriculture. It was absolutely introduced by Anatolian farmers who traveled west. So the notion of dissemination of ideas perhaps shouldn't be so annoying to archeologists as it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And perhaps we should also state, if we look at the entirety of history of hominids, humans or hominids have been explorers.

And we should also mention, since we're talking about controversial debates going on, as I understand there's still debates about the dynamics of all that was going on there.

I think there is an urge to find out what's around the next corner, what's over the brow of the next hill. And I think that goes very deep into human character. And I think it was being manifested in those early adventures of people who left Africa and traveled all around the world and then settling in different parts of the world. I think a lot of anatomically modern human evolution took place outside Africa as well, not only in Africa.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I guess the general puzzlement that you're filled with is given that these creatures explore and spread and try out different environments, why did it take hundreds of thousands of years for them to develop complicated society settlements?<|eot_id|>"}

And the fascination with this numbers system and its discovery all around the world is one of the puzzles that intrigue me.

That may well be a Babylonian or Greek convention, but that the constellations were there I think was very clear. And that they were special constellations, unlike other ones higher up in the sky which were not on the path of the sun, that people paid attention to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, but detecting the procession of the equinox is hard because especially they don't have any writing systems, they don't have any mathematical systems.

And so carefully done that actually, it doesn't matter whether the storyteller knows that they're passing on that information or not. The story itself is the vehicle. And as long as it's repeated faithfully, the information contained within it will be passed on.

But that's the argument largely of archeology, dealing with the flood myths, or that some local population experienced a nasty local flooding event and they decided to say that it affected the whole world. I'm not persuaded by that, particularly since we know there was a nasty epoch, the Younger Dryas, when flooding did occur, and when the Earth was subjected to events cataclysmic enough to extinguish entirely the megafauna of the ice age.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis that provides an explanation of what happened during this period that resulted in such rapid environmental change.

This is a period which is very tightly defined, it's a period when we know that human populations were grievously disturbed. That's when the so-called Clovis culture of North America vanished entirely from the record during the Younger Dryas. And it's the time when the mammoths and the saber-toothed tigers vanished from the record as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a good understanding of what happened geologically, whether there was an impact or not?

He fully accepts that the Younger Dryas was a global cataclysm and that the extinctions took place, but he thinks it was caused by some kind of massive solar outburst. What everybody's agreed on is the Younger Dryas was bad, but there is dispute about what caused it.

I suggest it's likely this was during the period of the Roman Empire. I suggest it's likely that some of those maps were taken out of the library and taken to Constantinople, and that's where they were liberated during the crusade and entered world culture again and started to be copied and recopied.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From this perspective, when we talk about advanced ice age civilization, it could have been a relatively small group of people with the technology of their scholars of the stars and their expert seafaring navigators.<|eot_id|>"}

And this, again, is where you come to a series of mysteries, which are perhaps best expressed on the Giza Plateau in Egypt with the three Great Pyramids. And the extraordinary megalithic temples that many people don't pay much attention to on the Giza Plateau and the Great Sphinx itself. This is an area of particular importance in understanding this issue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, can you actually describe the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids and what you find most mysterious and interesting about them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>were closely involved in the construction of the Great Pyramids as we see them today.

Actually, the Great Pyramid is built around a natural hill. That natural hill might've been seen as the original primeval mound to the ancient Egyptians.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the idea is that the Sphinx was there long before the pyramids, and the pyramids were built by the Egyptians to celebrate further an already holy place.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

They built what's now known as the Queen's Chamber as his burial chamber. But then they decided that wouldn't do either. They then built the King's chamber, and that's where the Pharaoh is supposed to have been buried. Those Arab raiders under Khalifa al-Mamun didn't find anything in the Great Pyramid at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your idea is that the Sphinx and maybe some aspects of the pyramid were much earlier.

Finally, it burst into full form in the fourth dynasty in Ancient Egypt. The notion that knowledge might be transferred over thousands of years shouldn't be absurd. We know, for example, in the case of ancient Israel... It goes back to the time of Abraham, which is pretty much, I think, around 2000 BC.

Although interestingly, some of those tribes are now using cell phones. That possibility may have been there in the past. Only when we come to a global cataclysm does it become essential to have outreach and, actually, to take refuge amongst those hunter-forager populations. That is the hypothesis that I'm putting forward. I'm not claiming that it's a fact. But, for me, it helps to explain the evidence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That speaks to one of the challenges that archeologists provide to this idea, is that there is a lot of evidence of humans in the ice age and they appear to be all hunter-gatherers.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right. Very tiny percent. Even a tiny percent of every archeological site has been studied by archeologists, too.

It is both exciting if the mainstream archeology narrative is correct and the one you're constructing is correct. Both are super interesting because the mainstream archeology perspective means that there's something about the human mind from which the pyramids/these ideas spring naturally. You place humans anywhere. You place them on Mars. It's going to come out that way. That's an interesting story of human psychology that then becomes even more interesting when you evolve out of Africa with homo sapiens, how they think about the world. That's super interesting. Then, if there's an ancient civilization/advanced civilization that explains why there's so many similar types of ideas that spread, that means that there's so much undiscovered still about the spring of these ideas of civilization that come.

Let's put genetically engineered bacteria into cryogenic chambers and fire them off into the universe in all directions.\" And bottom line of Crick's theory in Life Itself is one of those cryogenic containers containing bacterial life from another solar system crashed into the early Earth.

For example, I think like three billion years it was single-cell organisms. So it seems like life was pretty good for single-cell organisms, that there was no need for multicellularity that for animals, for any of this kind of stuff. So why is that? It seems like you could adapt much better if you are a more complicated organism. It took a really long time to take that leap. Is it because it's really hard to do? And what was the forcing function to do that kind of leap? And the same. For us to be selfish and self-obsessed for us humans, what was the magic leap to Homo sapiens from the other hominids? And why did Homo sapiens win out against the Neanderthals and the other competitors? Why are they not around anymore? So those are all fascinating mysteries and it feels like the more we propose radical ideas about our past and take it seriously and explore the more we'll be able to figure out that puzzle that leads all the way back to Homo sapiens and maybe all the way back to the origin of life on Earth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah.

That's another suggestion of why the Neanderthals died out. There's lots of possibilities that have been put forward. Maybe we just out-competed them. Maybe anatomically modern humans had some brain connections that they didn't have. Even though the Neanderthal brain was bigger than the brain of anatomically modern human beings, as the old saying goes, size isn't everything. Maybe we just had a more compact, more efficient brain. The fact of the matter is that Neanderthals and Denisovans did not survive the rise of Homo sapiens.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For our discussion, though, what is interesting is all the hominids seem to be explorers.<|eot_id|>"}

And there are a few cultures that really intensely, deeply studied that mystery. We are not one of them. The general view of science, I think, is that we're accidents of evolution. When we die, the light blinks out. There's no more of us. There's no such thing as the soul. But that's not a proven point. There's no experiment that proves that's the case. We know we die, but we don't know whether there's such a thing as a soul or not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's the great mystery.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a great mystery that we all share, and those cultures that have investigated it, and Ancient Egypt is the best example, have investigated it thoroughly and map out the journey that we make after death. But that notion of a journey after death and of hazards and challenges along the way and ultimately of a judgment, that notion is found right around the world, and it even manifests into the three monotheistic faiths that are still present in the world today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you're one such human, and you said you contemplate your own death.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you afraid of it?<|eot_id|>"}

And he found several subjects, children under the age of seven in India, who were able to remember specific details of a past life, and he was able to go to the place where that past life unfolded and validate those details. So if consciousness is the basis of everything, if it's the essence of everything, and consciousness benefits in some way from being incarnated in physical form, then reincarnation makes a lot of sense. All the investment that the universe has put into creating this home for life may have a much bigger purpose than just accident.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What a beautiful mystery this whole thing is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We are immersed in mystery. We live in the midst of mystery. We're surrounded by mystery. And if we pretend otherwise, we're deluding ourselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And Graham, thank you so much for inspiring the world to explore that mystery. Thank you for talking today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you, Lex. It's been a pleasure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Graham Hancock.

And now let me leave you with some words from Charles Darwin. \"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
