{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Jennifer Burns, a historian of ideas including the evolution of economic, political, and social ideas in the United States in the 20th century to today. She wrote two biographies, one on Milton Friedman and the other on Ayn Rand, both of which I highly recommend. This was a super technical and super fascinating conversation. At the end, I make a few comments about my previous conversation with President Zelensky for those of you who may be interested. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Jennifer Burns. You have written two biographies, one on Milton Friedman and one on Ayn Rand. So if we can, we will focus on each one separately, but first, let's talk about the ideas that two of them held in common, the value of individual freedom, skepticism of collectivism, and the ethics of capitalism. Can you talk about the big picture ideas they converge on?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how they approach capitalism, how they approach thinking. Ayn Rand developed her own moral and philosophical system to justify individualism, and to connect the individual to capitalism, and to support capitalism as a social and economic system. Friedman struggles a bit more with how to justify capitalism, and he'll ultimately come down to freedom as his core value, like his God, as he says. So, freedom does connect back to the individual, but he's not justifying capitalism for his own sake. He's justifying it for its ability to underwrite freedom in a social sense and also in the individual sense<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At a high level, are there interesting differences between them? You already mentioned a few, maybe in terms of who they are personally, maybe in terms of how they approach the justification for capitalism, maybe other ways.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if it doesn't match. Milton Friedman, he also does tend to have friends who agree with him, yet he's always willing to debate his opponents, and he's willing to do so with a smile on his face. He's a happy warrior, and he actually will win a lot of debates simply by his emotional affect and his cheerfulness and his confidence, where Rand will lose debates because she gets so angry in the face of disagreement. So, they have a lot of similarities and a lot of differences, and it's been really fascinating to dive deep into both of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I just re-listened to Ayn Rand's, I think, last lecture, or at least it's called that, and just the confrontational nature of how she answers questions or how she addresses critics and so on. There is a kind of charisma to that. So, I think both of them are very effective at winning over a popular support, but in very different styles. It seems like Ayn Rand is very cranky, but I mean, is the most charismatic, cranky person I think I've ever listened to.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Now after a while for most people, that then became confining, but that certainty. Friedman had some of that as well. He clothed it differently. He clothed it in happiness where Rand closed it, as you said, in crankiness or anger. I mean, there's also an arc to Rand. She gets angrier and angrier and crankier and crankier over the course of her life. What I enjoyed about my research is I was able to get into this early moment when she was different and a little more open, and then I watched her close and her harden over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would it be fair to say that Milton Friedman had a bit more intellectual humility where he would be able to evolve over time, and be convinced by the reality of the world to change the nuances of policies, the nuances of how he thought about economics or about the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, absolutely. Friedman believed in being able to say, \"I was wrong.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>life, it's about two years before he dies, there's a note of doubt about how globalization unfolded, and what it would mean particularly for the American worker. So, you can see him still thinking, and that to me, I had assumed he became crankier and crankier and more and more set in his ways. Of course, there's a phase where he does become that way, especially as he's in the public eye, and there's not room for nuance. But to find in the last years of his life him being so reflective, that was absolutely not something Rand could do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there's a thread throughout this conversation where we should actually also say that you're a historian of ideas. How's that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I am a historian of ideas, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, we're talking about today in part about two people who fought for ideas, for an idea, like we've mentioned freedom for capitalism. They did it in very different ways. It's so interesting to see the impact they both had and how their elucidation explanation of those ideas reverberated throughout society, and how we together as a society figure out what works, the degree to which they have influence on the public, the degree to which they have influence on individual administrations like the Reagan administration, Nixon and so on, and how it might return, fade away, and then come back in the modern times. It's so interesting if you just see this whole world as a game of ideas where we were pushing and pulling and trying to figure stuff out. A bunch of people got real excited over 100 years ago about communism, and then they try stuff out, and then the implementation broke down, and we keep playing with ideas. So, these are the two greats of playing with ideas. I think that's a thread that just runs through this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>movement towards communism, social democracy. But one difference that I really should emphasize, Rand is a writer of fiction. She's a philosopher, but she's also a writer of fiction. So, she is working almost in the mythic register, much more in the psychological register. She's creating characters that people identify with and people relate to experiences they've had, and that's one of the reasons she hits so deep. She's also offering people... I read all the fan letters to her. People would say things like, \"I read The Fountainhead, and now I'm getting a divorce,\" having just these incredible realizations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Milton Friedman didn't get such letters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on these, but he doesn't create them, and he's more kind of playing a tune he already has. Whereas I think Rand really does something a little bit deeper in her ability to reach into people's psyche, and then take that emotional psychological experience, and fuse it to an intellectual world and a political world. That's really what makes her so powerful. So, I think she comes back in to relevancy in a different way than Friedman does, because I think in some ways she's tapped into a more universal human longing for independence and autonomy and self-creation and self-discovery.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nevertheless, there's still pragmatic ideas that are still important today from Milton Friedman, even just on the economics level. So, let's dig in. Let me try. I took some notes. Let me try to summarize who Milton Friedman is, and then you can correct me. So, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential economists in history, not just the 20th century, I think, ever. He was an advocate of economic freedom, like we said, and just individual freedom in general. He strongly advocated for free market capitalism and limited government intervention in the economy, though you do give... I've listened to basically everything you have on the internet. You give some more depth and nuance on his views on this in your books. He led the famed Chicago School of Economics, and he won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976. He greatly influenced economic policies during the Reagan administration and other administrations. He was an influential public intellectual, highly influential, not just among economists. He lived 1912 to 2006. So, that means he lived and worked through some major world events where his ideas were really important, the Great Depression with the New Deal, World War Two with post-war reconstruction, the Rise and Fall of the Bretton Woods Monetary System as we may talk about, the Cold War and all the conflicts involved in that, the tensions around communism and so on, so the fall of the Soviet Union. Also, he has some interesting relationships to China's economic transformation since the 1970s, the stagflation of the 1970s, and I'm sure there's a lot more. So, can you maybe continue this thread, and give a big picture overview of the ideas he's known for?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Reserve. We have lived through this, the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve is ready to loan. Covid, the Federal Reserve does all kinds of new things, because no Federal Reserve chair wants to be in Friedman-Schwartz 2.0 that somebody writes, where they're the bad guy who let the economy meltdown. So, the specifics of what they say to do have obviously evolved as the system has changed, but this is a playbook for how to deal with economic crisis. It's Friedman and Schwartz. So, it's absolutely fundamental, and that is really going to be the place he makes his mark.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of things to say here. So first, the book we're talking about is a monetary history of the United States, in part for which Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize. You've also mentioned the influence of the Great Depression, if you could even just rewind to that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, he went to, I guess, college in Rutgers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He was mathematical proclivities, so he was wanted to be a mathematician. So, it's a cool crossroads. It's interesting how the right time, the right person arrives. So, you described this really well, that he had this choice to be a mathematician or an economist. The economist is the University of Chicago. Mathematician is Brown University, whichever, and then this is also the beginnings, as you've described, of mathematical economics. So, he fits in nicely into this using... I think you said the number of equations started going up per paper-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... which is a really nice way to put it, so really the right person at the right time to try to solve this puzzle of the economy melting down. It's so interesting, just one human. It's just from just zooming in on a single human making a decision about life. It's hard to know when you're in it that the world is melting down from an economics perspective, and that I could do something about this to figure out what it is. Also, I'm going to reject the mainstream narrative about why this happened.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of his graduate career, he goes to Columbia University where he actually gets his PhD from. He works with a mathematical economist there. So, he comes out trained in what will eventually be econometrics, statistics and economics. His early publications are in statistics, but it's not really where his intellectual heart and soul are. Eventually, he will turn very profoundly against mathematics and economics, and become a heterodox strain throughout 20th century economics. It says, \" Simple models are better. We need to work off empirical data, not construct elegant models,\" and becomes really counter-cultural within economics in that way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The test of a good model is it should actually predict stuff that happened.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It should predict stuff that happened. It should tie back to what's going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm wondering which direction to go. So first, actually, if we could zoom out on the different schools of economics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just the basics. You mentioned Neoclassical. We mentioned Keynesian economics. We mentioned... What else did we mention? Well, the Chicago School of Economics.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where does Austrian economics fit into that pile, and Marxian economics? Can we just even just linger and try to redefine Keynesian economics and Chicago School of Economics and Neoclassical economics and Austrian economics, because there's some overlap and contention?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>really interesting work in the history of economics that shows a lot of the people who developed marginalism were looking to physics as a model, Physics, the queen of the sciences. So, they were thinking... They imported terms from the natural world to describe the social world through the lens of economics terms like equilibrium. So, the idea being that if you looked at a market, a market would reach equilibrium when everybody has bought and sold all that they want, or the price will settle at an equilibrium price when it's really the demand and supply are matching up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some of these ideas are things we would pick up at a microeconomics class.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>social control. The state and the people, collectively and democratically, need to control the way economics unfolds and make sure things are fair and equal. So, that school of thought becomes known as institutional economics in the United States by the 20th century. So, it's part of the progressive movement late 19th century, into the 20th century, it really becomes institutional economics and it's quite dominant and the neoclassical economists are still there but they're very much a minority. And Frank Knight, Milton Friedman's teacher, is one of the minority neoclassical economists and the institutionalists are much more progressive still.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it fair to say that the neoclassical folks and even the classical folks versus the institutional economics folks, they have a disagreement about how much government intervention that should be in the economy? So, neoclassical is less intervention and then an institutional economists, the progressive folks is more intervention?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>written a whole book on business cycles. He doesn't see this business cycle coming and it hits and he doesn't have a good explanation for it. Now, perhaps the preeminent neoclassical economist was Irving Fisher. Now, Irving Fisher is big into the stock market and Irving Fisher says sometime in late summer 1929 stocks are going ever higher and will continue to go ever higher forever. And so, he loses his reputation after the stock market crash. So, Milton Friedman is stepping into a field in which the greats have been discredited and there's an enormous economic crisis all around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And everybody's struggling to figure out why the crisis happened, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but he says it's generating inequality and this is putting too many strains on the system. So, Knight will become one of the people who helps Friedman think how do I develop a new theory of capitalism that works in an era of mass democracy where people can vote and people can express at the ballot box their unhappiness with what's happening economically. So, this larger movement will generate, of which F.A. Hayek is a part, Friedman is a part that becomes the very early stirrings of trying to think about a new liberalism which will eventually be called neoliberalism.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. So, if we can just linger on the definitions of things. So, we mentioned what neoclassical is and the institutional economics is, what's Keynesian economics? And the Chicago School of Economics, I guess, is a branch of neoclassical that's a little bit more empirical versus maybe model-based and Keynesian is very model heavy, more intervention of government. So, the real battle is Keynesian versus everybody else.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>States, Franklin Roosevelt is not really a Keynesian, he's an accidental or experimental Keynesian and there's a bunch of different ideas in the United States that are very similar to Keynesianism. They're not theorized but there are similar ideas that the government has to do something. So, this all comes together and American economists realize that you can construct models in the Keynesian perspective and, if you can use numbers in these models, you can go to Washington, D.C. with numbers and you seem like you have a lot more authority and so math becomes really twinned into Keynesian economics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, the numbers are used as a symbol of expertise. We really know what the hell is going on because we have some numbers, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the economy as a whole. And in this paradigm of the economy as a whole, the federal budget, the taxing and spending power of the federal government become paramount and that is called the fiscal revolution and that's really the essence of Keynesianism. But the key thing to remember is that Keynesianism and Keynes are different and there's this famous episode where John Maynard Keynes comes to D.C. and he goes to dinner and he comes back and he says to one of his friends in London, he said, \"Yeah, it was really interesting, I was the only non-Keynesian there.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Keynesianism is more government intervention, fiscal policy, so put the government at the center of influencing the economy. And then the different flavors of whether it's Austrian Economics or Chicago School of Economics is saying, no, we have to put less government intervention and trust the market more. And the formulation of that for Milton Friedman is trust the money more, not trust but the money supply is the thing that should be focused on.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. So, the Austrians and the Chicago School see economic prosperity and growth comes from individual initiative, individual entrepreneurship, private sources. The private market is what drives economic growth, not the public sector. And so, for Friedman then the question is what is the government's role. And because he's lived through the Great Depression, he's not laissez-faire and he won't ever be laissez-faire. Now, interestingly, Hayek, living through the Great Depression, at first is laissez-faire and he's like, \"Sure, let it rip.\" And things get so bad that Hayek's like, \"Okay, that's not going to work.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we actually define laissez-faire? So, what do we mean? What's the free market? What's laissez-faire? What's the extreme version here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work and to start the machine again. So, the theory would be, if you give people relief, they might not go back to work. Now, almost nobody says that in the Great Depression because the situation is so bad and people are starving on the street and feel, for humanitarian and ethical reasons, it's not okay to say that. The Austrians though at first, Hayek and Lionel Robbins are like, \"This is a business cycle and it needs to run its course and it will be detrimental if we intervene,\" and then pretty soon Hayek has to change his tune.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, the Austrians are the most hard core in terms of laissez-faire, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. And so, Hayek will make the turn towards accepting more of a state and then will come to talk about how the state needs to support what he calls a competitive order. But his mentor Ludwig von Mises still remains very hard core and is not really open to things like unemployment insurance or other state-based interventions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does von Mises say about human suffering that's witnessed in the Great Depression, for example? What are we supposed to, as economists, as humans that define policy, what are we supposed to see when people are suffering at scale?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the rottenness out of the system, people will live a healthier life. And certainly, there were members of the Federal Reserve who felt like it would create, they didn't say moral hazard, but it would create what we now call moral hazard, bad habits. Were we to intervene and to save failing banks because failing banks need to be taught a lesson, whey need to be taught discipline? And so, a lot of people, I think, saw it in the context of discipline, this is discipline and, if you remove the discipline, you'll be taking away something fundamental in society.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Milton Friedman never quite went all the way to laissez-faire?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>alterations between state and market where the Keynesian assumption is things have changed, times have changed, we're in a new dispensation and we need a new relationship. So, Friedman is very, Milton Friedman is very open to doing things differently in a state of emergency. He will have different ideas during World War II than any other time and that's why I argue I think he would have been supportive of at least the first rounds of coronavirus relief because I think he would have put his emergency thinking hat on. So, in that way, he was definitely more flexible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned Hayek. Who is this guy? What's his relationship to Milton Friedman in the space of ideas and in the context of the Great Depression? Can we talk about that a little bit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because he's a hard core libertarian in an age when that's not in the political mainstream or not discussed in the political mainstream and he's just tremendously unpopular particularly in all the educated precincts where Friedman lives. So, Friedman is like an outcast and a pariah for his support of Goldwater. And so, that actually really affects monetarism because people feel that this is now becoming a package deal and so there's a great reluctance to embrace Friedman's- And so there's a great reluctance to embrace Friedman's ideas because it seems like you would then have to embrace his politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's associated with conservatism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>benefits of freedom. And that gets folded into American conservatism, in part because Milton Friedman is such a powerful intellectual figure. And after his advocacy of Goldwater the media realizes this guy's really smart. He has really interesting things to say. He makes great copy, he makes a great guest, and he starts writing a column for Newsweek magazine, which is a very big deal in a much more consolidated media environment. And he's quoted in all the newspapers. And so his public profile really starts to rise right as he's pushing monetarism as an alternative to the Keynesian synthesis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we just linger on what is monetarism? Once again-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Okay, I didn't go into it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. The money supply.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So money is this thing that you can think of it as a notion where people buy and sell stuff, and there's this fascinating complex dynamical system of people contracting with each other in this beautiful way. There's so many pothead questions I want to ask here, about the nature of money. Money is fascinating in that way, and I think for Milton Friedman trusting the flow of money is really important and the signals that pricing and money in general provides is really important.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are hardcore rural populists, who have constituents who think the banks and money power are the problem, who are throwbacks from the frontier days. So Friedman in the beginning has no constituency for this policy. He has no constituency for this analysis. And so just going back to summarize monetarism, it's looking, it's using the quantity theory of money to analyze the macroeconomy. It's proposing a policy of slow and steady growth in the money supply. And then it is arguing that inflationary episodes when they emerge are profoundly driven by changes in the money supply, not by anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And going even up a level as we started, how epic is it to develop this idea, to hold this idea and then to convince the United States of this idea that money matters, that today we believe is mostly correct for now? And so just this idea that goes against the experts and then eventually wins out and drives so much of the economy, the biggest, the most powerful economy in the world. So fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>result in high unemployment. So he says, \"theoretically, you could end up in a situation where you have high inflation and high unemployment. This hasn't been seen,\" but he says, \"theoretically this could happen.\" And then he goes and he says, \"and the government has started expanding the money supply in 1966, so we're going to get a bunch of inflation, and then we're going to get a bunch of unemployment.\" And he estimates about how long it will take. And then he says, \"once this all happens, it will take about 20 years to get back to normal.\" And-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he predicts the stagflation of the 1970s.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Stagflation of the 1970s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 01:19:39] for an economy. Again against the mainstream belief represented by the Phillips Curve.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Britain is going through a very similar burst of spending, burst of inflation. And so Friedman is vindicated in this very profound way, in the way that he himself said would be the ultimate vindication, which is, my theory should predict. So that prediction of stagflation is really the sort of final breakthrough of his ideas and also their importance to policy and to thinking about how we should intervene or not in the economy and what the role of the Federal Reserve is. Because he's saying the Federal Reserve is incredibly powerful. And finally people start to believe him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I don't know if we said, but to make clear stagflation means high unemployment and high inflation, which is a thing like you mentioned, was not seen before and he predicted accurately. And it also disproves the relationship, the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Now I should say the Phillips Curve is still out there. It's been expectations augmented and it is relevant in the short term, but Friedman's warning is still very much apt, that if you get too focused on unemployment you can let inflation out of the bag. And so until very recently, the Federal Reserve's tradition has been focusing on inflation, believing that's fundamental and that will keep unemployment low, rather than trying to lower unemployment at the cost of raising inflation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we go back to Frank Knight and the big picture thing we started with, which is the justification of capitalism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as you mentioned, Milton Friedman searched for a moral justification of capitalism. Frank Knight was a big influence on Milton Friedman and including on this topic of understanding the moral justification of capitalism. I think you spoke about Knight's Case for capitalism was grounded in the idea that the ability to act in the face of uncertainty creates profit. And it should, because taking risks should be rewarded. So this idea that taking risks in the face of uncertainty should create profit, and that becomes a justification, the ethics of capitalism.

But Friedman's in the moment when he's seeing the convergence. And so that's what he's really focused on. So he believes he can justify capitalism through the ethic of freedom. And he also believes that inequality is a problem that can be addressed through specific policies, and it's not a fundamental feature of capitalism. In other words, he doesn't see capitalism as an engine of inequality the way that Frank Knight did and the way that maybe some critics on the left would.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How did he conceive of freedom?

Eventually Pinochet has voted out and it's become a democratic capitalist and very prosperous country. And he thinks that's exactly what's happening in China.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's what he believed. That's what he believed, yeah. I think it's more complicated than that.

But again, that's that core idea of freedom and that core belief that people want freedom and that people are drawn to freedom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to go back to Frank Knight a little bit, he wrote an essay called The Ethics of Competition, he had the metaphor that economic life is a game.

We have not abandoned discretion, but rules are used as a heuristic or a check, and those come out of freedman's thinking. And so it's something... It's really profound, and it was always counterposed to discretion, which Friedman worried would be subject to capture or political corruption. If you had discretion in policymaking or if you had discretion in these very big areas, then people would stop competing against each other in a market and they would turn their attention to getting control of the rules or the rule makers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if there's clear transparent rules, then you're free to play the game.<|eot_id|>"}

And it becomes really important because they see the example of say countries most notably in Latin America where monetary rules weren't followed and different governments played politics with their currencies, and that created huge upheaval and huge social loss, economic loss, just economic disaster.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So my friend, she's a poker player, philosopher of sorts, great human being, she has a podcast called Win-Win that everybody should listen to.

So that goes to all the non-rational factors and all the comparative factors that people have when they think about where they are vis-a-vis other people in society.

You take Ukraine for example, the perception of corruption has a big impact on the economy. You don't want to invest. You're very cautious as a business person. The reality of corruption can be way different than the actual perception.

And so therefore, my theoretical designs really have to be tempered by what I've actually seen happen in history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe we could speak to this tension between how much government intervention is okay for Milton Friedman.

And I think it's always going to be hard to pull off because I think Americans and their elected representatives don't want to provide a universal benefit. They want to provide a targeted benefit because they believe there's a moral component here. And Friedman advanced a policy that was really abstract and really it was devoid of judgment. It was pure and beautiful in that way but utterly impractical.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it really focused on not interfering with the market and the signals that the market provides.

If you provide people with a minimum income, won't that change their incentives to work, et cetera?\" There's a big body of research on this. Most of it seems to show, that one, it's way better than the current benefits cliff where you have to not work to get your benefits. And any incentive impact on working seems to be much lower than would be expected. But I'll let the economists and the social scientists fight that one out and figure it out empirically. Hopefully, we should be able to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's been a bunch of studies. It's interesting even just how you conduct studies like this, how you do these kinds of experiments, especially if you're empirically minded because a lot of the studies I saw is they're pretty small, so how do you make big conclusions about how to run the world, how to run the economies from such small studies? It's all a fascinating experiment of ideas, and it's also inspiring to see individuals and maybe small groups of individuals like the Chicago School of Economics to shake out what we believe and how we run the world.<|eot_id|>"}

I think that's exactly what he did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've also spoken about the fact that the times when he was out in public, there was more of an open battle of ideas where conservatism often had William F.

It seems we're driven much more quickly by moods rather than thought-through ideas.

That was really meaningful to Friedman. I don't know how politically persuasive it is overall. Milei's very intense. He doesn't have the same gifts of salesmanship and setting people at ease that say someone like Ronald Reagan had, but it seems to be that's what his country was calling for right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, he is more chainsaw-less, like warm blanket.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you're generating too much inequality or people are feeling that you're generating too much inequality, sometimes they value that more than they value freedom, and so I think there has to be more of a balance, and it's hard to make such global statements. You have to break them down into what actually do you mean. But again, Milei is coming from a very different context, a very different country that has seen so much upheaval, so much government intervention, so much inflation, so much political turmoil. He's probably thinking about it differently than Friedman was thinking about it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there was, there probably still is, a real threat of hyperinflation. There seems to be a very high level of corruption or the capacity for corruption, so it's a really messy situation.

But he owes credit himself for keeping Reagan from wobbling on this policy and just pushing it through. And he also tells Reagan, very pragmatically, \"You better do this now. You've got a four-year term. Do this in the first two years of your term.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>other thing he really stresses is that a change in a monetary system, it only happens amid great, great crisis.

If we can switch our path to another great mind of the 20th century, Ayn Rand, we talked about some of the similarities here, about them being fighters for freedom and fighters for capitalism.

I mean, it is about as ambitious of an intellectual project as there can be, and that's what really draws people in. Yet at the same time, she's flying in the face of the way human morals and ethics and societies have evolved, and she's not able to single-handedly recreate them the way she wants them to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, she's not doing herself any favors by taking on the words and trying to rebrand them completely writing the virtue of selfishness.

She didn't want to give that up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, people should listen to her public talks. Her whole aura, way of being is provocative, and she's a real powerhouse of an intellectual. So she loves the challenge and just listening to her in itself is just inspiring.

And he says, \"I can't take capitalist outcomes as ethical unto themselves. I can't do it. It doesn't feel right.\" And there's this line where Frank Knight says, \"No one would ever do this.\" And I was like, \"Oh, Frank Knight, you haven't read Ayn Rand yet.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hold me beer.<|eot_id|>"}

She creates the best possible take on success under capitalism, and then she holds that up as an ideal. And I think what's important is that so few people have done that, and she comes at a time when everybody is emphasizing a downsize of capitalism, and she says, \"There's another way to look at it. Here are the good sides of capitalism.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And like you said, she was operating, which I really loved the phrasing of that, in the Mythic Register.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you.\" And that to Rand was the ideal. You're not thinking of other people. You're an island unto yourself. You're focused on your own goals, your own capacities, and you're not doing it to impress other people or to be better than other people or to dominate other people. You're doing it because expressing your inner soul in a way. So that has been very captivating to so many, and the Fountainhead is one of those books we talked about that causes, people read it and they make changes in their life or they feel called to their higher self.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I think there's also the scene where Rourke with the Dean of Architecture at the school that's speaking to what you're saying, I think to me is inspiring. So this is the Dean of Architecture that expels Rourke, and then brings him into a meeting thinking Rourke will plead for a second chance. And the Dean says that, \"Rourke's work is contrary to every principle we have tried to teach you, contrary to all established precedents and traditions of art. Do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously of building that way when and if you are an architect?\" And then in a gangster-like way, Rourke says, \"Yes.\" And then Dean asks, \"My dear fellow, who will let you?\" And Rourke replies, \"That's not the point.

And so it's also really interesting. The Fountainhead is hugely popular in India, which is fascinating, and talk to people about this and they basically say, \"This book comes like a breath of fresh air into a very traditional and conformist culture. And people just latch onto it and they love it, and it gives them that feeling of freedom and possibility that they're hoping for.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, it really is a book, Atlas Shrugged can be a bit of that too, but it's more of the philosophy objectivism and the details and the nuance of that seeps into Atlas Shrugged.

It's some type of acknowledgement of how important she is to them. Time goes on, and romantic feelings develop between Ayn Rand and Nathaniel Branden, who's some 20 years her junior.

Then when Atlas Shrugged comes out, it's panned by reviewers. People absolutely hate this book. And Rand is not Howard Roark. She falls into a deep depression because her masterpiece has been rejected. Then the romantic relationship ends, but the close personal relationship continues. And then over time Branden, who's still married to his wife, begins an affair with another young woman. At this point he has started the Nathaniel Branden Institute to teach objectivism.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what I argue in my book is actually this is to the benefit of Rand's ideas, because Rand herself was so controlling over her ideas. And now that she steps back from a public role, objectivism flows into the student libertarian movement. Some objectivists become conservatives. It just spreads out more generally, and you don't have to drink the Kool-Aid. You don't have to take the official course. Nathaniel Branden goes on to be part of the self-esteem movement, Human Potential Movement, California and Ayn Rand lives another 10 years or so, but she doesn't do major work after that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Since we were talking about some of the all...

Was she intending to add that there to be controversial? How we're supposed to read into it? Is it a glimpse into Ayn Rand's sexuality?

I'm almost positive she also knew that like, \"If I put in this kind of taboo-breaking sex scene, that's also going to probably be why people tell their friends about it.\" I think it's a mess. I think all of the gender and sexuality stuff that she states is just a total mess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it also reminds me of another guy related, Friedrich Nietzsche, who had very strong opinions on women and wrote about what women's role in society should be in different power dynamics and relationships and all that kind of stuff when he himself really had trouble getting laid. You have to as to always maybe chuckle or take with a grain of salt the analysis of power dynamics in relationship from these figures which failed in many regards in their own private life.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She's almost an anti-feminist because she then goes on... Someone writes her a letter about like, \"Should there be a female president?\" Or something. This is the beginning of feminism.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about gay people. Yeah, it's hard to make sense of. I want to be charitable.

And it came out in this very tortured set of ideals that she tried to promote. And this lack of ability was probably too painful to introspect and to think about that. So she just tried to rationalize her way through it, and it came out in these very strange theories.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think that Ayn Rand is... Maybe you can correct me, but as far as I can see, never mentioned in the list of great thinkers in history or even the great thinkers of the 20th century or even the great female thinkers of the 20th century.

I think that's part of it, the lack of a legacy and the dislike of what she had to say, and the feeling that she's too detached. Her insights are not insights because they're too idealized rather than being rooted in a theory of human nature that people find plausible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You study and write about history of ideas in the United States over the past 100 plus years.

They've been served in a large military. The United States is stepping out onto the world stage. Everything is bigger. What does it mean to be an individual in that world?

Fascism to me is unleashing more something dark and primal within people, and it's more a permission structure to indulge in that that is normally not there.

Maybe not resentment, but envy towards the have-nots versus the haves. And there's some degree to wish Nazism has the same envy towards some group, resentment towards some group.

There's something primal about us humans where once you're in that state of hate, anyone can direct that hate towards anything. Towards any group, towards any idea, towards anything. We could get caught up in the mass hysteria of the hatred. It's a dangerous thing. You floated the idea, I forget where, of pivoting for your next book towards maybe writing about postmodernism, which is a set of ideas almost the opposite of Ayn Rand's philosophy.

And you're like, \"Is it like the process of discovery?\" You're just taking it all in and seeing what unifying ideas emerge, or maybe special moments that illustrate an idea emerge?<|eot_id|>"}

And so now, I need to start a different chapter. What's her life after the book has been published? And then I look for that. Although I have this very high level structure, it's coming out of the archive, the material I'm finding. And if I'm not finding the material there, I won't cover it in great detail, or if I've decided it's outside my ambit, I'm not going to go into great depth on it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're trying to understand the relationships. It's so fascinating, like reconstruct in a dark room, trying to reconstruct, shine a light on relationships through reading letters. It's interesting.<|eot_id|>"}

So she's really responding in real time and being inspired by what's happening in the mid-1940s in the United States. So then I can take that and run with that and figure out where to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're super passionate about teaching. You mentioned Milton Friedman had a very interesting way of teaching. So how do you think of teaching, teaching history, teaching history of ideas, teaching bright young minds about the past?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is the time for students in college figuring out who they are. Their minds are developing and growing. They can really handle complicated hard ideas. They don't always have the context behind them. So I need to give them the hard ideas and then show them this is kind of the context of what's happening in the world. But really, I'm showing them the landscape. I don't have time to go deep. We have a 10-week quarter giving them a flyover. And then I want them to know how to go deep and know where they want to go deep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do the thing that Milton Friedman did, which is in parallel, [inaudible 03:30:39] books.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Do their own parallel curriculum. Exactly. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What advice would you give in terms of reading about ideas you agree with and reading ideas do you disagree with?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of them? When teaching my students about Oliver Wendell Holmes, his dad wrote a poem about him. He called him the astronaut about how he came from outer space. He seemed like he came from outer space. I'm like, \"This is his dad's view of his son.\" That's how weird of a guy he was. And so I try to find that, keep alert for those funny kind of human touches that these are ultimately just people, people with ideas that they spent enough time polishing up and developing that we still want to read about them 100 years later.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the dramatic formulation of that same question? Do you think there's some ideas that are good and some of that are evil? Do you think we can draw such lines or is it more complicated like the old soul genius in line between good and evil that runs to the heart of every person?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that may be true, but she's also unloosing some of the light forces in terms of reflecting on yourself and trying to be true. But definitely, there are ideas that are dangerous to play with. And there are ideas that I think give license to the darker sides of human nature. But I think you can see that in the historical record. So I think that it's possible to show that. And obviously, there's some places like Germany. They think the ideas are so dangerous, they can't be allowed to circulate. And in some contexts, that may absolutely be true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then still even that, we should take with a grain of salt because perhaps censorship of an idea is more dangerous than an idea. So all of that, that's the beautiful thing about us humans. We are always at tension trying to figure out what ideas are the ones that are going to help humanity flourish. Pothead question, do humans have ideas or do ideas have us? So where do ideas come from? You have Milton Friedman sitting there after Rutger's trying to figure out what he can do about the Great Depression. Do you ever think about this? I sometimes think aliens are actually ideas. They're just kind of travel through human brains and captivate us. And we get all real excited with the monolith in 2001 Space Odyssey, a monolith lands, and everybody gets excited. And somehow this idea just gets everybody to be on the same page, and it reverberates through the community, and then that results in an implementation of some action that results in us figuring out that that idea was actually bad, and we learn new ideas. But it feels like the idea is right in the show.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think in a lot of cases, I think it's true. Keynes has this famous quote like, \"Most men are slaves of some defunct economist.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's funny. That's funny.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>realize that you're carrying a map that's orienting you to the world in a certain way.\" And so I think you have to work really, really hard to have an original idea. And even then, it's not a completely original idea. It's a reworking and a reassembling of ideas others have had. So I definitely think it's possible to create autonomy in the realm of ideas and to be an autonomous consumer of ideas. But I think, on balance, most people are not. And that's fine. They want to have experiences. They want to do other things with their life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Jennifer, thank you so much for this journey through ideas today, and thank you so much for your incredible work. It was really fun and fascinating to talk with you today. Thank you,<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you for listening to this conversation with Jennifer Burns. And now, let me try to reflect on and articulate some things I've been thinking about. If you'd like to submit questions or topics that I can comment on in this way here at the end of episodes, go to lexfridman.com/ama, or contact me for whatever other reason at lexfridman. com/contact. Please allow me to say a few words about my interview with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, now that a few days have passed and I've had the chance to think about the conversation itself, the response, future upcoming conversations, and what it all means for the war in Ukraine, for global geopolitics, and for us humans in general. I've gotten a lot of heartfelt positive words from all sides, including, at least so far, literally everybody who knows me personally inside Ukraine, which includes a lot of soldiers and many high profile figures, some who are supportive of the president, and some who are critical of him. Literally, all private communication has been positive and supportive. This is usually not the case with me. Friends usually will write to me to criticize and to disagree. That's the whole point of friendship, to argue and have fun doing it. There was none of that here, at least so far. So thank you for your support and kind words. It means the world. The most common message was, please keep pushing for peace. I will. But online on the interwebs, I saw a lot of attacks sometimes from swarms of online accounts which, of course, makes me suspicious about the origin of those attacks. One of my friends in Ukraine, who by the way thinks the attacks are all propped out by Ukrainian bot farms, said, \"There's no need to say anything extra. Let the interview stand on its own. Just keep focused on the mission of pushing for peace.\" Basically, he's a Ukrainian version of my other friend, Joe Rogan, who to this day says, \"Don't read the comments.\" This is generally good advice and I try to follow it. But I'm also human being. I wear my heart on my sleeve. And this interview, this war for me is deeply personal. And the level of vitriol, misrepresentation, and lies about the conversation and about me personally was particularly intense and disingenuous. So I thought I would use this opportunity to say a few words, just speak a bit more about how I approach this conversation with President Zelensky and conversations in general. This interview is something I poured my heart and soul into preparing a lot. I've described parts of the preparation process I follow in the outro to the Zelensky conversation. But in general, let me say that I've read a lot, listened to a lot, and had a lot of private conversations with people on the ground. I have many flaws. But being unprepared for this conversation is not one of them. Two low effort attacks got to me a bit, if I'm being honest though I am learning to take it all in stride. First attack is that I'm unprepared, uninformed or naive. I don't give a damn about the trolls, but I want people who listen to me, who support me, who care about my words, to know that this is not the case. It never will be the case for future conversations, especially ones of this importance. I work extremely hard to prepare. Second low effort attack that got to me a bit is that I'm a shill for Zelensky or a shill for Putin. Both accusations were hurled readily and freely by the online mob of all persuasions by the left and the right in the United States and Europe by the pro and the anti-Zelensky people in Ukraine or of Ukrainian origins and by the pro and anti-Putin people in Russia or of Russian origins. As I've said over and over, this is not the case. I will never be the case. I'm a shill for no one. More than that, I just simply refuse to be caught in any one single echo chamber. It's an ongoing battle of course, because social media algorithms and the various dogmatic groups and tribes out there want to pull you in to their warm embrace of belonging. And humans want to belong. But the cost of the path I have chosen is that I will never belong to any one group. In the end, like many of us must, I walk alone. And I try to do my best to do what is right to my independent heart and mind, not what is popular with any one group. My goals for this conversation were twofold. First, give a large platform to President Zelensky to explain his perspective on the war and to do so in a way that brings out the best in who he is as a leader and human being. Second goal was to push for peace, and to give him every opportunity possible to signal that he's ready to make peace, and to provide his vision for what that might look like. And just to be clear, by peace, I mean long-lasting peace that minimizes suffering of people in the region and maximizes the flourishing of humanity in the coming decades. The war in Ukraine has led to over one million casualties and growing every single day. For some people torn apart by loss, tormented, and forced into a state of anger and hate, peace is a dirty word. To them, nothing less than justice must be accepted. I hear this pain. I've seen the bodies and the suffering. It's true. Peace will not bring back your loved ones. But it'll prevent further slaughter of more people, each of whom are someone else's loved ones. So again, the second goal of this conversation was to push for this kind of peace. So how did I approach it? Every conversation is its own puzzle. So let me try to explain my approach for this one. As I've said, I read and listened to a lot of material since February 24th, 2022. There would be many weeks over the past three years where I would spend every day over eight hours a day of focused reading and research. There were several rabbit holes that I consistently returned to and researched. But the most important line of inquiry was always peace talks, not just in this war, but in other wars in modern history. For this specific war, as part of the background prep, I would take notes on every single perspective I could find on every single major diplomatic meeting and negotiation that happened in Ukraine-Russia relations since 1991. There is a lot of material to go through. And there are a lot of perspectives, even on the very 2019 meeting that President Zelensky spoke about in this podcast. Just as a small but important example, Andrii Bogdan was interviewed twice by Dmytro Gordon and gave a deep inside look of the administration of President Zelensky, including that very 2019 meeting. The two interviews are seven and a half hours by the way. And from my interviewer perspective, are a masterclass of interviewing. Andrii Bogdan worked directly with President Zelensky as the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine. He was there for the 2019 face-to-face meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin at the Paris Summit, along with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. This was part of the Normandy Format Peace Talks. In those two interviews, Andrii Bogdan gave a very different perspective on that 2019 meeting than did President Zelensky to me in our conversation, the perspective being that the failure to negotiate a ceasefire and peace was not a simple one-sided story. I don't think this is the right time for me to dive into that data point and be critical. I'm not interested in being critical for the sake of criticism. I am interested once again in productive conversations, critical or otherwise, that push towards peace, the kind I described earlier. This is merely an example of a data point I was collecting in my brain. There are many, many others. But all of it taken together made it clear to me, and I still believe this, that it is indeed very difficult but possible to negotiate long-lasting peace with Vladimir Putin. It's certainly true that Ukraine is best positioned to negotiate from a place of strength. After the invasion of February 24th, 2022, I believe there were three chances where peace was most achievable. First chance was March and April of 2022 with a successful defense of the north. Second chance was the fall of 2022 with the successful counteroffensive in Kherson and Kharkiv. The third chance is now. As he has stated multiple times publicly, Donald Trump is very interested in making peace. It is likely that the US financial support for this war will continue to dwindle. So the leverage and the timing for peace negotiation is now. There is unlikely to be another chance like this for a long time. Just to zoom out on the conversation piece of this, I interviewed Donald Trump and may do so again. I interviewed Volodymyr Zelensky and may do so again. And it seems likely that I will interview Vladimir Putin in Russia in the Kremlin. I understand the risks and accept them. The risks for me are not important. I'm not important. I merely want to do my small part in pushing for peace in a moment in history when there's a real chance for that piece to actually be achieved. I may be speaking too long, I'm sorry, but I can probably speak for many more hours. So this is in fact me trying to be brief. So again, my two goals were to bring out the best in the President Zelensky as a leader and a human being, and to give him every opportunity possible to signal that he's ready to make peace and to lay out his vision for what that piece might look like. Like I said, step one through 10 is prepare well. I did. But step 11 is the actual conversation. They're the specific psychological and personality quirks and qualities of the guests matter a lot. My job is to try to cut through the bullshit walls we put up as human beings and reveal directly or indirectly who the person truly is and how they think. With Zelensky, he is a deeply empathic and emotional human who personally feels the suffering of the people of Ukraine in this war. This is a strength and perhaps also a weakness, but it is an important part of the reason why I said many times that he is a truly historic figure. Very few leaders in recent history would be able to pull off what he did, to stay in Kiev, to unite the country, to convince the west to join the war effort to the degree they did. He is also a showman. To borrow the title of the biography, I recommended a man with many layers of humor and wit, but also ego and temper, sometimes fully self-aware and sometimes losing himself in the emotional rollercoaster of a painful memory or a turn of phrase that he can use as a springboard for a angry soliloquy. Add to this, the fact that we didn't agree to anything, what we will talk about or how long we will talk about it. The interview could have easily been five minutes or three hours. So I had to quickly gain his trust enough to open up and stay for a long-form conversation, but push him enough to reveal the complexities of his thought process and his situation. This is where humor and camaraderie was essential. And I would return to it often though it was very difficult given the stakes, the heaviness, the seriousness of the topic of the war. So in this case, the approach I followed for this conversation is constant nudges and questions about peace, often using almost childlike statements or questions. I generally like these kinds of questions. On the surface, they may seem naive, but they're not. They are often profound in their simplicity, like a lot of questions that children ask. Remember, it was a child who pointed out that the emperor was not wearing any clothes. I like the simplicity, the purity, the boldness of such questions to cut through the bullshit to the truth. And that truth is that hundreds of thousands of people died in this war and are dying every day, and all the other problems from corruption, to suspended elections, to censorship cannot be solved until peace is made. I give the president every single chance to signal willingness to negotiate, knowing that both Trump and Putin will listen to this conversation. I don't think he took it and, instead, chose to speak very crude words towards Vladimir Putin. This is fully understandable, but not directly productive to negotiation. To clarify, I have hosted many conversations that were intensely critical of Vladimir Putin from Serhii Plokhy to Stephen Kotkin. But this conversation is with a world leader speaking about another world leader during a opportunity for peace. Crude words of disrespect while powerful may harm negotiations. Peacemaking in this situation requires compromise in order to avoid further death and suffering. And I believe it requires treating the other leader with the seriousness you expect him to treat you with. This is what I was pushing for, all that while also putting my ego aside and letting the president shine, which is necessary to accomplish both goals one and two that I mentioned previously. This is also why I wanted the president to speak about Elon and Trump to extend the olive branch for further avenues of peacemaking. This is not about politics. It is once again simply about peace. Now, all of this, my words, my attempts were taken out of context and used to attack me by some online mobs. As an example, President Zelensky said in a mocking tone that he thinks that Vladimir Putin is simply irritated by people who are alive in Ukraine. And I answered, quote, \"If you believe this, it will be very difficult to negotiate.\" If you think that the president of a country is completely crazy, it is really hard to come to an agreement with him. You have to look at him as a serious person who loves his country and loves the people in this country,. And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions. The president interrupted me at this point and said, \"Who are you talking about now? Who loves this country?\" And I said, \"Putin. Do you think he doesn't love this country?\"And the President answered, \"No.\" Again, this is not a podcast conversation with a historian or activist. And I somehow out of nowhere, just for fun, [inaudible 03:52:38] poetic about Putin's or Zelensky's or Trump's love of nation. It is a conversation with a world leader discussing the opportunity to negotiate peace when a large number of people are dying every single day. Even if the hard ball's over with hate, leadership now requires sitting at the negotiation table and compromising. This may be painful, but it is necessary. There are a few other places in the conversation where some online mobs took my words out of context and used them to call me naive and to call for more war, saying peace is impossible with a man who they claim is the second coming of Hitler. My friends, if you make such attacks on this conversation, it is in fact you who are naive and ignorant of the facts of history and geopolitics. Peace must be made now in order for death and suffering to stop, in order for Ukraine to have a chance to flourish, and in order for the drums of a global war to stop beating, a global war that would cripple humanity. This was my goal once again to push for peace. And I will continue this effort to the best of my ability. Thank you. I love you all.<|eot_id|>"}
