He has admitted guilt to all of it. He has written true-crime stories of many of his fellow prisoners. And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals about their crimes on his YouTube channel that I recommend called Inside True Crime. Exploring the mind of a criminal is exploring human nature at the extremes, often in its most raw and illuminating form. And that is something I definitely want to do with this podcast to understand the human mind and everything it is capable of. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Matthew Cox. What was the first crime you committed?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for. To borrow a mortgage from Bank of America, that's the guy they're looking for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to commit fraud in this space, you have to misrepresent some aspect of your identity, of how much you're worth, how much money you have, this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of it. And my manager is the person that told me to do it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So my concern was they were going to catch it and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid. I needed that money so bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we'll maybe paint the picture here. Where were you working? Who was the manager?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what do I do?\" And I remember she pulled out a thing, a whiteout. Remember a whiteout? Not that it sticks, but the one that...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stuck it in the file. And I mean, like I said, for four or five days, I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm so scared.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How old were you at this point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>started in the mortgage industry. And she was like, \"You have to do this. You were born to do this. This is perfect for you.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did she see in you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sales. It's putting together deals. You're good at that. You're good at negotiating. You're a natural salesman.\" And I figured I need to try something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making, what aspects require the charisma that you clearly have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the more you start to realize that they're...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the borrower some money, they stick it in the bank or they put it in Escrow, the closing company.

So how did it start to evolve from the whiteout?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>very quickly it was changing W-2s, changing pay stubs, changing appraisals, fixing, like I said, verifications of rent.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's what I told myself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Giving them a chance.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>corner, they don't know where to go. And the truth is that I'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with those underwriting guidelines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in this whole process, how are you making money? Are you taking a percentage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a $3,500 broker fee, now I'm making $5,500. So on even a $100,000 loan, you could make a nice chunk of change. I mean, it's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how much gray area is here? You said that there really isn't when you're lying or not, but it feels like there is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>entire...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly, doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As part of this, you did a lot of fascinating things.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the tax ID number didn't match.\" And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number for whatever corporation issued it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a sequence of checks they do to detect fraud in different documents like W-2s?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you're slowly learning-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the process for detecting-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, I had a pretty good understanding anyway, but so I'm starting to learn that-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's common sense understanding. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical? It's unethical in that it's messing with the system on which a lot of people rely, but it feels like there's some aspect of the system that's broken in that it doesn't give people like her a second chance.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>instance, she wasn't getting an apartment with her bad credit, she wasn't getting her utilities turned on.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's extremely hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the shortcut is often going to be illegal.<|eot_id|>"}

This stuff was right through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so birth certificate gets you a Social Security number.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some part is fake, some part is real sometimes, and sometimes it's completely all fake.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was like, \"Oh my God, this is amazing.\" Sure enough, a month later, the other ones I had started, all of them, bam, bam, bam.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what do you do with a phantom borrower?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>could go to an FDIC insured bank, which borrows money. The personal loans they lend out at the max $15,000.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>really good, you could get up to 80 or 100,000 in credit cards and personal loans if you really knew what you were doing. But-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Per person, per identity?<|eot_id|>"}

So how does that work with the mortgage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>parking lot and I'd sign all the documents and I'd wait an hour or two and I'd come back in and say, \"Here you go.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How were you able to keep all of this in your mind because you have to not slip up in any of these conversations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's pretty easy for me to keep everything in the correct category. Does that make sense?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, keep in mind, the appraiser almost never meets the borrower. Never. 99.99% of the time they never meet them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you have to talk about them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I guess what I'm asking is you're able to converse fluently about these synthetic identities.<|eot_id|>"}
