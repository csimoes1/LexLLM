He has admitted guilt to all of it. He has written true-crime stories of many of his fellow prisoners. And now he continues this work by interviewing criminals about their crimes on his YouTube channel that I recommend called Inside True Crime. Exploring the mind of a criminal is exploring human nature at the extremes, often in its most raw and illuminating form. And that is something I definitely want to do with this podcast to understand the human mind and everything it is capable of. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The first mortgage I ever did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A mortgage is me borrowing money from a bank to buy a house.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How can you find a way to commit crime in this? How can you do fraud in this space?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>been in your bank?\" You can't even have it put in your bank for a day, get a letter. It's got to have been there for 90 days or 60 days, depending on the bank. And so there's all these ways... For the average person, it's very difficult to commit fraud. The average guy that works at Walmart and makes $60,000 a year, and he's been there for five years and he saved his deposit, that's really the guy that those transactions are set up for. To borrow a mortgage from Bank of America, that's the guy they're looking for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to commit fraud in this space, you have to misrepresent some aspect of your identity, of how much you're worth, how much money you have, this kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>years. Now, you could be at three places in two years. That's fine. As long as you consistently paid for two years. Well, she had been in an apartment complex, but she'd been 30 days late. Now she caught it up, but she was late. The bank doesn't want to lend you money if you've been 30 days late. So I was a broker and I whited out the 30-day late. I just got rid of it. And my manager is the person that told me to do it. She said, \"It'll be fine.\" And she was right, it was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did it feel like? So that was the first fraudulent action you committed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'd gone deep, deep behind on all my bills to do this. So in the last minute when this loan isn't going to close and I have to commit fraud to make that happen... And my fear was they were going to figure it out and maybe I'd get fired. I didn't think I was going to go to jail because my manager assured me, \"You're not going to jail. You'll get fired at best.\" So my concern was they were going to catch it and I get fired and I wouldn't get paid. I needed that money so bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we'll maybe paint the picture here. Where were you working? Who was the manager?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I put the file in front of my manager, she looks through everything. \"Oh, great. Good. Good.\" And put this one piece of paper over here and sat there. And then when she was done, I said, \"What's going on?\" She goes, \"Perfect. File's perfect.\" She goes, \"But your borrower was 30 days late on her rent,\" and she says it's done. She's like, \"That's a deal killer.\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh, what do I do?\" And I remember she pulled out a thing, a whiteout. Remember a whiteout? Not that it sticks, but the one that...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I could go to jail.\" And she was like, \"They're never going to catch it.\" She said, \"Look, I do stuff all the time.\" She said, \"They're not going to catch it, and nobody's calling the FBI.\" She goes, \"Worst case scenario, if underwriting catches it, then they'll fire you. That's it. Nobody's calling... You're not going to jail.\" And I trusted her. I was like, \"Okay.\" And so I did what she said. I stuck it in the file. And I mean, like I said, for four or five days, I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm so scared.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How old were you at this point?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>things had not worked out. I got a degree in fine arts. There's not a lot of people looking for anyone with a fine arts degree. And I tried to be an insurance adjuster. Tried that for about a year, year and a half, that didn't work out. Ended up working construction for a few years. And so finally the girl I was dating said, \"You got to be a mortgage broker.\" She's had just started in the mortgage industry. And she was like, \"You have to do this. You were born to do this. This is perfect for you.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did she see in you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She said, \"You're a salesman.\" Because I was like, \"I can barely balanced my checkbook. I don't know anything about numbers.\" And she was like, \"It has nothing to do with that. It's sales. It's putting together deals. You're good at that. You're good at negotiating. You're a natural salesman.\" And I figured I need to try something.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what aspect of mortgages is sales and deal making, what aspects require the charisma that you clearly have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to the real estate agent and say, \"Listen, I need you to raise the purchase price and have the seller pay the closing costs,\" which is legal to a degree, but that's not how they wrote up the contract. So now you're having to get them to rewrite the contract or there's little things you're trying to do. And the more deals you get done, and the more you deal with certain real estate agents, the more you start to realize that they're... You know which ones are completely above board and which ones are willing to twist the rules.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And a lot of it works on personal relationships.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for so many people, but people naturally seem to trust me. And so if I say, \"Hey, I can close the loan, but you got to do this. It'll be cool. Don't worry, we do it all the time,\" it's like my third loan and \"I've been doing this for years.\" And they go, \"Oh, okay.\" And then they raise the purchase price, they add some money, they have the seller of the house give the borrower some money, they stick it in the bank or they put it in Escrow, the closing company. Now you're starting to massage deals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the second time you committed a crime? So how did it start to evolve from the whiteout?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that comes in... I mean, I got very, very quickly... I was concerned, \"Do you have a house? Do you have a deal? Is it ready? I can get you done.\" Now, if you were in bankruptcy or something, there's some things you just... You'd pull their credit and you just couldn't help them. If they had a 550 credit score or something and no job. I mean, it had to be within reason, but very quickly it was changing W-2s, changing pay stubs, changing appraisals, fixing, like I said, verifications of rent. So it evolved very quickly for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're essentially helping people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's what I told myself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Giving them a chance. People that have been really struggling financially in life. So you've been telling yourself that you're doing a good thing for people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this, I remember thinking, \"Oh, that's a horrible thing to say.\" Some people should not own a house. They shouldn't be allowed to borrow. They're not in a position financially. And there were many occasions where I put someone in a house that they 100% swore they could afford. I was helping them. I told myself I was helping them, and a year and a half later, they're going into foreclosure. Their stuff's on the corner, they don't know where to go. And the truth is that I'm not smarter than the actuaries that came up with those underwriting guidelines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in this whole process, how are you making money? Are you taking a percentage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interest rate is 8% interest. If I charge them 25 basis points over the 8%, so I charge them eight and a quarter, 8.25, then I get 1% of the loan back as a fee. So if I charge them 8.5%, I get two points back. So if it's a $100,000 piece of property and the bank says your interest rate is going to be 8%, and I tell you 8.5 and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker fee, now I'm making $5,500. So on even a $100,000 loan, you could make a nice chunk of change. I mean, it's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how much gray area is here? You said that there really isn't when you're lying or not, but it feels like there is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, every time I change something, it wasn't gray area, I just committed fraud. At this level, you either meet the guidelines or someone has massaged it in such a way that they've committed fraud and that's it. And there's tons of ways where you can commit fraud and they just can't figure it out. Does that make sense? I mean, you've committed fraud and it's like they've looked at the entire... They look at all the documents and they double check everything, and they know there's fraud in here and they just can't find it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just because they can't find it doesn't mean it's not fraud.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly, doesn't mean it wasn't fraud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As part of this, you did a lot of fascinating things. One of the things you did, you talked about creating synthetic people, meaning creating fake identities. What does it take to do that well?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you're talking to the owners of the lending institutions and the banks, and you're talking to all of the account executives. And now, it wasn't just Eagle Lending I was talking to, there were 40 different account executives coming in on a weekly basis trying to get us to sign up with their lender. And they're on the inside coming in, showing you programs and saying, \"Look, if your borrower is self-employed, we don't ask for this or this, we just ask for them to say to say they're self- employed.\" Liar loans. You've heard the term liar loans?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay. Or no doc loans where they don't ask for any documentation. If he's got over, let's say, a 700 credit score and he says he's been a plumber and he works for himself, and he's got over a 700 credit score, he just has to say he's worked for himself for over two years, and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They don't ask any other questions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Listen, we caught a fake W-2.\" I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" \"Yeah, your broker so-and-so sent us a file and this person had... There's two fake W-2s and we're assuming the pay stubs are fake.\" And I'm like, \"Are you serious? How did you even catch that?\" And they go, \"Oh, well, here's what we did. We checked with sunbiz.gov,\" which is the Secretary of State's website that registers corporations. \"And we checked, and the tax ID number didn't match.\" And now I know every W-2 has to have a matching tax ID number for whatever corporation issued it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a sequence of checks they do to detect fraud in different documents like W-2s?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you're slowly learning-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the process for detecting-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, I had a pretty good understanding anyway, but so I'm starting to learn that-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's common sense understanding. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>applied there using my son's Social Security number,\" let's say. So she started filling those out, and sure enough, she got a credit card and then she got two, and then she got a pre-approval from Ford Motor Credit. She went and got herself a new car, got approved. She'd been making the payments ever since. She has a 750 credit score. She thought she'd try her hand at buying a house in his Social Security number, and we caught it and she got a house in that name. We closed it. I just was like, \"Wow, this is great.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I ask you a question about that? Because it seems like she's able to pay for everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So while this is highly illegal, is it unethical? It's unethical in that it's messing with the system on which a lot of people rely, but it feels like there's some aspect of the system that's broken in that it doesn't give people like her a second chance.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She could have claimed bankruptcy and then two years later... Listen, two years out of bankruptcy, you can go into Bank of America and get a conventional mortgage, assuming you have perfect credit outside the bankruptcy, you have the down payment, you make enough money, there's a whole bunch of underwriting guidelines you have to meet. But that's possible. But you're right. For instance, she wasn't getting an apartment with her bad credit, she wasn't getting her utilities turned on. She wasn't getting any of those things done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So getting your life back on track is just harder.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's extremely hard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a temptation to take the shortcut and the shortcut is often going to be illegal.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you... When I started getting driver's licenses issued by the state DMV, I figured out eventually it was easier to just go into the DMV and have them give me a driver's license than actually make one. But you notice they would just grab the thing, they'd feel the form and go, \"Okay,\" they don't even look at it, which is upsetting if you put as much work into these documents as I am for them to go, \"Okay. Yeah, that's good. Sit over there.\" I felt like going like, \"Hey, bro, take a look at this. This is artwork.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But they're looking for the low hanging fruit of crappy fraud?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Yeah. This stuff was right through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so birth certificate gets you a Social Security number. So it's interesting because you've done a lot of different approaches to creating synthetic people. There's homeless people involved. So sometimes it's grounded in real people or real names.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Some part is fake, some part is real sometimes, and sometimes it's completely all fake.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>synthetic identities. So at least I would have these synthetic identities and maybe I could do something with them. But what happened was at six months, I went and I randomly pulled the person's credit, and he had 705 credit scores, 705, 701, 695. I was like, \"Oh, my God.\" You only needed a 620 to get a 95% loan from the bank. So- Borrow to get a 95% loan from the bank. So I was like, \"Oh my God, this is amazing.\" Sure enough, a month later, the other ones I had started, all of them, bam, bam, bam.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what do you do with a phantom borrower? How do you make money on this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I think most people, if you were just a scammer or a fraudster, you would probably just get credit cards and maybe build up that history or maybe try and borrow a personal loan, which is limited. Personal loans used to be, you could go to an FDIC insured bank, which borrows money. The personal loans they lend out at the max $15,000. So you could do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you can go through this whole process of creating a fake identity, getting a card, paying it off, building up credit, and then you get $15,000 at the end or so.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>7,500. There was a $7,500 from Citibank, $5,500 from American General. So you maybe get, what? 25,000, maybe 30,000 in personal loans. Maybe you could then get another 20 or 30,000 in regular credit cards. 10,000 here, 8,000, 5,000, and then you go to the lower department store cards and you go to Home Depot, you get 1,000, you get 500. So it ends up being maybe you can get 50, 60,000, maybe if you really good, you could get up to 80 or 100,000 in credit cards and personal loans if you really knew what you were doing. But-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Per person, per identity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Per identity. But I had the ability to leverage those perfect credit profiles against properties, and I mean, ultimately that's what I end up doing so each one of those identities was worth a few million.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain how that works, so to leverage them against property? So how does that work with the mortgage?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>my borrower, he's at work right now. He can't make it. Can I just take the file and I'll have him sign all the documents at his work and I'll bring them back. He's like an hour and a half away from here. I'll be back in two or three hours.\" And they're like, \"Oh, wow, man, Matt, thank you so much\". And they would give it to me and I'd go sit in the parking lot and I'd sign all the documents and I'd wait an hour or two and I'd come back in and say, \"Here you go.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How were you able to keep all of this in your mind because you have to not slip up in any of these conversations?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm not great at a lot of things, but this I was very good at.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's these phantom people that exist and they were becoming real people in your mind, as in you're able to tell good stories with those people, right? Because if you're talking to the appraiser, you're talking to everybody involved.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, keep in mind, the appraiser almost never meets the borrower. Never. 99.99% of the time they never meet them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you have to talk about them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I guess what I'm asking is you're able to converse fluently about these synthetic identities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. They all had different jobs. They were all on the job for five years. A lot of it was-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sure. There's a template.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>because I'm walking in saying, \"I got a slam dunk deal for you.\" And they're like, \" Oh, wow, Matt, you got the W-2s, the pay stubs. You got all their rental history, you have everything done. It's perfect. Thank you so much.\" They're happy to do it. \"Hey, I'll print up the docs and I'll have them go sign it.\" \"Great. Wow, thank you.\" Assuming they didn't already know about it, and almost everybody involved in this by the time I was done, was involved. There was probably 15 or 20 people that all knew what was going on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The full of it? They knew the full depth of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Maybe not 100% everything, but they definitely knew this is fraud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they were still going along with it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as well just foreclose. Stop writing us letters and take the houses back.\" And that's all they're looking for, is a reason. At this point, even if they look into Brandon Green, they can't figure out if he's a real person or not because he's got a social security number and everything went bad at the same time. He's got multiple rental properties or his primary residence, all of his credit cards went bad, everything went bad. We have an excuse. We have a letter. That happens. People get divorced, they lose their job, they get in accidents. It's reasonable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When they look into it, it all looks legitimate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Even if they ordered another appraisal, by this point it's not four comparable sales or three or four comparable sales, by this point it's 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 because I kept making more and more of these guys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was your, just almost like a tangent, what's your thinking process? There's a lot of cleverness going on here. So the car pile up as a solution. The newspaper and you mail it. Are you sitting there alone and thinking through this? How do you come up with that idea?

The point is I go to three separate title companies or real estate attorneys, and we close, and I get checks, after cost and everything the total ends up being roughly 400,000. So I've got 400,000. Becky and I run another scam in Tallahassee, Florida, and we get like 50 grand, plus the '80s dwindled down to close to nothing. Because we had gone on several vacations. We went to Bermuda, and I think we went to Jamaica. We actually stayed at the Ritz in Jamaica. So it was very nice.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You and Becky.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, she was useless. She was horrible, and she just spent money all the time.

She smokes pot all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did that matter for you personally or did it actually affect how good you were able to do these particular scams?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, Becky's a problem. And at some point, actually, we send her to a psychiatrist, and they put her on Zoloft.

Oh my God!\" And I'm like, oh my God. And I remember thinking I shouldn't have left her the keys.

I appreciate it.\" I said, okay. I said, \"Hey, by the way, how'd you get my number? This is my cell number.\" And she's like, \"Oh, I'm sorry. We called the title company, and the title company gave us your phone number.\" Well, I closed those loans. That's my cell. That's why if they looked in any other way, they could have gotten in touch with the real Michael Shanahan. So I was like, oh, okay.

And keep in mind, a week or so later, the Secret Service shows up. Did you cash a check for $29,000? So what's so funny is that was one of the last checks we cashed. So we ended up with like 400,000.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Was there a connection between the Secret Service and this guy?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So the FBI is looking for me kind of in Tampa, and they've put out a fugitive warrant for me, which is how the US Marshals got involved.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the US Marshals track down fugitives.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, federal fugitives, they track down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But everybody's after you. You're on every list.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. I'm on the FBI's most wanted list. At that point, the Secret Service got involved once I leave Atlanta. So when Becky and I pack up our bags and we leave Atlanta, the Secret Service got involved because of identity theft, banking, identity theft. The Secret Service doesn't just do counterfeiting and protect the president. They also protect the financial infrastructure of the United States, and they especially have jurisdiction when identity theft is involved.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So identity theft plus bank fraud there, that's when they [inaudible 02:57:33]<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. The US Marshals are, let's say, an arm of all of the various law enforcement agencies. Federal agencies, not the states.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everybody's after me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you know this at that time? Or did you ever sense it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. I mean now every day you're just looking your name up every day. I'm not, because I'm just trying to get a bunch of money and just blend in, right? Things were not as interconnected at that time as they are now, but they're starting to get interconnected. But of course, I have no idea how much. I barely go on the internet for anything. Dating. That's the only thing on the internet. I had never been on Facebook. At this point, Facebook isn't even out yet. This is 2006.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Still, were you trying to stay low?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mean, it's always something nondescript. And I'm living in areas that these cars are everywhere. So I end up going to Charlotte, North Carolina. We rent an apartment, we decide to run a scam in South Carolina, so I go to Columbia, South Carolina. And in between this period of time, we go to Las Vegas. We go to Las Vegas to drop off a bunch of money to Becky's son's father, who's taking care of her son. We drop off some money there we go, and we start... And while we're there, it's like, \"Hey, there's homeless people here.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're always-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know, usually I don't feel bad telling these stories. You make me feel bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my judgment is showing. No, but you have to be collecting identities, I guess, to be constantly creating new identities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>end up coming back and saying yes, we'll do it. I have two closings. One of them is a house that's worth like 225,000. I put down 25 grand. Another one's 110,000. I put down 11,000. So I buy these two houses. I then satisfy the loans on both the houses. Everything seems like it's going okay, although Becky's a lunatic at this point. She won't take her medication. She's had so many outbursts. And by this time we've had plastic surgery. She's gotten plastic surgery, she's gotten a boob job, she's gotten liposuction. I mean, all kinds of stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Look quite different? Like appearance changes or?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they also had mortgages. So there's something called a wraparound mortgage. So these guys did wraparound mortgages. So let's say you buy a house for $250,000 and the bank lends you 200,000, and then you owner finance the house to me. So I give you 50 grand down, but I'm not able to get a loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage. So what we do is you do a wraparound mortgage. So I'll pay you your mortgage and you pay the bank. So there is a second mortgage on the property, but it's wrapped around your first.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's legal?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. I wouldn't lie to you. So these have wraparound mortgages. So-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're always selling, and you're good at it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I go, I satisfy the owner finance loans, the wraparound mortgages, and I satisfy the original loans that these people took out on their own mortgages. One of them, by the way, I sat... You have to sign as the president of the bank, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>up so many banks. The other problem is that these checks, they'll only give you so much money on a refi. Usually after 100,000, they only want to let you walk away with let's say a $100,000. So one of the things I did was I would typically record another mortgage and have them pay that mortgage off. So I opened a corporation to do that, so I could then turn around and go open corporate bank accounts. Because now it's not going off my information, it's going off the corporation, so I can open up multiple corporate bank accounts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, these corporations are fake or real?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no. I went to a real corporate attorney and had him open them. I gave him whatever. I gave him like $1,500, $2,000, and he opened up a corporation for me, Gary Sullivan, and I then turned around and I went and opened up multiple bank accounts in that corporation's name.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How are you keeping track of all this? Is it in your head or do you have good organization?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh no, every single identity has its own file with plastic inlays, sleeves for their passports.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's nice and organized.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For all this. Yeah, it's super organized.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You open this. I'm Gary now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"We still have the problem of these other mortgages.\" And I went, \"Right?\" I said, \"They don't know anything.\" He said, \"I know, but Gary,\" he said, \"what if they find out?\" I said, \"They find out that they're like in second and third and fourth place?\" He's like, \"Right.\" I said, \"I leave town.\" So they both laugh. They go, \"Gary, you can't just leave town. They have a copy of your driver's license. They have your social security number. They have your birth certificate. They'll find you. It's the FBI.\" And I go, \"You're assuming I'm Gary Sullivan.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. You tell them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And listen, they looked at me and they went... And I remember he said, he goes, \"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\" And I said, \"Right, my immediate problem is getting rid of these people.\" And he goes, \"Right. Right.\" So I go get the check, bring it back, give it to them. Never called the FBI.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can't believe you got away with the Washington Mutual.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, bro...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, these are all really close calls, it seems like.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>she's like, \"Okay, I got to go call.\" I said no problem. So the girl walks in the back, I'm sitting there waiting, all of a sudden a massive person reaches over my hand and grabs my wrist, and somebody grabs it from the other one, and they pull my hands behind my back. These are two of possibly the largest law enforcement officers I've ever seen in my entire life. And they're massive. And they handcuff me and they say, \"Mr. Sullivan, you're being detained. We're taking you into custody, and we're holding you until a detective gets here.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Who are these guys? Is this just Marshalls or is this cops or what?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>These are Sheriff's deputies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sheriff's deputies, okay. So Gary Sullivan, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they want us to arrest you.\" He said, \" They're saying that you've got three mortgages on your house.\" And I go, \"Is that illegal?\" And he looked at me and he went, \"You know, to be honest, I don't know.\" And I distinctly remember thinking, I'm walking out of here. All I have to do is convince this guy I haven't done anything wrong. He's already said he doesn't know. So he gets on the phone with the head of Wachovia's fraud department, and he's saying, \"This guy is running what's called a shotgunning scam,\" which is absolutely right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is a shotgunning scam?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and I'll let you know.\" He hangs up. I get up. They've taken the handcuffs off. I stand up. As we're walking out with the detectives, as we're all walking out, he goes, \"Hey, you have an ID. Do you have a driver's license?\" I went, \"I do, but it's in Nevada.\" He goes, \"Oh, that's right.\" He goes, \"You're from Vegas.\" He looks at the two deputies and they all grin. I think he ran me through NCIC, which means he ran a statewide criminal database, which means he thinks I've been arrested three times for prostitution in Vegas.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>get out of this.\" I said, \"The worst that's happens is I'll be arrested as Gary Sullivan. You can get me an attorney. He can get me out.\" She goes, \"I'm not getting you an attorney. I'm not getting you out on bond. I'm not risking everything I've got for you,\" because she has all the money. We've got $700,000, $800,000 at this point. By the way, she's not even in North Carolina at this point. She's relocated to Houston, Texas. Because when this scam fell apart, we were going to move to Texas. So, we were already moving there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But by the way, just a small tangent, where do you store money in situations like this? When you talk about $800,000, do you have to keep moving accounts to make sure it's not accessible by FBI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's about $600,000 or $700,000 accounts, but keep in mind, I'm getting that out in cash. There's no Bitcoin. None of that stuff exists. So, I probably should have bought diamonds or bought gold. I don't know any of that. All I could think of is go in slowly, be patient, don't drain the accounts, fluctuate them. I was getting cashier's checks from one account to another. So, the balances were doing this. They weren't just going ... They were doing this, and then one day, boom, they're gone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, got it.<|eot_id|>"}

I put my cell phone on the counter and just walked out, went downstairs, got in the truck, and drove. When I got to Louisiana, I stopped at Baton Rouge.
