The longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible, by doing interesting stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Joscha Bach, his third time on this podcast. Joscha is one of the most brilliant, and fascinating minds in the world, exploring the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation. He's one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Joscha Bach. You wrote a post about levels of lucidity. \"As we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.\" There are seven of the stages. Stage one, reactive survival (infant). Stage two, personal self (young child). Stage three, social self (adolescence, domesticated adult). Stage four is rational agency (self-direction). Stage five is self-authoring, that's full adult. You've achieved wisdom, but there's two more stages. Stage six is enlightenment, stage seven is transcendence. Can you explain each, or the interesting parts of each of these stages, and what's your sense why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short life?<|eot_id|>"}

Reports of long distance tele telepathy, and remote causation are ubiquitous in the general population. \" I'm not convinced,\" says Joscha Bach, \"that establishing the empirical reality of telepathy would force an update of any part of serious academic physics.

Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds, the representations of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce causal effects through the coordination of the perception and behavioral of world modeling observers.
