{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Jordan Jonas, winner of Alone Season 6, a show where the task is to survive alone in the arctic wilderness longer than anyone else. He is widely considered to be one of, if not the greatest competitors on that show. He has a fascinating life story that took him from a farm in Idaho and hoboing on trains across America to traveling with tribes in Siberia. All that helped make him into a world-class explorer, survivor, hunter, wilderness guide, and most importantly, a great human being with a big heart and a big smile. This was a truly fun and fascinating conversation. Let me also mention that at the end, after the episode, I'll start answering some questions and we'll try to articulate my thinking on some top-of-mind topics. So, if that's of interest to you, keep listening after the episode is over. This is The Lex Fridman Podcast. Support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Jonas. You won Alone Season 6, and I think are still considered to be one of, if not the most successful survivor on that show. So let's go back, let's look at the big picture. Can you tell me about the show Alone? How does it work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a frying pan, some pretty basic stuff. And then, they send them all, drop them off all in the woods with a few cameras. And so, the people are actually alone. There's not a crew or anything, and then you basically live there as long as you can. And so, the person that lasts the longest, once the second place person taps out, they come and get you, and that individual wins. So, it's a pretty legit challenge. They drop you off, helicopter flies out, and you're not going to get your next meal until you make it happen. So...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have to figure out the shelter, you have to figure out the source of food, and then it gets colder and colder because I guess they drop you out in a moment where it's going into the winter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I got in a zone and I felt like I was right back in Siberia or in that head space. And I found, I actually really enjoyed it. I had been a little bit out of, I guess you call it the game, because I had had a child. And so, when we had our daughter, we came back to the States and then a bunch of things happened, and we didn't end up going back to Russia, so it'd been a couple of years that I was just, we were raising the little girl and boy then and then-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you'd gotten a little soft.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was like, \"Did I got a little soft?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have to figure that out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But then it was fun after just some days there I was like, \"Oh man, I feel like I'm at home now.\" And then, it was like you're kind of in that flow state, and it was-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually, there's a few moments when you left the ladder up or with the moose that you kind of screwed up a little bit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you go from that moment of frustration to the moment of acceptance?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I was like, \"Man, that's a lot of calories, but I have to make that happen again now.\" So I kind of went out there and tried that, and that was kind of an attempt at something to, it could have failed or not worked, but sure enough, it worked and the opportunity came again. The moose came wandering along and I was able to get it. But being able to take failure the sooner you can, the better. Accept it and then learn from it, it is kind of a muscle you have to exercise a little bit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's interesting because in this case, the cost of failure is like you're not going to be able to eat.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of our ancestors probably all just dealt with that on a regular basis, but it's something that with all the modern amenities and such, and food security that we don't deal with. And it was interesting to tap into what a kind of peak mental experience that is when you really, really need something to survive, and then it happens. You can't imagine, I mean, that's what all our dopamine and receptors are tuned for that experience in particular. So yeah, it was pretty awesome. But the pressure felt very on. I always felt the pressure of providing or starving.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's the situation when you left the ladder up and you needed fat, and what is it? Wolverine need some of the fat.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this other person is with a moose. So again, kind of the pressure came back to, \"Oh, no, I got to produce again.\" It wasn't the end of the world. And I think they may have exaggerated a little bit how little fat I had left. I still had... A moose has a lot of fat, but it did make me feel like I was at a disadvantage again. And so, yeah, that was pretty intense because those wolverines, they're bold little animals and he was basically saying, \"No, this is my moose.\" And I had to counter his claims.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, they're really, really smart. They figure out a way to get to places really effectively. Wolverines are fascinating in that way. So, let's go to that happy moment, the moose. You are the first and one of the only contestants to have ever killed a moose on the show, a big game animal, with a bow and arrow. So this is day 20, so can you take me through the kill?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was like, \"I don't care if it's a risk, I'm going to build that fence.\" I built it. I would just pick berries and call moose every day. And it was actually really pleasant, just sit in a berry patch and call moose. But then I also had this whole trap and snare line set out everywhere. So I had all these... I was getting rabbits, and when I was actually taking a rabbit out of a snare when I heard a clank because I had set up kind of an alarm system with string and cans. So...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a brilliant idea.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just chose to wait it out, and at one point it stood up and fell over and I could tell it had died. And walked over, you actually touch it and you're just like, \"Whoa. No way.\" That whole burden of weeks of, \"You're going to starve, you're going to starve.\" And it got rid of that demon. To be honest, it's one of the happiest moments of my life. It's really hard to replicate that joy because it was just so real, so directly connected to your needs. It's all so simple. It was a peak experience for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And were you worried that it would take many more hours and it would take it into the night?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I was. Until you actually have your hands on it, I was worried the whole time. It's a pretty nerve wracking period there between when you get it and when you actually recover the animal, get your hands on it. So, it took longer than I wanted, but I finally got it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you actually speak to the kill shot itself, just for people who don't hunt? What it takes to stay calm, to not freak out too much, to wait, but not wait too long?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a tree or you never had a clean shot or whatever it is. And so, every time you can see a moment coming, your heart really starts beating and you have to breathe through it. I can almost feel the nervousness of it. And then, you just try to stay calm. Whatever you do, just try to stay calm, wait for it to come up, draw back. You've practiced shooting a lot, so you have kind of a technique. I am going to go back, touch my face, draw my elbow tight, and then the arrow's going to let loose.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So muscle memory, mostly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not directly towards you, that's what you call quartering towards you. And you can picture, it's actually pretty difficult to hit both lungs because the shoulder blade and all that bone is in the way. So you have to make a perfect shot to get them both. And to be honest, when I took my shot, I was a couple inches or few inches, and so it went through the first lung and then it sunk the arrow all the way into the moose, but it allowed that second lung to stay breathing, which meant the moose stayed alive longer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your relationship with the animal in the situation like that? You said death is a part of life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>exact number and I know what the cost of that is, and I'm aware of it because I'm out in the woods and I see these beautiful elk and moose, and I really love the species, love the animals, but there is a fact that one of those individuals is going to have to feed me. And particularly on Alone, it was very heightened, that experience. So I shot that one animal and I was so, so thankful that I wanted to give that big guy a hug and like, \"Hey, sorry, it was you, but had to be somebody.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's that picture of you just almost hugging it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right? Totally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can also think about it, the calories, the protein, the fat, all of that, that comes from that, that will feed you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. You're so grateful for it. The gratitude is definitely there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the bow and arrow perspective?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it. I will say there's an aspect that is fun. There's no denying it. It's like how people have been hunting forever. And I think it speaks to that part of us somehow. And I think bow hunting is probably the most pure form of it, and that you get those experiences more often than with a rifle. So, I don't know. I enjoy it a lot. And the way they do regulations and such kind of the best times to hunt are usually allowed for bow because they're trying to keep it fair for the animal and such. So...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the distance, the close distance makes you more in touch with sort of the natural way of the predator and prey, and you just-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're one of the predators where you have to be clever, you have to be quiet, you have to be calm, you have to, all of that. And the full challenge and the luck involved in catching that. The same thing as the predators do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly how many times do they snap a stick and watch them run off, and, \"Darn, my stock was failed.\" So yeah, you're in that ecosystem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How'd you learn to shoot the bow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>did and a part of our life that when I came back, I got a bow and I started doing archery in Virginia. It was a pretty easy way to hunt because the deer were overpopulated and you could get these urban archery permits. So you go out and every couple of days you'd have an opportunity to shoot a deer that they needed population control. And so, there were a lot of them, and it gave you a lot of opportunities to learn quickly. So that's what got me into it, and then I found I really enjoyed it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you practice with the target also or just practice out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, no, I would definitely practice with a target a lot. Again, you kind of have an obligation to do your best because you don't want to be flinging arrows into the leg of an animal. And it's a cool way, honestly, to provide quality meat for the family. It's all raised naturally and wild and free until you bring it home into the freezer. So...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if we step back, what are the 10 items you brought and what's actually the challenge of figuring out which items to bring?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The challenge is that you don't exactly know what your site's opportunities are going to be. So, you don't really know, should I bring a fishing net? Am I going to even have a spot to net or not? And things like that. I brought an ax, a saw, a Leatherman wave, ferro rod is like, makes sparks to start a fire, a frying pan, a sleeping bag, a fishing kit, a bow and arrow, trapping wire, and paracord. And so, those are my 10 items.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there any regrets, any-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No major regrets. I took the saw kind of, I thought it would be more of a calorie saver, then I didn't really need it. In hindsight, if I was doing season seven instead of six and got to watch, I would've taken the net because I just planned to make a net, but I would've rather just had two nets, brought one and left the saw. Because in the northern woods in particular, every tree is the size of your arm or leg. You can chop it down with an ax in a-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... couple swings. Yeah, you don't really need the saw. And so, it was handy at times and useful, but I think it was my... If I had to do nine items, that would've been just fine without the saw.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So two nets would just expand your-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Food gathering potentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then, in terms of trapping, you were okay with just the little you brought?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>put a snare, put a little mark on the tree so I knew where that snare was and just make these paths through the woods. And I put out, I don't know how many, 150, 200 snares. So every day I'd get a rabbit or two out of them. And then, so I had a lot of rabbits, but once I got the moose, I actually took all those snares down because I didn't want to catch anything needlessly. And, you come to find out you can't live off of rabbits, man cannot live off rabbit alone it turns out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you set up a huge number of traps. You were also fishing and then always on the lookout for moose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in terms of survival, if you were to do it over again, over and over and over and over, how do you maximize your chance of having enough food to survive for a long time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have to be really adaptable because everything's going to, it's always going to look different, your situation, your location. I actually had what I thought was a pretty good plan going into Alone, and the location didn't allow for what I thought it would.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the plan?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have to unlock the key that is sustainability. And I think there's a lot of areas that still have that potential, but you have to figure out what it is. It's usually going to be a combination of fishing, trapping, and then hunting. And then, once you have the fishing and trapping will get you until you have some success hunting. And then, that'll buy you three or four months of time to continue, and to keep hunting again. And you just have to roll off of that. But it depends on where you are, what opportunities are there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so that's the process. Fishing and trapping until you're successful hunting. And then the successful hunt buys you some more time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You just go year round.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then you just go year round like that. And that's how people did it forever. The pressure, I noticed it with you got that moose and then you're happy for a week or so, and then you start to be like, \"This is finite. I'm going to have to do this again.\" And you imagine if you had a family that was going to starve if you weren't successful this next time. And there's just always that pressure. It made me really appreciate what people had to deal with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, in terms of being active, so you have to do stuff all day. So you get up-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Get up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and planning like, \"What am I going to...\" In the midst of the frustration, you have to figure out what's the strategy, how do you put up all the traps? Is that a decision, like most people sit at their desk and have a calendar, whatever, are you figuring out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them as you see fit as it flows in. And that's actually one of the things that people really, that I really appreciate about that lifestyle is it really is, you're kind of in that flow. And so, I'd wake up and be like, \"Maybe I'll go fishing,\" and then I'd wander over and fish, and then I'd be like, \"I'm going to go check the trap line,\" at every day, if I had five or 10 snares, you're constantly adding to your productive potential, but nothing's really scheduled. You're just kind of flying by the seat of your pants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then there's a lot of instinct that's already loaded.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, there's so much. Yeah,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just wisdom from all the times you've had to do it before that you're just actually operating a lot on instinct, like you said, where to place the shelter, how hard is that calculation, where to place the shelter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a good place.\" But also, \"Is there firewood nearby? And if I'm going to be here for months, is there enough firewood that I'm not going to be walking half a mile to get a dry piece of wood? Is the water nearby? Is it somewhat open but also protected from the elements?\" Sometimes you get a beautiful spot. It is great on a calm day, and then the wind comes like. And so. There's all these factors even down to taking in what game is doing in the area also, and how that relates to where your shelter is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you have to consider where the action will be, and you want to be away from the action, but close enough to it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you want to be, yeah, right. And so, ideally, it depends. You're always going to make give and takes. And one thing with shelters and location selection and stuff, that's another thing. You just have to trust your ability to adapt in that situation because everybody has a particular... You got an idea of a shelter you're going to build, but then you get there and maybe there's a good cliff that you can incorporate, and then you just become creative. And that's a really fun process, too, to just allow your creativity to try to flourish in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What kind of shelters are there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>my particular idea was to keep it fairly simple, improve it with time, but spend most of my energy... The shelter, you really need to think about it can't be smoky because that'll be miserable, but it is nice to have a fire inside. So you need to have a fire inside that's not going to be dangerous, smoke-free, and then also airtight, because you're never going to have a warm shelter out there because you don't have seals and things like that, but as long as the air's not moving through it, you can have a warm enough shelter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>With a fire.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>With a fire and dry your socks and stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you get the smoke out of the shelter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you have good clay and mud and rock, you can build yourself a fireplace, which is surprisingly not that hard. You just-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, really?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it collects and billows back down. So then I cut some of my tarp and made this, and cut a hole in the... Cut some of my tarp and made this... and cut a hole in the A-frame, and then I made a hood vent that I could pull down and catch the smoke with. And so, while the fire was going, it would just billow out the hood vent. And then, when it was done burning and was just hot coals, I could close it, seal it up and keep the heat in. So, it actually worked pretty well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, start with something that works and then keep improving it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I was wondering, the log cabin, it feels like that's a thing that takes a huge amount of work before it'll work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. The difference between a log cabin and a warm log cabin is like an immense amount of work and all the chinking and all the door sealing and the chimney has to be... Anyway, otherwise it's just going to be the same ambient temperature as outside. So, I don't think a loan is the proper context for a log cabin. I think log cabin is great in as a hunting cabin, if you're going to have something for years. But in a three, six-month scenario, I don't know that it's worth the calorie expenditure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it is a lot of calories. But that's an interesting metaphor of just get something that works. You see a lot of this with companies, like successful companies, they get a prototype, get a system that's working and improve fast in response to the conditions to environment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because it's constantly changing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You end up being a lot better if you're able to learn how to respond quickly versus having a big plan that takes a huge amount of time to accomplish. That's interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Forcing that through the pipeline, whether or not it fits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you just speak to the place you were, the Canadian Arctic? It looked cold.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it really did reward activity. But it's a special place. It was Dene, there was a tribe that lived there, the Dene people, which interestingly enough, here's a side note. When I was in Siberia, I floated down this river called the Podkamennaya Tunguska, and you get to this village called Sulamai, and there's these Ket people they're called, and there's only 600 of them left. This is in the middle of Siberia, not unlike the Pacific coast, but their language is related to the Dene people. And so, somehow that connection was there thousands of years ago. Super interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, language travels somehow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. And the remnants stayed back there. It's very interesting to think through history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Within language, it contains a history of a people, and it's interesting how that evolves over time and how wars tell the story. Language tells the story of conflict and conflict shapes language, and we get the result of that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. So, fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the barriers that language creates is also the thing that leads to wars and misunderstandings and all this kind of stuff. It's a fascinating tension. But it got cold there, right? It got real cold.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dress warm. There's a good one. If you're in the cold, never let yourself get too cold, because what happens is you'll stop feeling what's cold and then frostbite and then issues, and then it's really hard to warm back up. So, it was so annoying. I'd be out going to ice fish or something and then I would just notice that my feet are cold and you're just like, \"Oh, dang it.\" I just turn around, go back, start a fire, dry my boots out, make sure my feet are warm, and then go again. I wouldn't ignore that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, so you want to be able to feel the cold?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you want to make sure you're still feeling things and that you're not toughen through it.

There is something that's a little bit life-giving just because you feel on an edge, you're on this edge, but you have to be alert because even some of the natives I lived with, the lady had face issues because she let her head get cold, when they're on a snowmobile hat was up too high, that little mistake, and then it just freezes this part of your forehead and then the nerves go and then you got issues. One just hat wasn't high enough, so you got to be dialed in on stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a psychological element to just... I mean, it's unpleasant.

I wonder if you're born with that or if that's developed maybe your time in Siberia or do you gravitate towards it? I wonder what that is because I really don't like survival in the cold.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think a little bit of it is learned. You almost learned not... you learn not to fear it. You learn to appreciate it. And a big part of that is to be honest, it's like dressing warm, being in good... it's not like, there's no secrets to that. You just can't beat the cold. So, you just need to dress warm, the native, all that fur, all that stuff, and then all of a sudden you have your little refuge, have a nice warm fire going in your teepee, and then I bet you could learn to appreciate it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think some of it is just opening yourself up to the possibility that there's something enjoyable about it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. I do feel that way.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's scary when you haven't done it and you don't know what you're doing and you go out and you feel cold.

Maybe that's a thing that I struggle with is the time passes slower. It does make you feel alive, you get to feel time. But then, the flip side of that is you get to feel every moment and you get to feel alive in every moment. So, it's both scary when you're inexperienced and beautiful when you are experienced.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on day two and then more and more as the time went. So, I actually did pretty well on the food front. The other thing is when you have all those berries around and stuff, you do have an ability to fill your stomach, and so you don't really notice if you're getting thinner or if you're losing weight. So, I can say on Alone, I was not that hungry. I've definitely been really hungry in Russia. There were times when I lost a lot of weight.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>point because it went pretty well. And definitely it was hard psychologically because I didn't know when it was going to end. I thought this could go, like I said, six months, it could go eight months, a year, and then you start to... a two and a three-year-old and you start to weigh in the, \"Is it worth it if it goes a year and it's not worth it if it goes eight months and I still lose?\" So, I feel like I had this pressure and it was psychologically difficult for that reason. Physically, it wasn't too bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is off mic. We're talking about Gordon Ryan competing in Jiu-Jitsu. And maybe that's the challenge he also has to face is to make things look hard.

And then, after that I thought we were just going to push into the... then it's just to see how much who has what reserves and will go as far as we can. And that would get me through January into February.

And once it's in hindsight, that year would've been like that, talking about it. So, I had that perspective. And so, I knew I wasn't going to tap for any other reason other than running out of food someday. So, that was my stressor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you're able to, given the boredom, given them loneliness, zoom out and accept the passing of time, just let it pass?<|eot_id|>"}

There was every day I would think of, \"I got to think of something to make me laugh and then do some stupid skit.\" And then, that would fill a couple hours of my time, and then I'd spend an hour or two, a few hours fishing, and then you'd spend a few hours, whatever you're doing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Would you do that without a camera?<|eot_id|>"}

I'm sure, because even if I had a bunch of food and this and that, but because I knew you... you know you're a part, you're sharing, it gives you a lot of strength to go through and having that camera just makes it that much more vivid because you know you're not just going to be sharing a vague memory, but an actual experience.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think if you're the last person on earth, you would actually convince yourself, first of all, you don't know for sure.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I actually felt really good.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, you can't just live off protein and rabbits are almost just protein. I'd kill a rabbit, eat the innards and the brain and the eyes, and then everything else is just protein. And so, it takes more calories to process that protein than you're getting from it without the fat. So, you actually lose... I had a lot of rabbits in the first 20 days. I had 28 rabbits or something, but I was losing weight at exactly the same speed as everybody else that didn't have anything.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I'd never tried that before.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And you'll notice when the wolverine came or when animals came, they would eat the skin off of the fish.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you don't have a schedule, you literally just have needs and you just somehow have to meet your needs.

And then, you meet a lot of different people and a lot of different kinds of stories. And also, a lot of people that support you for traveling. Because there's a lot of people dream of experiencing that freedom, at least the people I've met. And they usually don't go outside of their little town. They have a thing and they have a family usually, and they don't explore, they don't take the leap. And you can do that when you're young. I guess you could do that at any moment.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was richer than English. It's a very rich language. I remember there was a comedy act in Russian, but he was saying, \"One word you can't have in English is [foreign language 01:17:32],\" meaning I didn't drink enough to get drunk. That type thing. But it's just that you can make up these words using different prefixes, and suffixes, and blend them in a way that is quite unique and interesting. And honestly, would be really good for poetry because it also doesn't have sentence structure in the same way English does. The words can be jumbled in a way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And somehow in the process of jumbling some humor, some musicality comes out. It's interesting. You can be witty in Russian much easier than you can in English, witty and funny. And also with poetry, you can say profound things by messing with words in the order of words, which is hilarious because you had a great conversation with Joe Rogan. And on that program, you talked about how to say I love you in Russian, just hilarious. And it was for me, the first time, I don't know why you were a great person to articulate the flexibility and the power of the Russian language. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because you were saying [foreign language 01:18:40], you could say every single order, every single combination of ordering of those words has the same meaning, but slightly different.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it would change the meaning if you took ya out and just said, [foreign language 01:19:03].

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, exactly.

I've recently become a fan actually of Larissa Volokhonsky and Richard Pervear. They're these world-famous translators of Russian literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekov, Pushkin, Bulgakov, Pasternak. They've helped me understand just how much of an art form translation really is. Some authors do that art more translatable than others, like Dostoevsky is more translatable, but then you can still spend a week on one sentence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just how do I exactly capture this very important sentence? But I think what's more powerful is not literature, but conversation, which is one of the reasons I've been carrying and feeling the responsibility of having conversations with Russian speakers because I can still see the music of it, I can still see the wit of it. And in conversation comes out really interesting kinds of wisdom. When I listen to world leaders that speak Russian speak, and I see the translation, and it loses the irony. In between the words, if you translate them literally, you lose the reference in there to the history of the peoples.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, for sure. And I've definitely seen that on, and if you listen to, I think it probably was a Putin speech or something, and you just see that, \"Oh wow, something major is being lost in translation.\" You can actually see it happen. I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't the case with that whole greatest tragedy as the fall of the Soviet Union that I hear him being quoted as saying all the time. I bet you there's something in there that's being lost in translation that is interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the thing I see the most lost in translation is the humor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'll just say that that was tangibly the hardest part about learning the language is that humor comes last and you have to wait. You have to wait that whole year or however long it takes you to learn the language to be able to start getting the humor. Some of it comes through, but you miss so much nuance and that was really difficult in interaction with people to just be the guy when there's humor going on and you're totally oblivious to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, everybody's laughing and you're like trying to laugh along.

Go to that one, open up all those traps, and then there, and then three weeks later or so, they'll end up back at the first cabin, and then check all the traps. And so, it's that rhythm. And they'll do that for a couple, few months during the winter. And you're trapping sable, they're called sable, like Pine Martin is what we would have the equivalent of over here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is it?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's other thing, I slightly rounded this pole here. It's just a little nuance because when you pound a stake in, if you picture it, if it's convex, when you're pounding it, it's going to blow the fibers apart. If it has just a slight concave, it helps hold the fibers together. And so, it's a little nuance, not too flat because you want to still be able to use the back as you would.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What kind of stuff are you using the axe for?<|eot_id|>"}

Of course, you can use it. I use it if you're taking an animal apart or if you're... All kinds of, what else?

It doesn't hit you, or when you're chopping, like say you're creating something that you're not doing it on rocks and stuff so that you're doing it on top of wood so that when you're hitting the ground, you're not dulling your axe.

Sure enough, there's a stump with a boot upside down, pull it off, put it on. I was like, \"Sweet. I'm back in business.\" I went back a couple of days later, pting, chum, chopped it, cut your foot, cut my rubber boot. And I was just like, \"Dang it.\" And I was mad enough that I just grabbed the axe, and swung it at the tree, and it just one-handed, and deflected off and bam, right into my knee.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh no.<|eot_id|>"}

I was in so much pain and my other knee was bad. It was rough. I literally couldn't even walk at all or move.

And so, if you can find that in a rainstorm, you can just make a little pile of those shavings, get the crappiest spark or quickest light, and it'll sit there and burn like a factory fire starter. It's really, really nice. That's good to spot. It's a good thing to keep your eye out for.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's really fascinating.

And then he was like a month blackout drunk, and now he's sobered up. And now, boom, back into life, back into being a knowledgeable, capable person.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In a way, it's just perfectly naturalist for us to feed that hate and feed that tribalism in group outgroup, \"We're on this team.\" And I think that can happen...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a gradual process, a little bit at a time.<|eot_id|>"}

But we live in a pretty easy, comfortable society. What if you pictured yourself in the position of my grandparents and then, all of a sudden, you got the upper hand in some kind of a fight?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those that persecute you, and just on down the line that something like that rose in the world into a position where we all accept those ideals, I think, is really remarkable and worth appreciating. That said, a lot of that gets wrapped up in what is so natural. It just becomes another instrument for tribalism or another justification for wrong. And so, I even myself, am self-conscious sometimes talking about matters of faith, because I know when I'm talking about something else than what someone else might think of when they hear me talking about it. So, it's interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've been listening to Jordan Peterson talk about this. He has a way of articulating things, which are sometimes hard to understand in the moment, but when I read it carefully afterwards, it starts to make more sense. I've heard him talk about religion and God as a base layer, like a metaphorical substrate from which morality of our sense of what is right and wrong comes from, and just our conceptions of what is beautiful in life, all these kinds of higher things that are fuzzy to understand, that their religion helps create this substrate for which we, as a species, as a civilization, can come up with these notions. And without it, you are lost at sea. I guess for him, morality requires that substrate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>kind of fuzzy. So, I've only been able to get clear vision of it when I live it. It's not something you profess or anything like that. It's something that you take seriously and apply in your life. And when you live it, then there's some clarity there, but that it has to be defined. And that's where you come in with the religion and the stories, because if you leave it completely undefined, I don't really know where you go from there. Actually isn't a funny to speak to that. I did mushroom. Have you ever done those before?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. Mushrooms, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was like, \"Oh, there's Alana and Alta and Zion.\" But then they were bounded, and then once they're bounded, you're subject to the death and to the misunderstanding and to all that. I picture the amoeba or the cell, and then when it dies, it turns into a unformed thing. So, we need some kind of form to relate to. So, instead of always just talking about God completely and tangibly, it gave me a way to relate to it. And I was like, \"Wow, that was really powerful to me,\" and putting it in a context that was applicable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But ultimately, God is the thing that's formless, that is unbounded, but we humans need.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's the purpose of stories.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Can't relate to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We can't relate to it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. And then that was always, a lot of my family and loved ones and friends have completely left the faith. And I totally, in a way, I get it. I understand, but I also really see the baby that's being thrown out with the bathwater. And I want to cherish that, in a way, I guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's interesting that you say that the way to know what's right and wrong is you have to live it. Sometimes, it's probably very difficult to articulate. But in the living of it, do you realize it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>realized, when I struggled with trying, with taking... I actually did try to take it seriously and struggle with what does it mean to live out of life of love in the world? But that's a wrestling match. It's not that simple. It sounds good, but it's really hard to do. And then you realize you can't do it perfectly. But in that struggle, in that wrestling match is where I actually sense that relationship. And then that's where it gains life and how that... and I'm sure that relates to what Jordan Peterson is getting at in his metaphor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the striving of the ideal, in the striving towards the ideal, you discover how to be a better person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have a choice.\" And so, I had to choose at that point to maintain that ideal because I could add enough time on alone. One nice thing is you don't have any distractions. You have all the time in the world to go into your head. And I could play those paths out in my life. And not only in my life, but I feel like societally and generationally. I throw it all away and everybody start from square one, or we can try to redeem what's valuable in this and wrestle with it. And so, I chose that path.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I do think it's like a wrestling match. You mentioned Gulag Archipelago. I'm very much a believer that we all have the capacity for good and evil. And striving for the ideal to be a good human being is not a trivial one. You have to find the right tools for yourself to be able to be the candle, as you mentioned before.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. I like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then for that, religion and faith can help. I'm sure there's other ways, but I think it's grounded in understanding that each human is able to be a really bad person and a really good person. And that's a choice. It's a deliberate choice. And it's a choice that's taken every moment and builds up over time. And the hard part about it's you don't know. You don't always have the clarity using reason to understand what is good and what is right and what is wrong. You have to live it with humility and constantly struggle. Because then, yeah, you might wake up on a society where you're committing genocides and you think you're the good guys. And I think you have to have the courage to realize you're not. It's not always obvious.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It isn't, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>History has the clarity to show who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. You got to wrestle with it.

And our job is to work on that within ourselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the part. That's what I like. The full quote talks about the fact that it moves. The line moves moment by moment, day by day. We have the freedom to move that line. So, it is a very deliberate thing. It's not like you're born this way and it's it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And especially in conditions that are worn peace, in the case of the camps, absurd levels of injustice, in the face of all that, when everything is taken away from you, you still have the choice to be the candle like the grandmas.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Shout-out. Seriously, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know what it is. I don't know. They have this wisdom that comes from patience and have seen it all, have seen all the bullshit of the people that come and gone, all the abuses of power, all of this, I don't know what it is. And they just keep going.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, right. Yeah, that's so true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As we've gotten a bit philosophical, what do you think of Werner Herzog's style of narration? I wish he narrated my life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's amazing to have listened to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because that documentary is actually in Russian. I think he took a longer series and then put narration over it. And that narration can transform a story.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, he does an incredible job with it. Have you seen the full version? Have you watched the four-part full version? You should. You'd like it. It's in Russian, and so you'll get the fullness of that. And he had to fit it into a two-hour format. So, I think what you lose in those extra couple hours is worth watching. I think you'll like it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they always go pretty dark.<|eot_id|>"}

Things must die for things to live, like you said. And that's just played out all the time. And it's indifferent to you, doesn't care if you live or die, and doesn't care how you die or how much pain you go through while you... It's pretty brutal. So it's interesting that he taps into that, and I think it's valuable because it's easy to idealize in a way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the indifference is... I don't know what to make of it. There is an indifference. It's a bit scary, it's a bit lonely. You're just a cog in the machine of nature that doesn't really care about you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Totally. I think that's something I sat with a lot on that show, is another part of the depths of your psychology to delve into. And that's when I thought I understand that deeply, but I could also choose to believe that for some reason it matters, and then I could live like it matters, and then I could see the trajectories. And that was another fork in the road of my path, I guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about the connection to the animals? So in that movie, it's with the dogs. And with you it's the other domesticated, the reindeer. What do you think about that human animal connection?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I think it also puts you in a proper context. One thing I noticed about the natives who live with those animals all the time is they relate to life and death a little more naturally. We feel really removed from it, particularly in urban settings. And I think when you interact with animals, and you have to confront the life and the death of them and the responsibility of a symbiotic relationship you have, I think it opens it a little bit awareness to your place in the puzzle, and puts you in it rather than above it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you been able to accept your own death?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I wonder. You wonder when it actually comes, what you're going to think. But I did have my dad to watch, confronted in as positive a manner as you could. And that's a big advantage. And so I think when the time comes that I will be ready, but I think that's easy to say when the time feels far off. It'll be interesting if you got a cancer diagnosis tomorrow and stage four. It'll be heavy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you ever confront death while in survival situations when you're in?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>see them a little bit and I was like, \"Oh, that's how dad's hands looked.\" They were alive, alive, and then interesting. Are my hands going to look like that and a few minutes or whatever. So then I wrote down to my family what I thought, \"I love you all. I feel at peace,\" blah, blah, blah. And then I passed out and I woke up. But I didn't think... I actually thought, when I went to pass out, I thought there was a coin toss for me. So I really felt like I was confronting the end there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the harshest conditions to survive in on earth?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there are places that are just purely uninhabitable. But I think as far as places that you have a chance-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a chance is a good way to put it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe Greenland. I think of Greenland because I think of those Vikings that settled, there were rugged capable dudes and they didn't make it. But there are Inuit, natives that live up there, but it's a hard life and the population's never grown very big, because you're scraping by up there. And you picture, and the Vikings that did land there, they just weren't able to quite adapt. The fact that they all died out is just a symbol to that must be a pretty difficult place to live.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What would you say? That's primarily because just the food sources are limited.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The food sources are limited, but the fact that some people can live there means it is possible. They've figured out ways to catch seals and do things to survive, but it's by no means easier to be taken for granted or obvious. I think it's probably a harsh place to try to live.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's fascinating not just humans, but to watch how animals have figured out how to survive. I was watching a documentary on polar bears. They just figure out a way, and they've been doing it for generations, and they figure out a way. They travel hundreds of miles to the water to get fat, and they travel 100 miles for whatever other purpose because they want to stay on the ice. I don't know. But there's a process, and they figure it out against the long odds, and some of them don't make it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's incredible. What tough things, man. You just think every animal you see up in the mountains when I'm up in the woods, there's that thing just surviving through the winter, scraping by. It's tough existence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think it would take to break you, let's say mentally? If you're in a survival situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I wouldn't do it. But maybe you're right. Maybe I would think I wasn't. But I think I can't imagine. We're so blessed in the time we live, but I can't imagine what it's like to lose your kids, something like that. It was an experience that was so common for humanity for so much of history. Would I be able to endure that? I would have at least a legacy to look back on of people who did, but god forbid I ever have to delve that deep. You know what I mean? I could see that breaking somebody.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In your own family history, there's people who have survived that, and maybe that would give you hope.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean I think that's what I would have to somehow hold onto.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But in a survival situation, there's very few things that-<|eot_id|>"}

It hadn't pushed my mental limit at all yet I would say or on the scale, but that's not to say there isn't one. I know there is one, but I have a hard time... I know I've dealt with enough pain and enough discomfort in life that I know I can deal with that. I think it gets difficult when there's a way out, and you start to wonder if you shouldn't take the way out as far as if there's no way out, I don't know-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, that's interesting. I mean that is a real difficult battle when there's an exit, when it's easy to quit.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>body, you would be smart to quit. You should just not do that when it's not necessary, because health is kind of all you have in some regards. So I don't blame anyone when they quit because of that reason. It's like good. But if you're in a situation and you don't have the option to quit, is knowing that you're doing permanent, that's not going to break. That won't break me. You just have to get through it. I'm not sure what my mental limit would be outside of the family suffering in the way that I described earlier.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When it's just you, it's you alone. There's the limit. You don't know what the limit is.<|eot_id|>"}

And when they go out of whack, it can be very overwhelming. And they all will at some point. And so that's an interesting thing to think ahead on how you're going to confront it. It does keeps you humble, like you said.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's inspiring that people figure out a way. With migraines, that's a hard one though.

So thanks to him for seeing the higher calling there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote a note on your blog. In 2012, you spent five weeks-ish in the forest alone. I just thought it was interesting, because this is in contrast to on the show Alone, you are really alone, you're not talking to anybody. And you realize that, you write, \"I remember at one point, after several weeks had passed, I wondered into a particular beautiful part of the woods and exclaimed out loud, 'Wow.' It struck me that it was the first time I had heard my own voice in several weeks, with no one to talk to.\" Did your thoughts go into some deep place?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with the random dude you didn't say thank you to and the issue that you didn't resolve. All this stuff that was long gone will come up, and then you'll work through it, and you'll think how you should make it right. I had a lot of those thoughts while I was out there, and it was so interesting to see what you would just brush over and confront it. Because in our modern world, when you're always distracted, you're just never ever going to know until you take the time to be alone for a considerable amount of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Spend time hanging out with the skeletons?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. I recommend it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you said you guide people. What are your favorite places to go to?<|eot_id|>"}

It might be a YouTube video or your Instagram post where you give them a recommendation of the best fishing hole in the world, and you give detailed instructions how to get there, but it's like a Lord of the Rings type of journey.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, right. No, I love the... There's a region that I definitely love in the states. It's special to me. I grew up there, stuff like that. Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, those are really cool places to me. The small town vibes they're still maintaining and stuff there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A mix of mountains and forests?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Where they did Alone, it's not typically what you'd say, because it's fairly flat, and cliffy, and stuff. But it really became beautiful to me because I could tap into the richness of the land or the fishing hole thing. It was like that's a special little spot, something like that. And you see beauty and then you start to see the beauty in the smaller scale like, \"Look at that little meadow that it's got an orange, and a pink, and a blue flower right next to each other. That's super cool.\" And there's a million things like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you been back there yet, back to where the Alone show was?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out. And then plan to go overnight. Don't be so afraid of all the potentialities that you delay it inevitably. It's actually one of the things that I've enjoyed the most about guiding people, is giving them the tools so that now they have this ability into the future. You can go out and feel like, \"I'm going to pick this spot on the map and go there.\" And that's a tool in your toolkit of life that is I think really valuable, because I think everybody should spend some time in nature. I think it's been pretty proven healthy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean camping is great. And solo, I got a chance to do it solo, is pretty cool.<|eot_id|>"}

It was really interesting to have to be so thoughtful and purposeful about what you're saying and things. I think it's probably a healthy, good thing to do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gives you hope about this whole thing we have going on, the future of human civilization?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If we talked about gratitude earlier, look at what we have now. That could give you hope. Look at the world we're in.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and the modern medicine, the things that we now have that we take for granted, but that I wouldn't choose that life if we didn't have those things, because otherwise you're going to watch your family starve to death or things like that. So we have so much now, which should lead us to be hopeful while we try to improve, because there's definitely a lot of things wrong. But I guess there's a lot of room for improvement, and I do feel like we're sort of walking on a knife's edge, but I guess that's the way it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As the tools we build become more powerful?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. Knife is getting sharper and sharper. I'll argue with my brother about that.

It's just going to take one mistake with the more power.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there's something about the sharpness of the knife's edge that gets humanity to really focus, and step up, and not screw it up.

Thank you for everything you stand for.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Jonas. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me try a new thing where I try to articulate some things I've been thinking about, whether prompted by one of your questions or just in general. If you'd like to submit a question including in audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama. Now allow me to comment on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13th. First, as I've posted online, wishing Donald Trump good health after an assassination attempt is not a partisan statement. It's a human statement. And I'm sorry if some of you want to categorize me and other people into blue and red bins. Perhaps you do it because it's easier to hate than to understand. In this case it shouldn't matter. But let me say once again that I am not right-wing nor left-wing. I'm not partisan. I make up my mind one issue at a time, and I try to approach everyone and every idea with empathy and with an open mind. I have and will continue to have many long-form conversations with people both on the left and the right. Now onto the much more important point, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump should serve as a reminder that history can turn on a single moment. World War I started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. And just like that, one moment in history on June 18th, 1914 led to the death of 20 million people, half of whom were civilians. If one of the bullets on July 13th had a slightly different trajectory, where Donald Trump would end up dying in that small town in Pennsylvania, history would write a new dramatic chapter, the contents of which all the so-called experts and pundits would not be able to predict. It very well could have led to a civil war, because the true depth of the division in the country is unknown. We only see the surface turmoil on social media and so on. And it is events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand where we as a human species get to find out what the truth is of where people really stand. The task then is to try and make our society maximally resilient and robust as such to stabilizing events. The way to do that, I think, is to properly identify the threat, the enemy. It's not the left or the right that are the \"enemy,\" extreme division itself is the enemy. Some division is productive. It's how we develop good ideas and policies, but too much leads to the spread of resentment and hate that can boil over into destruction on a global scale. So we must absolutely avoid the slide into extreme division. There are many ways to do this, and perhaps it's a discussion for another time. But at the very basic level, let's continuously try to turn down the temperature of the partisan bickering and more often celebrate our obvious common humanity. Now let me also comment on conspiracy theories. I've been hearing a lot of those recently. I think they play an important role in society. They ask questions that serve as a check on power and corruption of centralized institutions. The way to answer the questions raised by conspiracy theories is not by dismissing them with arrogance and feigned ignorance, but with transparency and accountability. In this particular case, the obvious question that needs an honest answer is, why did the Secret Service fail so terribly in protecting the former president? The story we're supposed to believe is that a 20-year-old untrained loner was able to outsmart the Secret Service by finding the optimal location on a roof for a shot on Trump from 130 yards away, even though the Secret Service snipers spotted him on the roof 20 minutes before the shooting and did nothing about it. This looks really shady to everyone. Why does it take so long to get to a full accounting of the truth of what happened? And why is the reporting of the truth concealed by corporate government speak? Cut the bullshit. What happened? Who fucked up and why? That's what we need to know. That's the beginning of transparency. And yes, the director of the US Secret Service should probably step down or be fired by the president, and not as part of some political circus that I'm sure is coming. But as a step towards uniting an increasingly divided and cynical nation. Conspiracy theories are not noise, even when they're false. They are a signal that some shady, corrupt, secret bullshit is being done by those trying to hold on to power. Not always, but often. Transparency is the answer here, not secrecy. If we don't do these things, we leave ourselves vulnerable to singular moments that turn the tides of history. Empires do fall, civil wars do break out, and tear apart the fabric of societies. This is a great nation, the most successful collective human experiment in the history of earth. And letting ourselves become extremely divided risks destroying all of that. So please ignore the political pundits, the political grifters, clickbait media, outrage fueling politicians on the right and the left who try to divide us. We're not so divided. We're in this together. As I've said many times before, I love you all. This is a long comment. I'm hoping not to do comments this long in the future and hoping to do many more. So I'll leave it here for today, but I'll try to answer questions and make comments on every episode. If you would like to submit questions, like I mentioned, including audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama, and now let leave you with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson, \" Adopt the pace of nature. Her secret is patience.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
