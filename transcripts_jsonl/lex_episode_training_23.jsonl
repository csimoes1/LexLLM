{"text": "<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Jordan Jonas, winner of Alone Season 6, a show where the task is to survive alone in the arctic wilderness longer than anyone else. He is widely considered to be one of, if not the greatest competitors on that show. He has a fascinating life story that took him from a farm in Idaho and hoboing on trains across America to traveling with tribes in Siberia. All that helped make him into a world-class explorer, survivor, hunter, wilderness guide, and most importantly, a great human being with a big heart and a big smile. This was a truly fun and fascinating conversation. Let me also mention that at the end, after the episode, I'll start answering some questions and we'll try to articulate my thinking on some top-of-mind topics. So, if that's of interest to you, keep listening after the episode is over. This is The Lex Fridman Podcast. Support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Jonas. You won Alone Season 6, and I think are still considered to be one of, if not the most successful survivor on that show. So let's go back, let's look at the big picture. Can you tell me about the show Alone? How does it work?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you go from that moment of frustration to the moment of acceptance?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sooner you can, the better. Accept it and then learn from it, it is kind of a muscle you have to exercise a little bit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's interesting because in this case, the cost of failure is like you're not going to be able to eat.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that experience in particular. So yeah, it was pretty awesome. But the pressure felt very on. I always felt the pressure of providing or starving.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's the situation when you left the ladder up and you needed fat, and what is it? Wolverine need some of the fat.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>intense because those wolverines, they're bold little animals and he was basically saying, \"No, this is my moose.\" And I had to counter his claims.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, they're really, really smart. They figure out a way to get to places really effectively. Wolverines are fascinating in that way. So, let's go to that happy moment, the moose.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that joy because it was just so real, so directly connected to your needs. It's all so simple.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it and when you actually recover the animal, get your hands on it.

What it takes to stay calm, to not freak out too much, to wait, but not wait too long?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>kind of a technique. I am going to go back, touch my face, draw my elbow tight, and then the arrow's going to let loose.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So muscle memory, mostly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sunk the arrow all the way into the moose, but it allowed that second lung to stay breathing, which meant the moose stayed alive longer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your relationship with the animal in the situation like that?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so, so thankful that I wanted to give that big guy a hug and like, \"Hey, sorry, it was you, but had to be somebody.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's that picture of you just almost hugging it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right? Totally.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can also think about it, the calories, the protein, the fat, all of that, that comes from that, that will feed you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. You're so grateful for it. The gratitude is definitely there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the bow and arrow perspective?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>kind of the best times to hunt are usually allowed for bow because they're trying to keep it fair for the animal and such.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're one of the predators where you have to be clever, you have to be quiet, you have to be calm, you have to, all of that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how many times do they snap a stick and watch them run off, and, \"Darn, my stock was failed.\" So yeah, you're in that ecosystem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How'd you learn to shoot the bow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it gave you a lot of opportunities to learn quickly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to catch anything needlessly. And, you come to find out you can't live off of rabbits, man cannot live off rabbit alone it turns out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you set up a huge number of traps. You were also fishing and then always on the lookout for moose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in terms of survival, if you were to do it over again, over and over and over and over, how do you maximize your chance of having enough food to survive for a long time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I actually had what I thought was a pretty good plan going into Alone, and the location didn't allow for what I thought it would.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the plan?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and to keep hunting again. And you just have to roll off of that. But it depends on where you are, what opportunities are there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so that's the process. Fishing and trapping until you're successful hunting. And then the successful hunt buys you some more time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You just go year round.<|eot_id|>"}

It made me really appreciate what people had to deal with.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, in terms of being active, so you have to do stuff all day. So you get up-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Get up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... and planning like, \"What am I going to...\" In the midst of the frustration, you have to figure out what's the strategy, how do you put up all the traps? Is that a decision, like most people sit at their desk and have a calendar, whatever, are you figuring out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or 10 snares, you're constantly adding to your productive potential, but nothing's really scheduled. You're just kind of flying by the seat of your pants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then there's a lot of instinct that's already loaded.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, there's so much. Yeah,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just wisdom from all the times you've had to do it before that you're just actually operating a lot on instinct, like you said, where to place the shelter, how hard is that calculation, where to place the shelter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all these factors even down to taking in what game is doing in the area also, and how that relates to where your shelter is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said you have to consider where the action will be, and you want to be away from the action, but close enough to it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>incorporate, and then you just become creative.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you don't have seals and things like that, but as long as the air's not moving through it, you can have a warm enough shelter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>With a fire.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>With a fire and dry your socks and stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you get the smoke out of the shelter?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you have good clay and mud and rock, you can build yourself a fireplace, which is surprisingly not that hard. You just-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, really?<|eot_id|>"}

But that's an interesting metaphor of just get something that works. You see a lot of this with companies, like successful companies, they get a prototype, get a system that's working and improve fast in response to the conditions to environment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because it's constantly changing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Forcing that through the pipeline, whether or not it fits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you just speak to the place you were, the Canadian Arctic? It looked cold.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. And the remnants stayed back there. It's very interesting to think through history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Within language, it contains a history of a people, and it's interesting how that evolves over time and how wars tell the story. Language tells the story of conflict and conflict shapes language, and we get the result of that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. So, fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the barriers that language creates is also the thing that leads to wars and misunderstandings and all this kind of stuff.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>make sure you're still feeling things and that you're not toughen through it. Because you can't really tough through the cold.

I wonder if you're born with that or if that's developed maybe your time in Siberia or do you gravitate towards it? I wonder what that is because I really don't like survival in the cold.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sudden you have your little refuge, have a nice warm fire going in your teepee, and then I bet you could learn to appreciate it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think some of it is just opening yourself up to the possibility that there's something enjoyable about it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so, you just like, I look like you do in the cold. I don't think I enjoy the heat, but you just allow yourself to enjoy it.<|eot_id|>"}

Maybe that's a thing that I struggle with is the time passes slower. It does make you feel alive, you get to feel time. But then, the flip side of that is you get to feel every moment and you get to feel alive in every moment. So, it's both scary when you're inexperienced and beautiful when you are experienced. Were there times when you got hungry?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in Russia. There were times when I lost a lot of weight. I lost a lot more weight in Siberia than I did on Alone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|>"}

And maybe that's the challenge he also has to face is to make things look hard.

And in conversation comes out really interesting kinds of wisdom. When I listen to world leaders that speak Russian speak, and I see the translation, and it loses the irony.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a gradual process, a little bit at a time.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know when I'm talking about something else than what someone else might think of when they hear me talking about it. So, it's interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've been listening to Jordan Peterson talk about this. He has a way of articulating things, which are sometimes hard to understand in the moment, but when I read it carefully afterwards, it starts to make more sense. I've heard him talk about religion and God as a base layer, like a metaphorical substrate from which morality of our sense of what is right and wrong comes from, and just our conceptions of what is beautiful in life, all these kinds of higher things that are fuzzy to understand, that their religion helps create this substrate for which we, as a species, as a civilization, can come up with these notions. And without it, you are lost at sea. I guess for him, morality requires that substrate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't really know where you go from there. Actually isn't a funny to speak to that. I did mushroom. Have you ever done those before?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. Mushrooms, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>way to relate to it. And I was like, \"Wow, that was really powerful to me,\" and putting it in a context that was applicable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But ultimately, God is the thing that's formless, that is unbounded, but we humans need.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's the purpose of stories.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Can't relate to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We can't relate to it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but I also really see the baby that's being thrown out with the bathwater. And I want to cherish that, in a way, I guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's interesting that you say that the way to know what's right and wrong is you have to live it. Sometimes, it's probably very difficult to articulate. But in the living of it, do you realize it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then that's where it gains life and how that... and I'm sure that relates to what Jordan Peterson is getting at in his metaphor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the striving of the ideal, in the striving towards the ideal, you discover how to be a better person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>everybody start from square one, or we can try to redeem what's valuable in this and wrestle with it. And so, I chose that path.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I do think it's like a wrestling match. You mentioned Gulag Archipelago. I'm very much a believer that we all have the capacity for good and evil. And striving for the ideal to be a good human being is not a trivial one. You have to find the right tools for yourself to be able to be the candle, as you mentioned before.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. I like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then for that, religion and faith can help. I'm sure there's other ways, but I think it's grounded in understanding that each human is able to be a really bad person and a really good person. And that's a choice. It's a deliberate choice. And it's a choice that's taken every moment and builds up over time. And the hard part about it's you don't know. You don't always have the clarity using reason to understand what is good and what is right and what is wrong. You have to live it with humility and constantly struggle. Because then, yeah, you might wake up on a society where you're committing genocides and you think you're the good guys. And I think you have to have the courage to realize you're not. It's not always obvious.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It isn't, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>History has the clarity to show who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>goes through the heart of every man, and we push it this way and that. And our job is to work on that within ourselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's the part. That's what I like. The full quote talks about the fact that it moves. The line moves moment by moment, day by day. We have the freedom to move that line. So, it is a very deliberate thing. It's not like you're born this way and it's it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And especially in conditions that are worn peace, in the case of the camps, absurd levels of injustice, in the face of all that, when everything is taken away from you, you still have the choice to be the candle like the grandmas.

I was watching a documentary on polar bears. They just figure out a way, and they've been doing it for generations, and they figure out a way. They travel hundreds of miles to the water to get fat, and they travel 100 miles for whatever other purpose because they want to stay on the ice. I don't know. But there's a process, and they figure it out against the long odds, and some of them don't make it.<|eot_id|>"}

I just thought it was interesting, because this is in contrast to on the show Alone, you are really alone, you're not talking to anybody. And you realize that, you write, \"I remember at one point, after several weeks had passed, I wondered into a particular beautiful part of the woods and exclaimed out loud, 'Wow.'

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jordan Jonas. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me try a new thing where I try to articulate some things I've been thinking about, whether prompted by one of your questions or just in general. If you'd like to submit a question including in audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama. Now allow me to comment on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13th. First, as I've posted online, wishing Donald Trump good health after an assassination attempt is not a partisan statement. It's a human statement. And I'm sorry if some of you want to categorize me and other people into blue and red bins. Perhaps you do it because it's easier to hate than to understand. In this case it shouldn't matter. But let me say once again that I am not right-wing nor left-wing. I'm not partisan. I make up my mind one issue at a time, and I try to approach everyone and every idea with empathy and with an open mind. I have and will continue to have many long-form conversations with people both on the left and the right. Now onto the much more important point, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump should serve as a reminder that history can turn on a single moment. World War I started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. And just like that, one moment in history on June 18th, 1914 led to the death of 20 million people, half of whom were civilians. If one of the bullets on July 13th had a slightly different trajectory, where Donald Trump would end up dying in that small town in Pennsylvania, history would write a new dramatic chapter, the contents of which all the so-called experts and pundits would not be able to predict. It very well could have led to a civil war, because the true depth of the division in the country is unknown. We only see the surface turmoil on social media and so on. And it is events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand where we as a human species get to find out what the truth is of where people really stand. The task then is to try and make our society maximally resilient and robust as such to stabilizing events. The way to do that, I think, is to properly identify the threat, the enemy. It's not the left or the right that are the \"enemy,\" extreme division itself is the enemy. Some division is productive. It's how we develop good ideas and policies, but too much leads to the spread of resentment and hate that can boil over into destruction on a global scale. So we must absolutely avoid the slide into extreme division. There are many ways to do this, and perhaps it's a discussion for another time. But at the very basic level, let's continuously try to turn down the temperature of the partisan bickering and more often celebrate our obvious common humanity. Now let me also comment on conspiracy theories. I've been hearing a lot of those recently. I think they play an important role in society. They ask questions that serve as a check on power and corruption of centralized institutions. The way to answer the questions raised by conspiracy theories is not by dismissing them with arrogance and feigned ignorance, but with transparency and accountability. In this particular case, the obvious question that needs an honest answer is, why did the Secret Service fail so terribly in protecting the former president? The story we're supposed to believe is that a 20-year-old untrained loner was able to outsmart the Secret Service by finding the optimal location on a roof for a shot on Trump from 130 yards away, even though the Secret Service snipers spotted him on the roof 20 minutes before the shooting and did nothing about it. This looks really shady to everyone. Why does it take so long to get to a full accounting of the truth of what happened? And why is the reporting of the truth concealed by corporate government speak? Cut the bullshit. What happened? Who fucked up and why? That's what we need to know. That's the beginning of transparency. And yes, the director of the US Secret Service should probably step down or be fired by the president, and not as part of some political circus that I'm sure is coming. But as a step towards uniting an increasingly divided and cynical nation. Conspiracy theories are not noise, even when they're false. They are a signal that some shady, corrupt, secret bullshit is being done by those trying to hold on to power. Not always, but often. Transparency is the answer here, not secrecy. If we don't do these things, we leave ourselves vulnerable to singular moments that turn the tides of history. Empires do fall, civil wars do break out, and tear apart the fabric of societies. This is a great nation, the most successful collective human experiment in the history of earth. And letting ourselves become extremely divided risks destroying all of that. So please ignore the political pundits, the political grifters, clickbait media, outrage fueling politicians on the right and the left who try to divide us. We're not so divided. We're in this together. As I've said many times before, I love you all. This is a long comment. I'm hoping not to do comments this long in the future and hoping to do many more. So I'll leave it here for today, but I'll try to answer questions and make comments on every episode. If you would like to submit questions, like I mentioned, including audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama, and now let leave you with some words from Ralph Waldo Emerson, \" Adopt the pace of nature. Her secret is patience.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
