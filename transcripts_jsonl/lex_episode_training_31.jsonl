I traveled there to hang out with Paul and it turned out to be an adventure of a lifetime. I'll post a video capturing some aspects of that adventure, in a week or so. It included everything, from getting lost in dense, unexplored wilderness with no contact to the outside world, to taking very high doses of ayahuasca and much more. Paul, by the way, aside from being my good friend, is a naturalist, explorer, author, and is someone who has dedicated his life to protecting the rainforest. For this mission, he founded Jungle Keepers. You can help him, if you go to junglekeepers.org. This trip, for me, was life-changing. It expanded my understanding of myself and of the beautiful world I'm fortunate to exist in with all of you. So I'm glad I went and I'm glad I made it out alive. This is a Lex Fridman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Paul Rosolie. I can't believe we're actually here.<|eot_id|>"}

I think if they're here, they're here in ways that are not comprehensible by humans, because they're far more advanced than humans. They're far more advanced than any life forms on earth. So even if it's just their probes, we cannot just even comprehend it. I think it's possible that they operate in the space of ideas, for example, that ideas could be aliens, feelings could be aliens. Consciousness itself could be aliens. So we can't restrict our understanding of what is a life form to a thing that is a biological creature that operates via natural selection on this particular planet. It could be much, much, much more sophisticated. It could be in a space of computation, for example. As we in the 21st century are developing increasingly sophisticated computational systems with artificial intelligence, it could be operating on some other level that we can't even imagine. It could be operating on a level of physics that we have not even begun to understand. We barely understand quantum mechanics. We use it. Quantum mechanics is a way we used to make very accurate predictions, but to understand why it's operating that way, we don't. And there's so many gigantic powerful cosmic entities out there that we detect, sometimes can't detect, dark matter, dark energy, but it's out there. We know it exists, but we can't explain why and what the fuck it is. We give it names, black holes and dark energy and dark matter, but those are all names for things that mathematical equations predict, but we don't understand. And so all of that is just to say that aliens could be here in ways that are for now and maybe for a long time going to be impossible for humans to understand.<|eot_id|>"}

I don't want to simplify it, but there is something that creates complexity out of simplicity that we don't quite understand.

You're trying to figure out history with so little information. You're trying to put together this puzzle when you have so little and you're desperately clinging onto little clues and from those clues using the simple possible explanation to understand. And now with modern technology, as Flint was trying to express, that you can use large amounts of data that's imperfect, but just the scale and using that to reconstruct civilizations. There are different practices from the little details of what things they eat, how they interact with each other, what art they create to when they existed, what are the timeframes, all that kind of stuff. And that starts to fill in the gaps of our understanding. But still, the error bars are large in terms of what really happened.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we were united in the simple reality of the fact that we were so thirsty that it hurt and that it was a little scary.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it was scary. But also there was a joy in the interaction with the water because it cools your body temperature down and there's a faith in that interaction that eventually we'll find clean water because water's plentiful on earth. It's like a delusional faith that eventually we'll find. It was just a little celebration. I think the cooling aspect of the water, because the body temperature is really high from traversing the really dense jungle, just the cooling was somehow grounding in a way that nothing else really is. It was a little celebration of life, of life on earth, of earth, of the jungle, of everything. It was a nice moment. I think about that. Had a couple of those. There was one in the puddle and one in the river. One was full of delusion and fear, and the other one was full of relief and celebration.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so good to be so lost and so tired. How would you describe the physicality of what we were doing, the level of physical exertion?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's something that I haven't trained. I don't even know how you would train for that kind of thing, but it's extremely dense jungle so every single step is completely unpredictable in terms of the terrain your foot interacts with. So the different variety of slippery that is on the jungle floor is fascinating. Because some things, the slope matters, but some roots of trees are slippery, some are not. Some trees in the ground are already rotted through so if you step through, you're going to potentially fall through. It could be a shallow hole. It could be a very deep hole with some leaves and vegetation covering up a hole where, if you fall through, you could break a leg and completely lose your footing or fall rolling downhill. And if you roll downhill, I'm pretty sure there's a 99% probability that you'll hit a thing with spikes on it. So there's so many layers of avoiding dangers, of small dangers and big dangers, all around you with every single step. So there's a mental exhaustion that sets in, just the perception. And just observing you, you're extremely good at perceiving, having situational awareness, of taking the information in that's really important and filtering out the stuff that's not important. But even for you, that's exhausting. And, for me, it was completely exhausting just paying attention, paying attention to everything around you. So that exhaustion was surprising. Because there's moments when you're like, \"I don't give a anymore. I'm just going to step. I'm just going to [inaudible 02:41:22].\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You go, \"I don't care anymore,\" and you reach out, and I'm just going to lean against this tree. And then what happened every time?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You get spikes in it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then you have to care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's just bad luck because there is wasp nests. There's just a million things. And that is physically, is mentally, psychologically exhausting, because there's the uncertainty, when is this going to end? It's, in our particular situation, up and down hills, up and down hills, very steep downward, very steep upward, no water, all this kind of stuff. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it's very difficult to describe what are the parameters that make it difficult because I run long distances very regular. I do extremely difficult physical things regularly that on some surface level could seem much more challenging than what we did. But no, this was another beast. This is something else but it was also raw and real and beautiful because it's what the explorers did. It's what earth is without humans. And also just the massive scale of the trees around us was the humbling size difference between human and tree. It's both humbling in that, \"That tree is really old. It's the time difference, lifetime difference, and just the scale, it's like, holy shit. We live on an earth that can create those things. Makes me feel small in every way, that life is short, that my physical presence on this earth is tiny, how vulnerable I am. All of those feelings were there. And in that, the physical endurance of traversing the jungle was the hardest journey that I remember ever taking, every step. And then that made making it out of the jungle and then made it the swim in the water that we could drink, that was just pure joy. It was probably one of the happiest moments in my life just sitting there with you, Paul, and with JJ in the water, full darkness, the rain coming down and us all just laughing having made it through that, having eaten a bit of food before and the absurdity of the timing of all of it that it somehow worked out.

That's a really mind-blowing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, so for people who don't know that show, you're supposed to survive as long as possible. On season 7 of the show, they literally said you can only win it if you survive a hundred days. And there's a lot of aspects of that show that's difficult, one of which is it's in the cold. The other is they get just a handful of supplies, no food, nothing, none of that. So they have to figure all of that out. And this is probably one of the greatest performers on the show, Roland Welker, he built a rock house shelter. So I mean, what does survival entail? It's building a shelter, fire, catching food, staying warm, getting enough energy to sort of keep doing the work. It takes a lot of work. Like building the Rock House, I read that, it took 500 calories an hour from him, so he had to feed himself quite a lot. You're lifting 200 pound boulders and still the guy lost, I read, 44 pounds, which is 20% of his body weight. So that's survival. What lessons, what inspiration do you draw from him?<|eot_id|>"}

And she had a very different perspective as you know Roland didn't want any of the spirituality, it's very pragmatic. And for Callie, it is very spiritual connection to the land. She said something like she wanted not only to take from the land, but to give back. I mean, there's this kind of poetic spiritual connection to the land. It's such a dire contrast to Roland. But she's still a badass. I mean to survive no matter what, no matter the kind of personality, you have to be a badass. I think she took a porcupine quill from her shoulder.<|eot_id|>"}

And there's another guy, Jordan Jonas Hobojordo, he's the season 6 winner. And he said that the camera made him feel less lonely.

And even though you have people around you when you don't speak their language, it feels really, really lonely. And he felt less lonely on the show because he had the camera and he felt like he could talk to the camera. There is an element when you have in these harsh conditions, if you record something, you feel like you're talking to another human through it, even if it's just a recording.

They've families, they're basically trying to survive and they're desperate and they're doing the thing that will bring them money. And so they're just human beings at the core of it. If they have other options, they will probably choose to give their life to saving the community, to first and foremost providing for their family, and after that, saving the community, helping the community flourish.

And there's also very dark things that happen along the way as the communities around the goldmines are created. So that the entirety of the moral system that emerges from that, that has things like prostitution where one third of the women that are drawn into that sex traffic and prostitution are minors under 17 years old, 13 to 17-year-old.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so it's really a win-win for the animals, for the rangers, for the rainforest, for people, it's biocentric conservation.

I've read in an article that said, \"An estimated 1200 girls between ages of 12 and 17 are forcibly drafted into child prostitution around the communities in the gold mines, at least one-third of the prostitutes in the camp are underage. The girls had ended up in the camp after receiving a tip that there were restaurants looking for waitresses and willing to pay top dollar. They jumped on a bus together and came down to the rainforest. What they found was not what they were expecting. The mining camp restaurants served food for only a few hours a day. The rest of the time, it was the girls themselves who were on the menu. Literally at the end of the road, and without the money to return home, the girls would soon become trapped in prostitution.\"<|eot_id|>"}

Of course, the friendships and social interaction. That's a really big one actually. That one, I'm taking for granted because I didn't get a chance yet to really spend time alone. And when I came here, I've gotten a chance to hang out with you. And there's a kind of camaraderie, there's a friendship there that if that's broken, that's a tough one too. You spent quite a lot of time alone in the jungle. Ever get a alone out here?<|eot_id|>"}

You ever just get alone out here. Just this sense of existential dread of what... The jungle has a way of not caring about any individual organism because it just kind of churns.
