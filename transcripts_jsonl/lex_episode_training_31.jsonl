There's vegetation, there's insects, there's all kinds of creatures. A million heartbeats, a million eyes. So really, where are we right now?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We are in Peru, in a very remote part of the Western Amazon basin. And because of the proximity of the Andean Cloud Forest to the lowland tropical rainforest, we are in the most bio-diverse part of planet Earth. There is more life per square acre, per square mile out here than there is anywhere else on Earth, not just now, but in the entire fossil record.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Paul Rosolie, his second time on the podcast, but this time we did the conversation deep in the Amazon jungle. I traveled there to hang out with Paul and it turned out to be an adventure of a lifetime. I'll post a video capturing some aspects of that adventure, in a week or so. It included everything, from getting lost in dense, unexplored wilderness with no contact to the outside world, to taking very high doses of ayahuasca and much more. Paul, by the way, aside from being my good friend, is a naturalist, explorer, author, and is someone who has dedicated his life to protecting the rainforest. For this mission, he founded Jungle Keepers. You can help him, if you go to junglekeepers.org. This trip, for me, was life-changing. It expanded my understanding of myself and of the beautiful world I'm fortunate to exist in with all of you. So I'm glad I went and I'm glad I made it out alive. This is a Lex Fridman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Paul Rosolie. I can't believe we're actually here.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was the people's choice, trust me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right. We've been through quite a lot over the last few days.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We've been through a bit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you a ridiculous question. What are all the creatures right now, if they wanted to, could cause us harm?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>jaguar. A stingray needs a stinger on its tail, which is basically a serrated knife with venom on it, to deter anything that would hunt that stingray. Even the catfish have pectoral fins that have razor-long, steak-knife sized defense systems. Then you, of course, the jaguars, the harp eagles, the piranha, the candiru fish that can swim up a penis, lodge themselves inside, it's the Amazon rainforest. The thing is, as you've learned this week, nothing here wants to get us, with the exception of, maybe, mosquitoes. Every other animal just wants to eat and exist in peace, that's it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But each of those animals, like you described, have a kind of radius of defense.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you accidentally step into its home-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Into that radius, it can cause harm.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Or make them feel threatened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Make them feel threatened. There is a defense mechanism that is activated.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Some incredible defense mechanism, I mean, you're talking about 17-foot black caiman crocodiles with significant size, that could rip you in half. Anacondas, the largest snake on Earth, bushmasters that can grow up to be nine to, I think even 11- feet long. And I've caught bushmasters that are thicker than my arms.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So for people who don't know, bushmaster snakes, what are these things?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>These are vipers, I believe it's the largest viper on Earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Venomous?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Extremely venomous, with hinge teeth, tissue destroying venom.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's like even this seemingly beautiful little fern. If you go this way on the fern, you're fine, as soon as, ou, as soon as you go this way-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's invisible little spikes on there, if you want to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, I see.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The jungle and you get one of these, it'll just tear all the skin right off your body.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you find yourself staring, a couple feet away from a bushmaster snake, what are you doing? You're, for people who somehow don't know, are somebody who loves, admires snakes, who has met thousands of snakes, has worked with them, respects them, celebrates them. What would you do with a bushmaster snake, face-to-face?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Face-to-face, this has happened, I have been there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and this bushmaster turned its head towards me, looked at me and made it very clear, \"I'm going to go this way.\" And so I did the natural thing that any snake enthusiast would do, and I grabbed its tail. Now, 11-feet later, by the head, the snake turned around and just said, \"If you want to meet God, I can arrange the meeting. I will oblige.\" And I decided to let the bushmaster go. And so it's like that with most animals, a Jaguar will turn and look at you and just remind you of how small you are.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like what did you see-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\"Keep going.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the snake's eyes? How did you sense that this is going to be your end if you'd proceed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>His readiness. I wanted to get him by the tail and show him to the people that were there and maybe work with the snake a little bit. As an 11-foot snake, the snake turned around and made it very clear like, \"Not today, pal, it's not going to happen.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it in the eyes, in the movement, in the tension of the body?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was the movement and the S of the neck. It was as if you pushed me-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>[inaudible 00:07:51].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I went, \"Let's go, make my day.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Too ready. He was like, \"I love this.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, all right. So you know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You just know, whereas like the snake you met last night.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, beautiful snake.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Such a calm little thing, he just focuses on eating baby lizards and little snails and things. And that snake has no concept of defending itself, it has no way to defend itself. So even something the size of a blue jay, could just come and just pa, pa, pa, peck that thing in the head and swallow it and it's a helpless little snake. So it kind of depends on the animal, it depends on the mood you catch them in, each one has a different temperament.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The grace of its movement was mesmerizing, curious almost. Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing, projecting onto it, but it was-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The tongue flicking was a sign of curiosity, it was trying to figure out what was going on.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just these strange legless animals that just exist, they don't even have eyelids, they're so different than us. They have a tongue that senses the air, and they, to me, are so beautiful. And I've, my whole life, been defending snakes from humans and they seem misunderstood, I think they're incredibly beautiful. There's every color and variety of snakes, there's venomous snakes, there's tree snakes, there's huge, crushing anacondas, it's just... Of the 2,600 species of snakes that exist on Earth, there's just such beauty, such complexity and such simplicity.

It's the only thing that's cuter than a puppy, like watching a snake touch its mouth to water and you just see that little mouth going as they suck water in.

And he takes a water bottle and pours it onto the snake's nose and the snake turns up its nose and just starts drinking from the water bottle. Human giving water to snake, big scary snake, but this human understood, snake gets water, snake gets released in jungle, everybody is okay.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so sometimes the needs are simple, they just don't have the words to communicate them to us humans.<|eot_id|>"}

We're walking through the jungle late at night, and so it's darkness except our headlamps on and then all of a sudden Paul stops, he's like, \"Shh.\" And he looks in the distance and he sees two eyes, I think you thought, \"Is that a jaguar or is that a deer?\" And it was moving its head like this.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at you like that deer did, your first thing is, what animal is this that I am staring back at?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That they were zipping around her, biting her, and then going around.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was amazing. And for the first time, I got to stand there watching this incredible inter-species fight happening.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They deliver. Maybe, can you talk to that, like the power they can generate with their tail, with their neck, with their jaw?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Alligators and caiman and crocodiles have some of the strongest bite forces on Earth, think a saltwater crocodile wins, as the strongest bite force on Earth.

How do you compare the explosive force you felt from that animal compared to what a human can generate?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's difficult to describe in words, there was a lot of power. And we're talking about the power of the neck, like the, what is it? I mean, there's a lot, it could generate power all up and down the body, so probably the tail is a monster, but just the neck.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that's where, of the four species of caiman that we have here, you see differences in their personalities as a species.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

Now, if you scale that up to a black caiman, it's rib crushing, it's zebra-head removing size, just meat destroying.

So for me, seeing those eyes, I think I've become so comfortable with so many of these animals that I may have crossed into the territory where I feel so comfortable with many of these animals that they just don't worry me anymore. I mean, I looked at you in a raft, while you had a sizable, probably, about 12-foot black caiman right next to your raft.

And so to me, they are my friends and I worry about them, because two months ago we were coming up river and on one of the beaches was a beautiful, about five-foot black caiman with a big machete cut right through the head.

Obviously, it can't just sit in one spot. It has to put some work into it. And so they're using scent and they're using communication to use the streams.

And each one of those ancient trees, it's usually 500 years or more, is a valuable macaw generating site in the forest.

That's something also that I've seen in the jungle. That there's creatures using each other and it's like a dance of either mutually using each other or it's parasitic or symbiotic. It's interesting, there's a medicinal plant you grabbed that was full of ants that were trying to murder you by biting. But they were defending the plant that they were using for whatever purpose, but there's a clear dance there of the ants using the plant, and the plant existing, therefore other applications and other use for humans and there's that circle of life happening. But the ants were defense... So the plant didn't have its own defense mechanism, the ants, the army of ants was there to protect the plant.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Remember, we put our backpacks down at that one spot, and it was like the ants got on your backpack. And I said, \"Oh, shit.

And so we saw that spot where there was a perfect circle around the trees, because the ants had excavated the other vegetation so that those trees could have no competition to grow. The incredible calculation of how ants know to come programmed to garden that tree, and the tree somehow has been genetically informed to have ant habitat within itself. It's mind-blowing. And actually is the foundation of a lot of existential confusion for me, because how the hell is this possible?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. One of the things you mentioned that's also a source of a lot of existential confusion for me is ants, and the intelligence of different creatures in the forest. There's these giant colonies, there's these just giant systems. But even just looking at a single colony of ants, them collaborating, leaf-cutter ants is an incredible system. So individually, the ants seem kind of dumb and simplistic, but taken together, there is a vast intelligence operating that's able to be robust and resilient in any kind of conditions, is able to figure out a new environment, is able to be resilient to any kinds of attacks and all that kind of stuff.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But that's different than saying that they're living among us. If you tell me that there's aliens living five galaxies over and that they're just out there somewhere, I'm more on your side than that they're here, because just like Bigfoot, we have camera traps. We have DNA sequencing through water now. You're telling me no one found one wingnut of a ship in all... The Egyptians up until right now, no one in Russia saw a crashed ship, took a picture, tweeted that shit real quick and...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there's no Bigfoot, there's no trivial manifestations of aliens. I think if they're here, they're here in ways that are not comprehensible by humans, because they're far more advanced than humans. They're far more advanced than any life forms on earth. So even if it's just their probes, we cannot just even comprehend it. I think it's possible that they operate in the space of ideas, for example, that ideas could be aliens, feelings could be aliens. Consciousness itself could be aliens. So we can't restrict our understanding of what is a life form to a thing that is a biological creature that operates via natural selection on this particular planet. It could be much, much, much more sophisticated. It could be in a space of computation, for example. As we in the 21st century are developing increasingly sophisticated computational systems with artificial intelligence, it could be operating on some other level that we can't even imagine. It could be operating on a level of physics that we have not even begun to understand. We barely understand quantum mechanics. We use it. Quantum mechanics is a way we used to make very accurate predictions, but to understand why it's operating that way, we don't. And there's so many gigantic powerful cosmic entities out there that we detect, sometimes can't detect, dark matter, dark energy, but it's out there. We know it exists, but we can't explain why and what the fuck it is. We give it names, black holes and dark energy and dark matter, but those are all names for things that mathematical equations predict, but we don't understand. And so all of that is just to say that aliens could be here in ways that are for now and maybe for a long time going to be impossible for humans to understand.<|eot_id|>"}

But that's a single living organisms with a bunch of components to it, but there's a life form that exists in this world. What is the difference between that and a rock?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more romantic than that. But I think it's actually comical, how do you get from a rock to an orangutan?

Maybe there was nothing happening and then all of a sudden there was a cell and the cell had function, and then it complexified and then it started reproducing and found male and female parts. What? We are so under equipped to understand how the hell we got here, let alone ants or even bacteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I see this in very simple mathematical models like something called game of life, they're cellular automata. You can see from simple rules and simple objects when they're interacting together, as you grow that system, complex objects arise. That emergence of complexity is not understood by science, by mathematics at all. And it seems like from primordial soups, you can get a lot of cool shit. And the force of getting from soup to two humans on microphones, not understood, and it seems to be a thing that happens on Earth. I tend to think that it's a thing that happens everywhere in the universe, and there's some deep force that's pushing this along in some way. I don't want to simplify it, but there is something that creates complexity out of simplicity that we don't quite understand.

You're trying to figure out history with so little information. You're trying to put together this puzzle when you have so little and you're desperately clinging onto little clues and from those clues using the simple possible explanation to understand. And now with modern technology, as Flint was trying to express, that you can use large amounts of data that's imperfect, but just the scale and using that to reconstruct civilizations. There are different practices from the little details of what things they eat, how they interact with each other, what art they create to when they existed, what are the timeframes, all that kind of stuff. And that starts to fill in the gaps of our understanding. But still, the error bars are large in terms of what really happened.

This guy left his home, went out into the jungle, out there with horrendous gear compared to the camping gear we have today, no headlamp, and just explored for years on end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let me actually push back. You have that explorer. There is definitely a thing in you, just me having observed you behave in the jungle and in the world, you're pulled towards exploration, towards adventure, towards the possibility of discovering something beautiful, including a small little creature or a whole new part of the rainforest, a part of the world that is, holy shit, this is beautiful. I think that's the same imperative. Maybe not going out to the stars, but I could see you doing exactly the same thing. He disappeared in 1925 during an expedition to find an ancient lost city, which he and other people believed existed in the Amazon rainforest. There's that pull, I'm going to go into there with shitty equipment with the possibility of finding something.<|eot_id|>"}

And there's a great quote where he says, \" Without a machete...,\" something, I don't remember exactly the words he used, but he said, \"Without a machete in this environment, you don't last.\" And you know that now. In that tangle, to just take three steps that way, I would immediately be taking on... I'm not wearing shoes right now. Bullet ants, venomous snakes, spikes through my feet, tripping over myself. I don't have a headlamp. Unbelievable risk right there. We're sitting on the edge of tragedy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain what the purpose of the machete in this situation is? What is a machete? How does it work? How does it allow you to navigate in this exceptionally dense environment?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you are an agouti, a little rodent, or a jaguar, or a deer, you can slip through this stuff. And the deer have developed really small antlers, they can just weave through low to the ground. And so for us being these vertical beings walking through the jungle, it really helps to be able to move the sticks that are diagonally opposing your movement at all times, so a machete is just a very, very useful tool. It can help you pull thorns out of your body. As you saw last night, we can use it to find food.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You went machete fishing. You cut a fish head off with a machete. It was swimming and then you basically macheted the water. And the other fascinating thing about that fish without its head, it kept moving.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was just using, I guess, its nervous system to swim beautifully. There's so many questions there about how nature works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it, because the way the machete hit this fish, it took just his eyes off and his lower jaw was still there, so it was really just the brain and the top jaw that came off. And this fish, as the dust cleared in this stream, this fish was... I found it very haunting in a very interstellar way. It was just the programming was still there, but the brain was gone and the fish was just still moving and it was going to die, but it was still swimming and it looked like a live fish. It was gruesome.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're still trying to catch it, which is interesting to watch.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a bullet ant. And so even the fish here, a lot of the fish here have spikes coming out of them. And so even though I know that fish, I know its name, I've eaten them many times, as I was holding it, when it would twitch with that explosive power, just like the Cayman, I would get that fear response and release it. And so that happened three or four times before I finally said, this is stupid. Even though he's slippery, he hasn't got a head. I can hold onto him and I put them in my pocket.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Put him in your pocket.<|eot_id|>"}

And I'm grateful for his existence, of his role, and for my existence on this planet, this brief existence that I was able to enjoy that delicious, delicious fish. The machete is used to cut through this extremely dense jungle. There's vines, by the way. There's rope like things that are extremely strong and they go all kinds of directions. They go horizontal and all of this. We have a tree right above us that makes no sense. There's a tree that failed, and then a new tree was created on top of... ... failed and then a new tree was created on top of it. It just makes no sense. It feels like sometimes trees come from the sky, sometimes they come from the ground. I don't really quite understand how that works because there's new trees that grow on old trees and the old trees rot away and the new trees come up, that whole mechanism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>eventually that tree will die and the strangler fig will win because it got a boost up to the top. Whereas these little trees down here, they're going to have to wait their turn. They have to wait until a tree falls until there's a light gap and then they have enough food to grow quick. And so this whole thing is an energy economy. Everything is just trying to get sunlight. And so strangler figs, yeah, top-down trees growing, parasitic top-down octopus trees growing over other giant trees. And you've seen the size of some of the trees here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So back to Percy Fawcett and exploration.

To JJ, it's green paradise, and it's intense, but if you know what you're doing, which the local people surely do, well then, just beneath the sand, there's turtle eggs that you can eat and inside the nuts on the ground there's grubs that you can eat. And if you really needed to, you could just jump on a caiman and eat that because their tails are pretty full of meat and it's like there's actually unending amounts of food here. They were a strange bunch.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you're able to tune into that frequency, I feel like you and JJ are able to tune into the frequency of the jungle that is a provider, not a destroyer of human life.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back and a lot of the same places that Schultes went, now there's missionary schools and they're wearing discarded Nikes and whatever. I don't know if there's Nikes in the '70s, but Western stuff has made it in. They've been contacted, domesticated, forced into Western society, and a lot of them then forget the thousands and thousands of years that have gone into creating the medicinal botanical knowledge that the Indigenous possess about how to cure ear infections and how to treat illnesses from the medicinal compounds flowing through these trees is lost in a single generation with the modernization.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, he wrote The Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred Healing and the Hallucinogenic Powers. That is interesting. You mentioned how to discover that. How do you find those incredible plans, those incredible things that can warp your mind in all kinds of ways?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>species, it would take tens and tens of thousands of years or perhaps even centuries before even the possibility. It's like that thing, a bunch of chips on a keyboard how they write Hamlet. It's astronomical odds to get to, oh wait, this and this dose together. What the local people believe is that the gods revealed this secret through the jungle to us as a link to the spirit world, and that that's how we know this. Because if they didn't remember it from their ancestors, we would have no idea how to get this information from the wild.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I will likely do ayahuasca.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>happens is the journey is all inside and the shaman is supposed to be able to guide you through that. But in my experience, you're so deep inside like falling through nebulas out in space. No physical form. Or crawling through the jungle. It's really, really powerful. It's not like the recreational drugs that everyone does where you go, \"I did mushrooms and I could see music and I was talking to my friends.\" But no, you're face down on the floor, usually vomiting, sometimes shitting, having dialogues with the creator. And that can be traumatizing as well as amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a really good way of looking at it. It's a big house and you get to open doors that you never had before and discover what rooms are there inside you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of uncertainty, but I watched something very special happen to you, and that was, I saw you crouching by the side of this puddle, it wasn't even a flowing stream, so we couldn't drink it, and you were just trying to wash the sweat off of your shirt. And you looked at me and you just said, \"The only thing that I care about right now is water.\" And I feel like in that moment we were united in the simple reality of the fact that we were so thirsty that it hurt and that it was a little scary.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it was scary. But also there was a joy in the interaction with the water because it cools your body temperature down and there's a faith in that interaction that eventually we'll find clean water because water's plentiful on earth. It's like a delusional faith that eventually we'll find. It was just a little celebration. I think the cooling aspect of the water, because the body temperature is really high from traversing the really dense jungle, just the cooling was somehow grounding in a way that nothing else really is. It was a little celebration of life, of life on earth, of earth, of the jungle, of everything. It was a nice moment. I think about that. Had a couple of those. There was one in the puddle and one in the river. One was full of delusion and fear, and the other one was full of relief and celebration.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's this thing that they say where all the pleasure in life is derived from the transitions. When you're cold, warm feels good. When you're hot, cold feels good. When you're hungry, food feels good. And when you're that thirsty, water becomes God and it's all you want. And also the other thing is that, when we're out there, it felt so good to be so lost and so tired. How would you describe the physicality of what we were doing, the level of physical exertion?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's something that I haven't trained. I don't even know how you would train for that kind of thing, but it's extremely dense jungle so every single step is completely unpredictable in terms of the terrain your foot interacts with. So the different variety of slippery that is on the jungle floor is fascinating. Because some things, the slope matters, but some roots of trees are slippery, some are not. Some trees in the ground are already rotted through so if you step through, you're going to potentially fall through. It could be a shallow hole. It could be a very deep hole with some leaves and vegetation covering up a hole where, if you fall through, you could break a leg and completely lose your footing or fall rolling downhill. And if you roll downhill, I'm pretty sure there's a 99% probability that you'll hit a thing with spikes on it. So there's so many layers of avoiding dangers, of small dangers and big dangers, all around you with every single step. So there's a mental exhaustion that sets in, just the perception. And just observing you, you're extremely good at perceiving, having situational awareness, of taking the information in that's really important and filtering out the stuff that's not important. But even for you, that's exhausting. And, for me, it was completely exhausting just paying attention, paying attention to everything around you. So that exhaustion was surprising. Because there's moments when you're like, \"I don't give a anymore. I'm just going to step. I'm just going to [inaudible 02:41:22].\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And so that's it. You go, \"I don't care anymore,\" and you reach out, and I'm just going to lean against this tree. And then what happened every time?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You get spikes in it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then you have to care.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's just bad luck because there is wasp nests. There's just a million things. And that is physically, is mentally, psychologically exhausting, because there's the uncertainty, when is this going to end? It's, in our particular situation, up and down hills, up and down hills, very steep downward, very steep upward, no water, all this kind of stuff. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it's very difficult to describe what are the parameters that make it difficult because I run long distances very regular. I do extremely difficult physical things regularly that on some surface level could seem much more challenging than what we did. But no, this was another beast. This is something else but it was also raw and real and beautiful because it's what the explorers did. It's what earth is without humans. And also just the massive scale of the trees around us was the humbling size difference between human and tree. It's both humbling in that, \"That tree is really old. It's the time difference, lifetime difference, and just the scale, it's like, holy shit. We live on an earth that can create those things. Makes me feel small in every way, that life is short, that my physical presence on this earth is tiny, how vulnerable I am. All of those feelings were there. And in that, the physical endurance of traversing the jungle was the hardest journey that I remember ever taking, every step. And then that made making it out of the jungle and then made it the swim in the water that we could drink, that was just pure joy. It was probably one of the happiest moments in my life just sitting there with you, Paul, and with JJ in the water, full darkness, the rain coming down and us all just laughing having made it through that, having eaten a bit of food before and the absurdity of the timing of all of it that it somehow worked out. And how we're just three little humans sitting in a river. Just our heads emerged barely above water with jungle all around us. What a life.<|eot_id|>"}

Just everything he does is so hyperbolically incredible. To come out of war and have the other people you fought with go, \"This guy has no fear,\" he must've just been a psychopath and had no fear.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's all there is, if you hear about the people. And I think that, that is a tremendous metaphor for life, because whether you hear about that plane that crashed in the Andes and the people were alone and freezing and they had to eat each other, some of them made it out, some of them kept the fire burning. And Teddy Roosevelt voluntarily, after being President, threw himself into the Amazon rainforest and survived. Came so close to dying, but survived. And so perseverance is all of it. I think that's our quality as a human.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they also mapped. On the biology side it's interesting, but they mapped and documented a lot of the unknown geography and biodiversity. What does it take to do that? So when I see you move about the jungle, you're capturing a creature. You take a picture, write it down so you can find new creatures, find new things about the jungle, document them, a scientific perspective on the jungle. Back then there was even much less known about the jungle. So what do you think it takes to document, to map? ...less known about the jungle.

On season 7 of the show, they literally said you can only win it if you survive a hundred days. And there's a lot of aspects of that show that's difficult, one of which is it's in the cold. The other is they get just a handful of supplies, no food, nothing, none of that. So they have to figure all of that out. And this is probably one of the greatest performers on the show, Roland Welker, he built a rock house shelter. So I mean, what does survival entail? It's building a shelter, fire, catching food, staying warm, getting enough energy to sort of keep doing the work. It takes a lot of work. Like building the Rock House, I read that, it took 500 calories an hour from him, so he had to feed himself quite a lot. You're lifting 200 pound boulders and still the guy lost, I read, 44 pounds, which is 20% of his body weight. So that's survival. What lessons, what inspiration do you draw from him?<|eot_id|>"}

She said something like she wanted not only to take from the land, but to give back. I mean, there's this kind of poetic spiritual connection to the land. It's such a dire contrast to Roland.

And there's another guy, Jordan Jonas Hobojordo, he's the season 6 winner. And he said that the camera made him feel less lonely.

And even though you have people around you when you don't speak their language, it feels really, really lonely. And he felt less lonely on the show because he had the camera and he felt like he could talk to the camera. There is an element when you have in these harsh conditions, if you record something, you feel like you're talking to another human through it, even if it's just a recording.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So at the edges, that's when the mining happens and it's this ugly process of they're just destroying the jungle just for the surface layer of the sand or whatever that they processed to collect just little bits of gold. And there's also very dark things that happen along the way as the communities around the goldmines are created. So that the entirety of the moral system that emerges from that, that has things like prostitution where one third of the women that are drawn into that sex traffic and prostitution are minors under 17 years old, 13 to 17-year-old. There's just a lot of really, really dark stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

And then they start caring about the turtle eggs. And then all of a sudden they have a way of life and nobody needs to go steal anybody's kids to be a prostitute in a gold mine. That's horrible. And so it's really a win-win for the animals, for the rangers, for the rainforest, for people, it's biocentric conservation. It's just making everything better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I've read in an article that said, \"An estimated 1200 girls between ages of 12 and 17 are forcibly drafted into child prostitution around the communities in the gold mines, at least one-third of the prostitutes in the camp are underage. The girls had ended up in the camp after receiving a tip that there were restaurants looking for waitresses and willing to pay top dollar. They jumped on a bus together and came down to the rainforest. What they found was not what they were expecting. The mining camp restaurants served food for only a few hours a day. The rest of the time, it was the girls themselves who were on the menu. Literally at the end of the road, and without the money to return home, the girls would soon become trapped in prostitution.\"<|eot_id|>"}
