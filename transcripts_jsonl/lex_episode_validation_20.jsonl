{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I was trying to figure out how to do photorealistic AI photos, and it was ... Stable Diffusion by itself is not doing that well. The faces look all mangled, and it doesn't have enough resolution or something to do that well. But I started seeing these base models, these fine-tuned models, and people would train on porn, and I would try them and they would be very photorealistic. They would have bodies that actually made sense, body anatomy. But if you look at the photorealistic models that people use now, there's still core of porn there, of naked people. So I need to prompt out, and everybody needs to do this with AI startups, with imaging, you need to prompt out the naked stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have to keep reminding the model, \"You need to put clothes on the thing.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. \"Don't put naked,\" because it's very risky. I have Google Vision that checks every photo before it's shown to the user to check for NSFW.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like a nipple detector? Oh, an NSFW detector.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think my philosophy is very different than most people in startups, because most people in startups, they build a company and they raise money and they hire people and then they build a product and they find something that makes money. And I don't really raise money. I don't use VC funding, I do everything myself. I'm a designer, I'm the developer, I make everything, I make the logo. So for me, I'm much more scrappy. And because I don't have funding, I need to go fast. I need to make things fast to see if an idea works. I have an idea in my mind and I build it like a mini startup, and I launch it very quickly, within two weeks or something, of building it. And I check if there's demand and if people actually sign up and not just sign up, but if people actually pay money. They need to take out their credit cards, pay me money, and then I can see if the idea is validated. And most ideas don't work, as you say, most fail.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's this rapid iterative phase where you just build a prototype that works, launch it, see if people like it, improving it really, really quickly to see if people like it a little bit more enough to pay and all that. That whole rapid process is how you think of-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think it's very rapid. If I compare it to, for example, Google or big tech companies, especially Google right now is struggling. They made transformers, they invented all the AI stuff years ago and they never really shipped. They could have shipped ChatGPT for example, I heard, in 2019. And they never shipped it because they were so stuck in bureaucracy. But they had everything. They had the data, they had the tech, they had the engineers and they didn't do it. And it's because these big organizations, it can make you very slow. So being alone by myself on my laptop, in my underwear in a hotel room or something, I can ship very fast and I don't need to ask legal for, \"Oh, can you vouch for this?\" I can just go and ship.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you always code in your underwear?

But so he's always doing construction in the house and it's his hobby. And he taught me, when I'm depressed for something, he says, \"Get a big mountain of sand or something from construction, and just get a shovel and bring it to the other side and just do physical labor, do hard work, and do something, Set a goal, do something.\" And I did that with startups too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, construction is not about the destination, man.

I never stop work. I go to the next website or I make a new one or I make a new startup. So I'm always ... It gives you something to wake up in the morning and have coffee and kiss your girlfriend and then you have a goal, \"Today I'm going to fix this feature,\" or \"Today I'm going to fix this bug,\" or something. \"I'm going to do something.\" You have something to wake up to. And I think maybe especially as a man, also women, but you need a hard work. You need an endeavor, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much of the building that you do is about money? How much is it about just a deep internal happiness?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's really about fun, because I was doing it when I didn't make money. That's the point. So I was always coding, I was making music. I made electronic music, drum and bass music 20 years ago, and I was always making stuff. So I think creative expression is a meaningful work that's so important, it's so fun. It's so fun to have a daily challenge where you try to figure stuff out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the interesting thing is you built a lot of successful products and you never really wanted to take it to that level where you scale real big and sell it to a company or something like this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The problem is I don't dictate that. If more people start using, if millions of people suddenly start using it and it becomes big, I'm not going to say, \"Oh, stop signing up to my website and paying me money.\" But I never raised funding for it. And I think because I don't like the stressful life that comes with it. I have a lot of founder friends and they tell me secretly, with hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and stuff, and they tell me, \"Next time, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it like you, because it's more fun, it's more indie, it's more chill, it's more creative.\" They don't like this. They don't like to be manager, where you become a CEO, you become a manager. And I think a lot of people that start startups, when they become a CEO, they don't like that job actually, but they can't really exit it, but they like to do the groundwork, the coding. So I think that keeps you happy, doing something creative.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But it's interesting how people are pulled towards that, to scale, to go really big. And you don't have that honest reflection with yourself, what actually makes you happy? Because for a lot of great engineers, what makes them happy is the building, the \"individual contributor,\" where you're actually still coding or you're actually still building, and they let go of that and then they become unhappy. But some of that is the sacrifice needed to have a impact at scale, if you truly believe in a thing you're doing.<|eot_id|>"}

There's a lot of bullshit in this world, I think. There's a lot of dodgy finance stuff happening there, I think. And I never have concrete evidence about it, but your gut tells you something's going on with companies getting sold to friends and VCs and then they do reciprocity, and there's shady financial dealings. With Elon, there's not. He's just raising money from investors and he's actually building stuff. He needs the money to build stuff, hardware stuff.

And all my friends got normal jobs and we stopped hanging out because people in university hang out, you chill at each other's houses, you go party. But when people get jobs, they only party in the weekend and they don't hang anymore in the week because you need to be at the office. And I was like, \"This is not for me.

I started going crazy, because I didn't really see my future in Holland, buying a house, going living in the suburbs and stuff. So I flew out. I went to Asia, started digital nomading, and did that for a year. And then that made me feel even worse because I was alone in hotel rooms looking at the ceiling, \"What am I doing with my life? This is ...\" I was working on startups and stuff, and YouTube, but I was like, \"What is the future here? Is this something ...\" while my friends in Holland were doing really well and with a normal life, so it was getting very depressed and I'm a outcast. My money was shrinking, I wasn't making money anymore, a lot. I was making $500 a month or something. And I was looking at the ceiling thinking, \"Now I'm 27, I'm a loser.\" And that's the moment when I started building startups.

You can't just sit still.\" Which is an interesting way to deal with depression. It's not, \"Oh, let's talk about it,\" it's more, \"Let's go do something.\" And I started doing a project called 12 Startups in 12 months where every month I would make something like a project and I would launch it with Stripe so people could pay for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the basic format is, try to build a thing, put it online, and put Stripe to where you can pay money for it.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the hard part is figuring out what you shouldn't add, what you shouldn't build, because you don't have time.

Maybe you can build some scrappy login system. For photo AI, you sign up, you pay with Stripe Checkout and you get a login link. And when I started out, there was only a login link with a hash, and that's just a static link, so it's very easy to log in. It's not so safe, what if you leak the link? And now I have real Google login, but that took a year. So keeping it very scrappy is very important to ... because you don't have time. You need to focus on what you can build fast. So money, Stripe, build a product, build a landing page. You need to think about, \"How are people going to find this?\" So are you going to put it on Reddit or something? How are you going to put it on Reddit without being looked at as a spammer? If you say, \"Hey, it is my new startup, you should use it,\" no, nobody ... It gets deleted. Maybe if you find a problem that a lot of people on Reddit already have, on a subreddit and you solve that problem, say, \"What's up, people. I made this thing that might solve your problem,\" and maybe, \"It's free for now.\" That could work. But you need to be very ... Narrow it down, what you're building.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Time is limited. Actually, can we go back to the you laying in a room feeling like a loser, I still feel like a loser sometimes. Can you speak to that feeling, to that place of just feeling like a loser? Because I think a lot of people in this world are laying in a room right now listening to this and feeling like a loser.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay. So I think it's normal if you're young that you feel like a loser, first of all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Especially when you're 27.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a peak.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. I think 27 is the peak. And so I would not kill yourselves, it's very important. Just get through it. But because you have nothing, you have probably no money, you have no business, you have no job. Jordan Peterson said this. I saw it somewhere, \"The reason people are depressed is because they have nothing. They don't have a girlfriend, they don't have or boyfriend, they don't have ...\" You need stuff, or a family. You need things around you. You need to build a life for yourself. If you don't build a life for yourself, you'll be depressed. So if you're alone in Asia in a hostel looking at the ceiling and you don't have any money coming in, you don't have a girlfriend, you don't ... of course you're depressed. It's logic. But back then, if you're in the moment you think, \"This is not logic, there's something wrong with me.\" And also I think I started getting anxiety and I think I started going a little bit crazy where I think travel can make you insane. And I know this because I know that there's digital nomads that ... they kill themselves. And I haven't checked the comparison with baseline people suicide rate, but I have a hunch, especially in the beginning when it was a very new thing 10 years ago, that it can be very psychologically taxing, and you're alone a lot. Back then when you travel alone, there was no other digital moments back then, a lot. So you're in a strange culture, you look different than everybody. I was in Asia, everybody's really nice in Thailand, but you're not part of the culture. You're traveling around, you're hopping from city to city. You don't have a home anymore. You feel disrooted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're constantly an outcast in that you're different from everybody else.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, exactly. But people treat you ... Like Thailand, people are so nice, but you still feel like a outcast. And then I think the digital nomads I met then were all ... it was shady business. They were vigilantes, because it was a new thing. And one guy was selling illegal drugs. It was an American guy, was selling illegal drugs via UPS to Americans on this website, there were a lot of drop shippers doing shady stuff. There was a lot of shady things going on there. And they didn't look like very balanced people. They didn't look like people I wanted to hang with. So I also felt outcast from other foreigners in Thailand, other digital nomads. And I was like, \"Man, I made a big mistake.\" And then I went back to Holland and then I got even more depressed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said digital nomad. What is digital nomad? What is that way of life? What is the philosophy there? And the history of the movement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I struck upon it on accident, because I was like, \"I'm going to graduate university and then I need to get out of here. I'll fly to Asia,\" because I'd been before in Asia. I studied in Korea in 2009, study exchange. So I was like, \"Asia is easy, Thailand's easy. I'll just go there, figure things out.\" And it's cheap. It's very cheap. Chiang Mai, I would live for $150 per month rent for private room, pretty good. So I struck upon this on accident. I was like, \"Okay, there's other people on laptops working on their startup or working remotely.\" Back then nobody worked remotely, but they worked on their businesses, and they would live in Columbia or Thailand or Vietnam or Bali. They would live in more cheap places. And it looked like a very adventurous life. You travel around, you build your business, there's no pressure from your home society. You're American, so you get pressure from American society telling you what to do, \"You need to buy a house,\" or \"You need to do this stuff.\" I had this in Holland too. And you can get away from this pressure, and you can feel like you're free. There's nobody telling you what to do. But that's also why you start feeling like you go crazy, because you are free, you're disattached from anything and anybody. You're disattached from your culture, you're disattached from the culture you're probably in because you're staying very short.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think Franz Kafka said, \"I'm free, therefore I'm lost.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, that's so true. That's exactly the point. And freedom, it's the definition of no constraints. Anything is possible, you can go anywhere. And everybody's like, \"Oh, that must be super nice. Freedom, you must be very happy.\" And it's the opposite. I don't think that makes you happy. I think constraints probably make you happy. And that's a big lesson I learned then.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But what were they making for money?

And I think you balance on this edge of anxiety, because this caffeine is also hitting your anxiety and you want to be on the edge of anxiety with this techno running. Sometimes it gets too much, it's like, \"Stop the techno, stop the music.\" But those are good memories. And also travel memories. You go from city to city and it feels like it's jet set life.

Right now Elon's trying to make X this everything app like WeChat, same thing.

You can go back to your country and build that same app for your country for example. So, you start seeing problems, you start seeing solutions that other people already did in the rest of the world, and also traveling in general just gives you more problems, because travel is uncomfortable.

When Stable Diffusion came or ChatGPT and stuff, all these things were like... I didn't start working with them, because I had a problem. I had no problems, but I was very curious about technology, and I was playing with it, and figuring out...

The faces look all mangled, and it doesn't have enough resolution or something to do that well, but I started seeing these base models, these fine-tuned models, and people would train on porn, and I would try them, and they would be very photorealistic. They would have bodies that actually made sense, like body anatomy, but if you look at the photorealistic models that people use now, there's still core of porn there, like of naked people. So, I need to prompt out, and everybody needs to do this with AI startups, with imaging, you need to prompt out the naked stuff.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's like software developers if you want to get a job, and there's people making stuff, like startups, and if you want to be entrepreneur, probably you maybe shouldn't, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I really want to measure performance and speed. I think there's a deep wisdom in that. I do think that frameworks and just constantly wanting to learn the new thing, this complicated way of software engineering gets in the way. I'm not sure what to say about that, because definitely you shouldn't build everything from just vanilla JavaScript or vanilla C for example, C++ when you're building systems engineering is like... There's a lot of benefits for a pointer safety, and all that kind of stuff.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, this is my most controversial take, I think, and maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like this frameworks now that raise money, they raise a lot of money. They raise 50 million, 100 million, $200 million, and the idea is that you need to make the developers, and new developers, like when you're 18 or 20 years old, get them to use this framework, and add a platform to it where the framework can... It's open source, but you probably should use the platform, which is paid to use it, and the cost of the platforms to host it are 1,000 times higher than just hosting it on a simple AWS server or VPS on DigitalOcean. So, there's obviously a monetary incentive here. We want to get a lot of developers to use this technology, and then we need to charge them money, because they're going to use it in startups, and then the startups can pay for the bills. It kind of destroys the information out there about learning to code, because they pay YouTubers, they pay developer influencers a big thing to... And same thing what happens with nutrition and fitness or something, same thing happens in developing. They pay this influencer to promote this stuff, use it, make stuff with it, make demo products with it, and then a lot of people are like, \"Wow, use this.\" And I started noticing this, because when I would ship my stuff, people would ask me, \"What are you using?\" I would say, \"Just PHP, jQuery. Why does it matter?\" And people would start attacking me like, \"Why are you not using this new technology, this new framework, this new thing?\" And I say, \"I don't know, because this PHP thing works, and I don't really optimizing for anything. It just works.\" And I never understood why... I understand there's new technologies that are better and it should be improvement, but I'm very suspicious of money, just like lobbying. There's money in this developer framework scene. There's hundreds of millions that goes to ads or influencer or whatever. It can't all go to developers. You don't need so many developers for a framework, and it's open source to make a lot of more money on these startups.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, that's a really good perspective, but in addition to that is when you say better, it's like, can we get some data on the better? Because I want to know from the individual developer perspective, and then from a team of five, team of 10, team of 20 developers measure how productive they are in shipping features, how many bugs they create, how many security holes result-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it started, because Stable Diffusion came out. So Stable Diffusion like this... The first generative image AI model, and I started playing with it. You could install on your Mac... Somebody forked it and made it work for MacBooks. So, I downloaded it and cloned the repo, and started using it to generate images, and it was amazing. I found it on Twitter, because you see things happen on Twitter, and I would post what I was making on Twitter as well, and you could make any image. So, essentially you write a prompt, and then it generates a photo of that or image of that in any style. They would use artist names to make like a Picasso kind of style and stuff, and I was trying to see, what is it good at? Is it good at people? No, it's really bad at people, but it was good at houses, so architecture for example, I would generate architecture houses. So, I made a website called thishousedoesnotexist.org, and it generated... They called like house porn at that one. Houseporn is like a subreddit, and this was Stable Diffusion, like the first version. So it looks really... You can click for another photo. So, it generates all these non-existing houses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is house porn.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it looked kind of good, especially back then.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It looks really good.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it also generates a description.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can upvote... Is it nice? Upvote it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Man, there's so much to talk to you about. The choices here is really well done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is very scrappy. In the bottom, there's like a ranking of the most upvoted houses.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was really popular for a while, but then people got so bored of it. I think, because I was getting bored of it, too, just continuous house porn, everything starts looking the same, but then I saw it was really good at interior, so I pivoted to interiorai.com, where I tried to upload first generate interior designs, and then I tried to do... There was a new technology called image-to-image where you can input an image, like a photo, and it would kind of modify the thing. So, you see it looks almost the same as Photo AI. It's the same code essentially.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, I would upload a photo of my interior where I lived, and I would ask like, \"Change this into, I don't know, maximalist design,\" and it worked and it worked really well. So I was like, \"Okay, this is a startup,\" because obviously interior design AI, and nobody's doing that yet. So, I launched this and I was successful and within a week, made 10K, 20K a month, and now still makes like 40K, 50K a month, and it's been like two years. So then I was like, \"How can I improve this interior design? I need to start learning fine-tuning.\" And fine-tuning is where you have this existing AI model and you fine tune it on the specific goal you wanted to do. So, I would find really beautiful interior design, make a gallery, and train a new model that was very good at interior design, and it worked, and I used that as well. And then for fun, I uploaded photos of myself, and here's where it happened, and to train myself. And this would never work, obviously, and it worked, and actually it started understanding me as a concept. So, my face worked and you could do different styles, like me as a... Very cheesy, medieval warrior, all this stuff. So I was like, \"This is another startup.\" So, now I did avatarai.me. I couldn't get the dot com, and this was [inaudible 00:52:01]-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it still up?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I was a little bit sad, because all my products would work out, and I never had real fierce competition, and now I have fierce competition from a very skilled high talent. I was developer studio or something, and they already had an app. They had an app in the app store for I think retouching your face or something, so they were very smart. They add these avatars to there, it's a feature. They had the users, they do a push notification to everybody who have these avatars. Man, I think they made so much money, and I think they did a really great job, and I also made a lot of money with it, but I quickly realized it wasn't my thing, because it was so cheesy. It was like kitsch. It's kind like me as a Barbie or me as a... It was too cheesy. I wanted to go for, what's a real problem we can solve? This is going to be a hype, this going to be... And it was a hype, these avatars. It's like, \"Let's do real photography. How can you make people look really photorealistic?\" And it was difficult, and that's why these avatars worked, because they were all in a cheesy Picasso style, and art is easy, because you interpret... All the problems that AI has with your face are artistic if you call it Picasso, but if you make a real photo, all the problems of your face, you look wrong. So, I started making Photo AI, which was a pivot of it where it was like a photo studio where you could take photos without actually needing a photographer, needing a studio. You just type it, and I've been working on it for the last year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's really incredible. That journey is really incredible.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly, I would imagine that, too, when I started. I was like, \"Oh, this must be some 3D scan technology,\" right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, I think the cool thing with AI, it trains the concept of you. So, it's literally learning just like any AI model learns. It learns how you look, so I did this and then I was getting DMs, like Telegram messages like, \"How can I do the same thing? I want these photos, my girlfriend wants these photos.\" So I was like, \"Okay, this is obviously a business,\" but I didn't have time to code it, make a whole app about it. So, I made an HTML page, registered a domain name, and this not even... It was a Stripe payment link, which means you have literally a link to Stripe to pay, but there's no code in the back. So, all you know is you have customers that paid money. Then, I added a Typeform link. So, Typeform is a site where you can create your own input form, like Google Forms. So, they would get an email with a link to the Typeform or actually just a link after the checkout, and they could upload their photos, so enter their email, upload the photos, and I launched it, and I was like... Here, first still, so it's October 2022, and I think within the first 24 hours was like... I'm not sure, it was like 1,000 customers or something, but the problem was I didn't have code to automate this, so I had to do it manually. So the first few hundred, I just literally took their photos, trained them, and then I would generate the photos with the prompts, and I had this text file with the prompt, and I would do everything manually, and it quickly became way too much, but that's another constraint. I was forced to code something up that would do that, and that was essentially making it into a real website.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, at first it was the Typeform and they uploaded it through the Typeform-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a Stripe checkout Typeform.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>An image, and then you were like, \"That image is downloaded.\" Did you write a script to export, like download [inaudible 00:58:21]-<|eot_id|>"}

So, what's the AI component? How hard was that to figure out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, so that's actually in many ways the easiest thing, because there is all these platforms already back then. There was platforms for fine tune Stable Diffusion. Now, I use Replicate, back then I used different platforms, which was funny because that platform, when this thing took off, I would tweet... Because I tweet always like how much money these websites make, and then... So, you call it vendor, right? The platform that did the GPUs, they increased their price for training from $3 to $20 after they saw that I was making so much money. So, immediately my profit is gone, because I was selling them for $30, and I was in a Slack with them saying, \"What is this? Can you just put it back to $3?\" They say, \"Yeah, maybe in the future. We're looking at it right now.\" I'm like, \"What are you talking about? You just took all my money,\" and they're smart.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, they're not that smart, because you also have a large platform, and a lot of people respect you, so you can literally come out and say that, but they're not-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but I think it's kind of dirty to cancel a company or something. I prefer just bringing my business elsewhere, but there was no elsewhere back then.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, I started talking to other AI model, ML platforms. So, Replicate was one of those platforms, and I started DMing the CEO say, \"Can you please create...\" It's called DreamBooth, this fine-tuning of yourself. \"Can you add this to your site, because I need this, because I'm being price gauged?\" And he said, \"No, because it takes too long to run. It takes half an hour to run and we don't have the GPUs for it.\" I said, \"Please, please, please.\" And then after a week, he said, \"We're doing it, we're launching this.\" And then this company became... It was not very famous company, it became very famous with this stuff, because suddenly everybody was like, \"Oh, we can build similar avatar apps,\" and everybody started building avatar apps and everybody started using Replicate for it, and that was from these early DMs with the CEO, like Ben Firsh, very nice guy. And he was like... They never price-gauged me, they never treated me bad, they always been very nice. It's a very cool company. So, you can run any ML model, any AI model, LLMs, you can run on here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can scale-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, they scale. Yeah, yeah, and I mean you can do now, you can click on the model and just run it already. It's like super easy.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly, and I didn't know how it worked, but I knew that they could probably do this and they did it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think people... Well, man, that's another thing, people don't know how they look. So, they generate photos of themselves and then they say, \"Ah, it doesn't look like me,\" but you can check the training photos, it does look like you, but you don't know how you look. So, there's a face dysmorphia of yourself that you have no idea how you look.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's hilarious. I mean, I've got... One of the least pleasant activities in my existence is having to listen to my voice and look at my face.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Really?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have a distorted view perspective.<|eot_id|>"}

I'm like, \"This is super ugly.\" But then they're like, \"No, that's how you look, and you look nice.\" So, how other people see you is nice. So, you need to ask other people to choose your photos. You shouldn't choose them yourself, because you don't know how you look.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you don't know what makes you interesting, what makes you attractive, or all this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

This is a dark aspect of psychology, we focus on some- And a lot of us, this is a dark aspect of psychology, we focus on some small flaws. This is why I hate plastic surgery, for example. People try to remove the flaws when the flaws are the thing that makes you interesting and attractive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I learned from the hammerhead shark eyes, the stuff about you that looks ugly to you, and it's probably what makes you original, makes you nice, and people like it about you. And it's not like, \"Oh, my god.\" And people notice it, people notice your hammerhead eyes, but it's like, \"That's me. That's my face. So, I love myself.\" And that's confidence, and confidence is attractive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Confidence is attractive. But yes, understanding what makes you beautiful. It's the breaking of symmetry makes you beautiful, it's the breaking of the average face makes you beautiful, all of that. And obviously different from men and women of different ages, all this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, a hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But underneath it all, the personality, all of that, when the face comes alive, that also is the thing that makes you beautiful. But anyway, you have to figure all that out with AI.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. One thing that worked was, people would upload full body photos of themselves, so I would crop the face, right? Then the model knew better that we're training mostly the face here. But then I started losing resemblance of the body 'cause some people are skinny, some people are muscular, whatever. So, you want to have that too. So, now, I mix full body photos in the training with face photos, face crops, and it's all automatic. And I know that other people, they use, again, AI models to detect what are the best photos in this training set and then train on those. It's all about training data, and it's with everything in AI, how good your training data is, in many ways, more important than how many steps you train for, like how many months, or whatever, with these GPUs. The goals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you have any guidelines for people of how to get good data, how to give good data to fine tune on?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The photos should be diverse. So, for example, if I only upload photos with a brown shirt or green shirts, the model will think that I'm training the green shirts. So, the things that are the same every photo are the concepts that are trained. What you want is your face to be the concept that's trained and everything else to be diverse different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, diverse lighting as well. Diverse everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, outside, inside. But there's no, this is the problem, there's no manual for this. And nobody knew. We were all just, especially two years ago, we're all hacking, trying to test anything, anything you can think of. And it's frustrating. It's one of the most frustrating and also fun and challenging things to do because with AI, because it's a black box. And Karpathy, I think, says this, \"We don't really know how this thing works, but it does something, but nobody really knows why.\" We cannot look into the model of an LLM, what is actually in there. We just know it's a treaty matrix of numbers, right? So, it's very frustrating because some things that would be, you think they're obvious that they will improve things, will make them worse. And there's so many parameters you can tweak. So, you're testing everything to improve things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean there's a whole field now of mechanistic interpretability that studies that tries to figure out, tries to break things apart and understand how it works. But there's also the data side and the actual consumer-facing product side of figuring out how you get it to generate a thing that's beautiful or interesting or naturalistic, all that kind of stuff. And you're at the forefront of figuring that out about the human face. And humans really care about the human face.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In very vain. Like me, I want to look good in your podcast, for example. Yeah, for sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then one of the things actually would love to rigorously use photo AI, because for the thumbnails, I take portraits of people. I don't know shit about photography. I basically used your approach for photography like Googled, \"How do you take photographs? Camera, lighting.\" And also it's tough because maybe you could speak to this also, but with photography, no offense to any, they're true artists, great photographers, but people take themselves way too seriously. Think you need a whole lot of equipment. You definitely don't want one light, you need five lights...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, I know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you have to have the lenses.

Focus on whatever the problems are, use your own judgment, use your own instincts, don't listen to other people, and only consult other people when there's a specific problem. And you consult them not to offload the problem onto them, but to gain wisdom from their perspective. Even if their perspective is ultimately one you don't agree with, you're going to gain wisdom from that. And just, I ultimately come up with a PHP solution, PHP and jQuery solution to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>PHP studio.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The PHP studio. I have a little suitcase. I use just the basic consumer type of stuff. One light. It's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And look at you, you're one of the top podcasts in the world, and you get millions of views, and it works. And the people that spend so much money on optimizing for the best sound, for the best studio, they get 300 views. So, what is this about? This is about that. Either you do it really well or also that a lot of these things don't matter. What matters is probably the content of the podcast. You get the interesting guest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Focus on the stuff that matters.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And I think that's very common. They call it gear acquisition syndrome, like GAS, people in any industry do this. They just buy all the stuff. There was a meme recently. What's the name for the guy that buys all the stuff before you even started doing the hobby, right? Marketing. Marketing does that to people. They want you to buy this stuff. But man, you can make a Hollywood movie on an iPhone if the content is good enough. And it will probably be original because you would be using an iPhone for it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, the reason I brought that up with photography, there is wisdom from people. And one of the things I realized, you probably also realized this, but how much power light has to convey emotion. Just take one light and move it around, says you sit in the darkness, move it around your face. The different positions are having a second life potentially. You can play with how a person feels just from a generic face. It's interesting. You can make people attractive, you can make them ugly, you can make them scary, you can make them lonely, all of this. And so you start to realize this. And I would definitely love AI help in creating great portraits of people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Guest photos. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Guest photos, for example, that's a small use case, but for me... I suppose it's an important use case because I want people to look good, but I also want to capture who they are. Maybe my conception of who they are, what makes them beautiful, what makes their appearance powerful in some ways. Sometimes it's the eyes, oftentimes it's the eyes, but there's certain features of the face can sometimes be really powerful. It's also awkward for me to take photographs, so I'm not collecting enough photographs for myself to do it with just those photographs. If I can load that off onto AI and then start to play with lighting, all that kind of stuff-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You should do this and you should probably do it yourself. You can use photo AI, but it's even more fun if you do it yourself.

So, you can create a control net face pose that's always like this. So, every model, every photo you generate uses this control net pose, for example. I think would be very fun for you to try out that stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you play with lighting at all? Do you play with lighting pose with the...<|eot_id|>"}

There's, for sure, a lot of stuff you can do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your advice for people in general on how to learn all the state-of-the-art AI tools available, like you mentioned new model's coming out all the time.

They get hired by big companies and they're on X. And most of them are anonymous. It's very funny. They use anime avatars. I don't.

And so if you want to start going on X, and then I would go to replicate and start trying to play with models. And when you have something that you manually enter stuff, you set the parameters, something that works, you can make an app out of it or a website.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you speak a little bit more to the process of it becoming better and better and better, photo AI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, I had this photo AI and a lot of people using it. There was like a million or more photos a month being generated. And I discovered I was testing parameters, increase the step count of generating photo or changing the sampler, like a scheduler. You have DPM tools, all these things I don't know anything about, but I know that you can choose them and you generate image and they have different resulting images. But I didn't know which one were better. So, I would do it myself, test it, but then I was like, \"Why don't I test on these users?\" 'Cause I have a million photos generated anyway, so on like 10% of the users, I would randomly test parameters and then I would see if they would, because you can favor the photo or you can download it, I would measure if they favor it or like the photo. And then I would A/B test and you test for significance and stuff, which parameters were better and which were worse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you starting to figure out which models are actually working well.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And then if it's significant enough data, you switch to that for all the users. And so that was the breakthrough to make it better. Just use the users to improve themselves. And I tell them when they sign up, \"We do sampling, we do testing on your photos with random parameters.\" And that worked really well. I don't do a lot of testing anymore because I reached a diminishing point where it's good, but there was a breakthrough. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, it's really about the parameters, the models, and letting the users help do the search in the space of models and parameters for you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But actually, so Stable Diffusion, I used 1.5, 2.0 came out as Stable Diffusion, Excel came out, all these new versions, and they were all worse. And so the core scene of people are still using 1.5 because it's also not like what do you call \"neutered.\" They neutered to make it super with safety features and stuff. So, most of the people are still on Stable Diffusion 1.5. And meanwhile Stable Diffusion, the company went, the CEO left. A lot of drama happened because they couldn't make money. They gave us this open source model that everybody uses. They raised hundreds of millions of dollars. They didn't make any money with. There are not lots. And they did an amazing job, and now everybody uses open source model for free and it's amazing. It's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're not even using the latest one, you're saying?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, and the strange thing is that this company raised hundreds of millions, but the people that are benefiting from it, early, small, people like me who make these small apps that are using the model. And now they're starting to charge money for the new models, but the new models are not so good for people. They're not so open source, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It is interesting because open source is so impactful in the AI space, but you wonder what is the business model behind that? But it's enabling this whole ecosystem of companies that they're using the open source models.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, it's like those frameworks, but then they didn't bribe enough influence to use it and they didn't charge money for the platform.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, back to your book and the ideas, you didn't even get to the first step, generating ideas. So, you had no book and you're filling it up. How do you know when an idea is a good one? You have this just flood of ideas. How do you pick the one that you actually try to build?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, mostly you don't know. Mostly I choose the ones that are most viable for me to build.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I think asteroid mining would be very cool because you go to an asteroid, you take some stuff from there, you bring it back, you sell it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, I saw some YouTubers doing this like... There's a lot of these productivity gurus also and they do this whole iPad with a pencil.

And I'm like, \"Dude, I did this for a week. And then I'm like, 'What am I doing in my life?' I can just write it as a message to myself and it's good enough.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of ideas, you shared a tweet explaining why the first idea sometimes might be a brilliant idea. The reason for this you think is the first idea submerges from your subconscious and was actually boiling your brain for weeks, months, sometimes years in the background. The eight hours of thinking can never compete with a perpetual subconscious background job. So, this is the idea that if you think about an idea for eight hours versus the first idea that pops into your mind. And sometimes there is subconscious stuff that you've been thinking about for many years. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean like, \"It emerges.\" I wrote it wrong because I'm not native English, but it emerges from your subconscious, it comes from like a water.

And there you have your idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think you have ideas like that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, all the time. A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just stuff that's been there.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it's like a soup of ideas that's cooking. It's a hundred percent. This is how my brain works, and I think most people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's also about the timing. Sometimes you have to send it back, not just because you're not ready, but the world is not ready.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, many times, like startup founders are too early with their idea. Yeah, a hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Robotics is an interesting one for that because there's been a lot of robotics companies that failed, because it's been very difficult to build a robotics company make money 'cause there's the manufacturing, the cost of everything. The intelligence of the robot is not sufficient to create a compelling enough product from wish to make money. There's this long line of robotics companies that have tried, they had big dreams, and they failed.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, like Boston Dynamics. I still don't know what they're doing, but they always upload YouTube videos and it's amazing.

It's fun, but it doesn't really solve anything yet. I feel the same with VR. It's really cool. Apple Vision Pro is very cool. It doesn't really solve something for me yet. And that's the tech looking for a solution, but one day will.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When the personal computer, when the Mac came along, there was a big switch that happened. It somehow captivated everybody's imagination. The application, the killer apps became apparent. You can type in a computer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But they became apparent immediately. Back then they also had this thing where like, \"We don't need these computers. They're like a hype.\" And it also went in like waves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But the hype is the thing that allowed the thing to proliferate sufficiently to where people's minds would start opening up to it a little bit, the possibility of it. Right now, for example, with the robotics, there's very few robots in the homes of people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The robots that are there are Roombas, so the vacuum cleaners, or they're Amazon Alexa.<|eot_id|>"}

That's just one example. I sometimes think about that as if some people in this world were born in the whole existence is like, they were meant to build the thing. I sometimes wonder what I was meant to do. You have these plans for your life, you have these dreams?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think you're meant to build robots.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Me personally. Maybe. Maybe. That's a sense I've had, but it could be other things. Hilariously not be the thing I was meant to be is to talk to people, which is weird because I always was anxious about talking to people.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but that's also kind of life, like life brings you to, it's very hard to super intently choose what you're going to do with your life. It is more like surfing. You're surfing the waves, you go in the ocean, you see where you end up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And there's universe has a kind of sense of humor.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess you have to just allow yourself to be carried away by the waves.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, all the time. Yeah. I think that's the best way to live your life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, a allow of whatever to happen. Do you know what you're doing in the next few years? Is it possible that it'll be completely changed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Possibly. I think relationships, you want to hold the relationships, right? You want hold your girl and you want her to become wife and all this stuff. But I think you should stay open to where, for example, where you want to live. We don't know where we want to live, for example. That's something that will figure itself out. It will crystallize where you will get sent by the waves to somewhere where you want to live, for example. What you're going to do? I think that's a really good way to live your life. I think most stress comes from trying to control, like hold things. It's kind of Buddhist. You need to lose control, let it lose. And then things will happen. When you do mushrooms, when you do drugs, like psychedelic drugs, the people that start, that are control freaks, get bad trips, right? 'Cause you need to let go. I'm pretty control freak actually. And when I did mushrooms when I was 17, it was very good. And then at the end it wasn't so good 'cause I tried to control it. It was like, \"Ah, now it's going too much. Now, I need to... Let's stop.\" Bro, you can't stop it. You need to go through with it. And I think it's a good metaphor for life. I think that's a very tranquil way to lead you life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, actually when I took ayahuasca, that lesson is deeply within me already that you can't control anything. I think I probably learned that the most in jiu-jitsu. So, just let go and relax. And that's why I had just an incredible experience. There's literally no negative aspect of my ayahuasca experience, or any psychedelics I've ever had. Some of that could be with my biology and my genetics, whatever, but some of it was just not trying to control. Just surf the waves.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. For sure. I think most stress in life comes from trying to control.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, once you have the idea, step two, build. How do you think about building the thing once you have the idea?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think you should build with the technology that you know. So, for example, Nomad List, which is like this website I made to figure out the best cities to live and work as digital nomads, it wasn't a website. It launched as a Google spreadsheet. So, it was a public Google spreadsheet anybody could edit. And I was like, \"I'm collecting cities where we can live as these nomads with the internet speeds, the cost of living, other stuff.\" And I tweeted it. And back then, I didn't have a lot of followers. I have a few thousand followers or something. And I went viral for my skill viral back then, which was five retweets and a lot of people started editing it. And there was hundreds of cities in this list from all over the world with all the data. It was very crowdsourced. And then I made that into a website. So, figuring out what technology you can use, that you already know. So, if you cannot code, you can use spreadsheet. If you cannot use a spreadsheet, whatever, you can always use, for example, a website generator like Wix or something, or Squarespace, right? You don't need to code to build a startup. All you need is an idea for a product, build something like a landing page or something, put a Stripe button on there, and then make it. And if you can code, use the language that you already know and start coding with that and see how far you can get. And you can always rewrite the code later. The tech stack it's not the most important of a business when you're starting out a business. The important thing is that you validate that there's a market, that there's a product that people want to pay for. So, use whatever you can use. And if you cannot code, use spreadsheets, landing page generators, whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the crowdsourcing element is fascinating. It's cool. It's cool when a lot of people start using it. You get to learn so fast. I've actually did the spreadsheet thing. You share a spreadsheet publicly, and I made it editable.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Interesting things start happening.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I did it for a workout thing 'cause I was doing a large amount of pushups and pull ups every day.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I remember this man. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>While it's like Google Sheets is pretty limited in that everything's allowed. So, people could just write anything in any cell and they can create new sheets, new tabs, and it just exploded. And one of the things that I really enjoyed is there's very few trolls because actually other people would delete the trolls. There would be this weird war of like, they want to protect the thing. It's an immune system that's inherent to the thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, I was traveling and I was still trying to find problems, and I would discover that everybody's experience of a city is different because they stay in different areas. So, I'm from Amsterdam and when I grew up in Amsterdam, or I didn't grow up, but I lived there in university, I knew that center is like, in Europe, the centers are always tourist areas, so they're super busy. They're not very authentic, they're not really Dutch culture, it's Amsterdam tourist culture. So, when people would travel to Amsterdam I would say, \"Don't go to the center, go to southeast of the center, the Jordaan or the Pijp or something.\" More hipster areas. I was like, \"A little more authentic culture of Amsterdam.\" That's where I would live and where I would go. And I thought this could be an app where you can have a Google Maps and you put colors over it. You have areas that are like color-coded, like red is tourist, green is rich, green money, yellow is hipster. And you can figure out where you need to go in the city when you travel. 'Cause I was traveling a lot, I wanted to go to the cool spots.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, just use color.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Color. Yeah. And I would use a canvas. So, I thought, okay, what do I need? I need to...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you know that you would be using a canvas?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I didn't know it was possible 'cause I didn't know-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is the cool thing. People should really check it out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is how it started.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because you're honestly capture so beautifully the humbling aspects or the embarrassing aspects of not knowing what to do. It's like, \"How do I do this?\" And you document yourself. Yeah, you're right, \"Dude, I feel embarrassed about myself.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, really? Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's called being alive. Nice. So, you don't know anything about Canvas is HTML5 thing that allows you to draw shapes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Draw images, just draw pixels essentially. And that was special back then because before you could only have elements, right? So, you want to draw a pixel, use a Canvas. And I knew I needed to draw pixels 'cause I need to draw these colors. And I felt like, okay, I'll get a Google Maps, I frame Embeds, and then I put a div on top of it with the colors. And I'll do opacity 50, so it kind of shows. So, I did that with Canvas, and then I started drawing. And then I felt like obviously other people need to edit this 'cause I cannot draw all these things myself. So, I crowdsourced it again. And you would draw on the map and then it would send the pixel data to the server. It would put it in the database. And then I would have a robot running like a cron job, which every week would calculate, or every day would calculate like, \"Okay, so Amsterdam Center, there's like six people say it's tourists, this part of the center, but two people say it's like hipster. Okay, so the tourist part wins, right?\" It's just an array. So, find the most common value in a little pixel area on a map. So, if most people say it's tourists, it's tourists, and it becomes red. And I would do that for all the GPS corners in the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we just clarify, as a human that's contributing to this, do you have to be in that location to make the label or do you-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, they drew crazy stuff, like offensive symbols. I mentioned they would draw penises.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean that's obviously a guy thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would do the same thing, draw penises.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When I show up to Mars and there's no cameras, I'm drawing a penis on the same-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. Man, I did it in the snow. But the penises did not become a problem 'cause I knew that not everybody would draw a penis and not in the same place. So, most people would use it fairly. So, just say if I had enough crowdsource data, so you have all these pixels on top of each, it's like a layer of pixels, and you choose the most common pixel. So, yeah, it's just like a poll, but in visual format. And it worked. And within a week, I'd had enough data. And it was like cities that did really well, like Los Angeles, a lot of people started using it. Like most data's in Los Angeles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because Los Angeles has defined neighborhoods.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean obviously it's simplified, but you need to simplify this stuff. You don't want to have too many categories. And it's essentially like using a paintbrush, where you select the color in the bottom, you select the category and you start drawing. There's no instruction. There's no manual. And then I also add a tagging so people could write something on a specific location, so, \"Don't go here,\" or like, \"Here's nice cafes and stuff.\" And man, the memes that came from that. And I also added uploading so that the tags could be uploaded. So, the memes that came from that is amazing. People in Los Angeles would write crazy stuff. It would go viral in all these cities. You can allow your location, and then we'll probably send you to Austin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so we're looking... Oh, boy. \"Drunk hipsters.\"<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we're now looking at an image where it's just a sea of pixels that are colored different colors in a city. So how do you combine that to be a thing that actually makes some sense?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think here the problem was that you have this data but it's not locked to one location.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I had to normalize it. So when you draw on the map, it'll show you the specific pixel location and you can convert the pixel location to a GPS coordinate like latitudes, longitudes. But the number will have a lot of commas or a lot of decimals because it's very specific. It's like this specific part of the table. So what you want to do is you want to take that pixel and you want to normalize it by removing decimals, which I discovered, so that you're talking about this neighborhood or this street. So that's what I did. I just took the decimals off and then I saved it like this and then it starts going to a grid and then you have a grid of data. You get a pixel map kind of.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you said it looks kind of ugly so then you smooth it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I started adding blurring and stuff. I think now it's not smooth again because I liked it better. People like the pixel look. Yeah, a lot of people use it and it keeps going viral and every time my maps bill like Map Box, I had to stop using... I first used Google Maps. It went viral and Google Maps, it was out of credits and I had to... So funny, when I launched, it went viral, the map didn't load anymore. It says over the limits. You need to contact enterprise sales. And I'm like, \"But I need now a map and I don't want to contact enterprise sales. I don't want to go on a call schedule with some calendar.\" So I switched to Map Box and then had Map Box for years and then it went viral and I had a bill of $20,000. It was last year. So they helped me with the bill. They said you can pay less. And then I now switched to an open source kind of map platform. So it's a very expensive product and never made any dollar money, but it's very fun but it's very expensive.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where do you learn from that experience? Because when you leverage somebody else's through the API.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I don't think a map hosting service should cost this much, but I could host it myself, but that would be... I don't know how to do that, but I could do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's super complicated.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that the thing is more about you can't make money with this project. I try to do many things to make money with it and it hasn't worked.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You talked about possibly doing advertisements on it or somehow or people sponsoring it. Yeah. But it's really surprising to me that people don't want to advertise on it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think map apps are very hard to monetize. Google Maps also doesn't really make money. Sometimes you see these ads, but I don't think there's a lot of money there. You could put a banner ad, but it's kind of ugly and the project, it's kind of cool. So it's kind of fun to subsidize it. It's a little bit part of Nomad List. I put it on Nomad List in the cities as well. But I also realized you don't need to monetize everything. Some products are just cool and it's cool to have hood maps exist. I want this to exist, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a bunch of stuff you've created that I'm just glad exists in this world. That's true. And it's a whole nother puzzle and I'm surprised to figure out how to make money off of it. I'm surprised maps don't make money, but you're right. It's hard. It's hard to make money because there's a lot of compute required to actually bring it to life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So where do you put the ad? If you have a website, you can put a ad box or you can do a product placement or something. But you're talking about a map app where 90% of the interface is a map. So what are you going to do? It's hard to figure out where is this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And people don't want to pay for it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, exactly because if you make people pay for it, you lose 99% of the user base and you lose the crowdsource data. So it's not fun anymore. It stops being accurate. So they pay for it by crowdsourcing the data, but then yeah, it's fine. It doesn't make money, but it's cool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that said, Nomad List makes money.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what was the story behind Nomad List?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So Nomad List started because I was in Chiang Mai in Thailand, which is now the second city here. And I was working on my laptop. I met other Nomads there and I was like, \"Okay, this seems like a cool thing to do, working on your laptop in a different country, kind of travel around.\" But back then the internet everywhere was very slow. So the internet was fast in, for example, Holland or United States, but in a lot of parts in South America or Asia, it was very slow like 0.5 megabits. So you couldn't watch a YouTube video. Thailand weirdly had quite fast internet, but I wanted to find other cities where I could go to work on my laptop, whatever and travel. But we needed fast internet, so I was like, \"Let's crowdsource this information with a spreadsheet.\" And I also needed to know the cost of living because I didn't have a lot of money. I had $500 a month. So I to find a place where the rent was $200 per month or something where I had some money that I could actually rent something and there was Nomad List and it still runs. I think it's now almost 10 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's just to describe how it works. I'm looking at Chiang Mai here. There's a total score. It's ranked number two.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's like a Nomad score.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>4.82 by members, but it's looking at the internet. In this case it's fast.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Fun, temperature, humidity, air quality, safety, food safety, crime, racism or lack of crime, lack of racism, educational level, power grid, vulnerability to climate change, income level.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a little much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>English. It's awesome. It's awesome. Walkability.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I keep adding stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because for certain groups of people, certain things really matter and this is really cool. Happiness. I'd love to ask you about that. Night life, free wifi, AC, female friendly, freedom of speech.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not so good in Thailand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Values derived from national statistics. I like how that one has-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I need to do that because the data sets are usually national. They're not on city level. So I don't know about the freedom of speech between Bangkok or Chiang Mai. I know them in Thailand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is really fascinating. So this is for city, is basically rating all the different things that matter to you, internet. And this is all crowdsourced.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, so it started crowdsource, but then I realized that you can download more accurate data sets from public source like World Bank. They have a lot of public data sets, United Nations and you can download a lot of data there, which you can freely use. I started getting problems across with data where for example, people from India, they really love India and they would submit the best scores for everything in India and not just one person, but a lot of people they would love to pump India. And I'm like, \"I love India too, but that's not valid data.\" So you started getting discrepancies in the data between where people were from and stuff. So I started switching to data sets and now it's mostly data sets, but one thing that's still crowdsourced is people add where they are, they add their travels to their profile and I use that data to see which places are upcoming and which places are popular now. So about half the ranking you see here is based on actual digital nomads who are there. You can click on a city, you can click on people and you can see the people, the users that are actually there. And it's like 30,000, 40,000 members. So these people are in Austin now and...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>1,800 remote workers in Austin now, of which eight plus members checked in, members who will be here soon and go... This is amazing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So we have meetups. So people organize their own meetups and we have about I think 30 per month. So it's like one meetup a day and I don't do anything. They organize themselves. So it's a whole black box, it just runs and I don't do a lot on it. It pulls data from everywhere and it just works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Cons of Austin is too expensive, very sweating, humid now, difficult to make friends.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Difficult to make friends. Interesting, right? I didn't know that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Difficult to make friends.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In Austin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But this all crowd source but mostly it's pros.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Austin's very good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pretty safe, fast internet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't understand why it says not safe for women. Check the data set. It feels safe. The problem with a lot of places like United States is that it depends per area.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So if you get city level data or nation level data, it's like Brazil is the worst because the range in safe and wealthy and not safe is huge. So you can't say many things about Brazil.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So once they actually show up to the city, how do you figure out what area, where to get fast internet? For example, for me it's consistently a struggle to figure out. Hotels with fast wifi, for example. Okay, okay. I show up to a city, there's a lot of fascinating puzzles and I haven't figured out a way to actually solve this puzzle. When I show up to a city, figuring out where I can get fast internet connection, and for podcasting purposes, where I can find a place with a table that's quiet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's not easy.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Before you arrive, you order an IKEA. Nomads do this.

Just the entire assembly, all that. Airbnb is so unreliable. The range in quality that you get is huge. Hotels have a lot of problems, pros and cons.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the booking fees, affiliate, right? I thought about this idea because we have the same problem. I go to hotels and there's specific ones that are very good and I know now the chains and stuff, but even if you go to... Some chains are very bad in a specific city and very good in other cities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And each individual hotel has a lot of kinds of rooms. Some are more expensive, some are cheaper and so on. But you can get the details of what's in the room, what's the actual layout of the room, what is the view of the room.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>3D scan it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel like as a hotel you can win a lot. So first you create a service that allows you to have high resolution data about a hotel. Then one hotel signs up for that. I would 100% use that website to look for a hotel instead of the crappy alternatives that don't give any information.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's the biggest booking website in the world. It's Dutch actually. And they have teams because my friend worked there. They have teams for a specific part of the website, like a 10 by 10 pixels area where they run tests on this. So they run tests and they're famous for this stuff like, \"Oh, there's only one room left,\" which is red letters like, \"One room left. Book now.\" And they got a fine from the European Union about this. Kind of interesting. So they have all these teams and they run the test for 24 hours. They go to sleep, they wake up next day, they come to the office and they see, \"Okay, this performed better.\" This website has become a monster, but it's the most revenue generating hotel booking website in the world. It's number one. So that shows that it's not about user experience. It's about, I don't know, about making more money and not every company, but if they're optimizing, it's a public company. If they're optimizing for money...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you can optimize for money by disrupting, making it way better.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but this always started... They start with disrupting. Booking all started as a startup, 1997, and then they become the old shit again. Uber now starts to become like a taxi again. It was very good in the beginning. Now it's kind like taxis now in many places are better. They're nicer than Ubers. So it's like the circle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think some of it is also just it's hard to have ultra competent engineers. Stripe seems like a trivial thing, but it's hard to pull off. Why was it so hard for Amazon to have buy with one click, which I think is a genius idea. Make buying easier. Make it as frictionless as possible.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>At Google.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's so many brilliant, brilliant people there, but it just moves slowly.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder why that is and maybe that's the natural way of a company, but you have people like Elon who rolls in and just fires most of the folks and always push the company to operate as a startup even when it's already big.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But Apple does this. I started in business school. Apple does competing product teams that operate as startups. So it's three to five people, they make something, they have multiple teams make the same thing. The best team wins. So I think you need to emulate a free market inside a company to make it entrepreneurial. And you need entrepreneurial mentality in a company to come up with new ideas and do it better.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the things you do really, really well is learn a new thing. You have an idea, you try to build it, and then you learn everything you need to in order to build it. You have your current skills, but you learn just the minimal amount of stuff. So you're a good person to ask how do you learn? How do you learn quickly and effectively and just the stuff you need? Just by way of example, you did a 30 days learning session on 3D where you documented yourself giving yourself only 30 days to learn everything you can about 3D.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I tried to learn virtual reality because this was same as AI. It came up suddenly 2016, 2017 with I think HTC Vive, these big VR glasses before Apple Vision Pro. And I was like, \"Oh, this is going to be big so I need to learn this.\" And I know nothing about 3D. I installed I think Unity and Blender and stuff, and I started learning all this stuff because I thought this was a new nascent technology that was going to be big. And if I had the skills for it, I could use this to build stuff. And so I think with learning, for me, I think learning is so funny because people always ask me, \"How do you learn to code? Should I learn to code?\" And I'm like, \"I don't know.\" Every day I'm learning. It's kind of cliche, but every day I'm learning new stuff. So every day I'm searching on Google or asking out ChatGPT how to do this thing, how to do this thing. Every day I'm getting better at my skill. So you never stop learning. So the whole concept of how do you learn, well, you never end. So where do you want to be? Do you want know a little bit? Do you want to know a lot? Do you want to do it for your whole life? So I think taking action is the best step to learn. So making things. You know nothing, just start making things. Okay, so how to make a website. Search how to make a website or nowadays you ask ChatGPT, \"How do I make a website? Where do I start?\" It generates codes for you. Copy the code, put it in a file, save it. Open it in Google Chrome or whatever. You have a website and then you start tweaking with it and you start, \"Okay, how do I add a button? How do I add AI features nowadays?\" So it's like by taking action, you can learn stuff much faster than reading books or tutorials.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually I'm always curious. Let me ask perplexity. How do I make a website? I'm just curious what it would say. I hope it goes with really basic vanilla solutions. Define your website's purpose, choose a domain name, select a web hosting provider. Choose a website, a builder or a CMS website. Build a platform. Wix.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Website builders are pretty advanced. All you need is a grid of images that are clickable that open another page.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can get quite far.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do I learn to program? Choose a programming language to start with.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's pretty good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I think it's a very good starting ground because imagine you know nothing and you want to make a website, you want to make a startup. That's why, man, the power of AI for education is going to be insane. People anywhere can ask this question and start building stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it clarifies it for sure. And just start building, keep build, build. Actually apply the thing, whether it's AI or any of the programming for web development. Just have a project in mind, which I love the idea of 12 startups in 12 months or build a project almost every day. Just build a thing and get it to work and finish it every single day. That's a cool experiment.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that was the inspiration. There was a girl who did 160 websites in 160 days or something, literally mini websites, and she learned to code that way. So I think it's good to set yourself challenges. You can go to some coding bootcamp, but I don't think they actually work. I think it's better to do for me out of the dark self-learning and setting yourself challenges and just getting in. But you need discipline. You need discipline to keep doing it. And coding, coding is very... It's a steep learning curve to get in. It's very annoying. Working with computers is very annoying, so it can be hard for people to keep doing it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. That thing of just keep doing it and don't quit, that urgency that's required to finish a thing. That's why it's really powerful when you documented this, the creation of Hood Maps or a working prototype that there's just a constant frustration, I guess. It's like, \"How do I do this?\" And then you look it up and you're like, \"Okay.\" You have to interpret the different options you have and then just try it. And then there's a dopamine rush of like, \"It works. Cool.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, it's amazing. And I live streamed it. It's on YouTube and stuff. People can watch it and it's amazing when things work. Look, it's just amazing that I don't look far ahead. So I only look, okay, what's the next problem to solve? And then the next problem. And at the end you have a whole app or website or thing. But I think most people look way too far ahead. It's like this poster again. You don't know hard it's going to be so you should only look for the next thing, the next little challenge, the next step, and then see where you end up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And assume it's going to be easy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. Be naive about it because you're going to have very difficult problems. A lot of the big problems won't be even technology, will be public. Maybe people don't like your website. You'll get canceled for a website for example. A lot of things can happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's it like building in public you do openly where you're just iterating quickly and you're getting people's feedback? So there's the power of the crowdsourcing, but there's also the negative aspects of people being able to criticize.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So man, I think haters are actually good because I think a lot of haters have good points and it takes stepping away from the emotion of your website sucks because blah, blah, blah. And you're like, \"Okay, just remove this.\" Your website sucks because personal. What did he say? Why did he not like it? And you figure out, okay, he didn't like it because the signup was difficult or something or the data. They say, no, this data is not accurate or something. I need to improve the quality of data. This hater has a point because it's dumb to completely ignore your haters. And also, man, I think I've been there when I was 10 years old or something. You're on the internet. You're just shouting crazy stuff. That's like most of Twitter or half of Twitter. So you have to take it with a grain of salt. Yeah, man, you need to grow a very thick skin on Twitter, on X. But I mute a lot of people. I found out I muted already 15,000 people recently. I checked,\\. So in 10 years I muted 15,000 people. So that's like...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's one by one manual?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So 1,500 people per year. And I don't like to block because then they get angry. They make a screenshot and they say, \"Ah, you blocked me.\" So I just mute and it disappear and it's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned Reddit. So Hood Maps, did that make it to the front page of Reddit?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah, it did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It did. It was amazing. And my server almost went down and I was checking Google Analytics was like 5,000 people on the website or something crazy. And it was at night and it was amazing. Man, I think nowadays, honestly, TikTok, YouTube reels, Instagram reels, a lot of apps get very big from people making TikTok videos about it. So let's say you make your own app, you can make a video for yourself like, \"Oh, I made this app. This is how it works, blah, blah, blah, and this is why I made it, for example, and this is why you should use it.\" And if it's a good video, it will take off and you will get... Man, I got $20,000 extra per month or something from one TikTok video. It made a photo guy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By you or somebody else by somebody else?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>By some random guy. So there's all these AI influencers that they write about. They show AI apps and then they ask money later when a video goes viral. All I can do, do it again and send me $4,000 or something. I'm like, \" Okay.\" I did that, for example. But it works. TikTok is a very big platform for user acquisition and organic. The best user acquisition I think is organic. You don't need to buy ads. You probably don't have money when you start to buy ads. So use organic or write a banger tweets that can make an app take off as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, yeah, fundamentally create cool stuff and have just a little bit of a following enough for the cool thing to be noticed. And then it becomes viral if it's cool enough.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And you don't need a lot of followers anymore on X and a lot of platforms because TikTok, X, I think it's Instagram reels also, they have the same algorithm now. It's not about followers anymore. It's about they test your content on a small subset, like 300 people. If they like, it'll get tested to a thousand people and on and on. So if the thing is good, it will rise anyway. It doesn't matter if you have half a million followers or a thousand followers or more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's your philosophy of monetizing, how to make money from the thing you build?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So a lot of starters, they do free users, so you could sign up and could use an app for free, which it never worked for me well because I think free users generally don't convert. And I think if you have VC funding, it makes sense to get free users because you can spend your funding on ads and you can get millions of people come in predictably how much they convert and give them a free trial, whatever, and then they sign up. But you need to have that flow worked out so well for you to make it work that you need... It's very difficult. I think it's best to start and just start asking people for money in the beginning. So show your app, what are you doing on your landing page. Make a demo, whatever, video. And then if you want to use it, pay me money. Pay $10, $20, $40. I would ask more than $10 per month like Netflix, $10 per month. But Netflix is giant company. They can afford to make it so cheap, relatively cheap. If you're an individual like an indie hacker, you are making your own app. You need to make at least $30 or more on a user to make it worth it for you. You need to make money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it builds a community of people that actually really care about the product.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Also, yeah, making a community like making a Discord is very normal now. Every AI app has a Discord and you have the developers and the users together in a Discord, and they ask for features. They build together. It's very normal now. And you need to imagine if you're starting out, getting a thousand users is quite difficult. Getting a thousand pages is quite difficult. And if you charge them like $30, you have 30K a month and it's a lot of money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's enough to...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Live a good life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, live a pretty good life. That could be a lot of costs associated with hosting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So that's another thing. I make sure my profit margins are very high, so I try to keep the costs very low. I don't hire people. I try to negotiate with AI vendors now like, \"Can you make it cheaper?\" Which I discovered this. You can just email companies and say, \"Can you give me discount? It's too expensive.\" And they say, \"Sure, 50%.\" I'm like, \"Wow, very good.\" And I didn't know this. You can just ask. And especially now it's kind of recession, you can ask companies like, \"I need a discount.\" You don't need to be asshole, about it. Say, \"I need a discount or I need to go maybe to another company. Maybe a discount here and there?\" And they say, \"Sure.\" A lot of them will say yes, 25% discount, 50% discount. Because you think the price on the website is the price of the API or something. It's not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also you're a public facing person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That helps also.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's love and good vibes that you put out into the world. You're actually legitimately trying to build cool stuff. So a lot of companies probably want to associate with you because you're trying to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's like a secret hack. But I think even without....<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Secret hack. Be a good person.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It depends how much discount they will give. They'll maybe give more, but that's why you should shit post on Twitter, so you get discounts maybe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah. And also when it's crowdsourced, paying does prevent spam or help prevent spam.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Also. Yeah. Yeah. It gives you high quality users.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>High quality users.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Free users are, sorry, but they're horrible. It's just millions of people especially with AI startups. You get a lot of abuse, so you get millions of people from anywhere just abusing your app, just hacking it and whatever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's something on the internet. You mentioned like 4Chan discovered Hood Maps.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but I love 4Chan. I don't love 4Chan, but you know what I mean. They're so crazy, especially back then. It's kind of funny what they do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Actually, what is it? This new documentary on Netflix, Anti-Social Network or something like that. That really was fascinating. Just 4Chan, just the spirit of the thing, 4Chan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People misunderstand 4Chan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so much about freedom and also the humor involved in fucking with the system and fucking the man.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's it. It's just anti-system.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But for fun. The dark aspect of it is you're having fun, you're doing anti-system stuff, but the Nazis always show up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That shift started happening.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's drifting somehow. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Like school shootings and stuff. So it's a very difficult topic. But I do know, especially early on, I think 2010, I would go to 4Chan for fun and they would post crazy offensive stuff. And this was just to scare off people. So we'd show to other people, say, \"Hey, do you know this internet website 4Chan? Just check it out.\" And they'd be, \"Dude, what the fuck is that?\" I'm like, \"No, no, you don't understand. That's to scare you away. But actually when you go through scroll, there's deep conversations.\" And they would already be... This was like a normie filter to stop. So kind of cool. But yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It goes dark.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're like stop. So, cool, but yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It goes dark.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It goes dark, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if you have those people show up, they'll for the fun of it, do a bunch of racist things and all that kind of stuff you were saying.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think it was never... Man, I'm not a fortune, but it was always about provoking. It's just provocateurs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the provoking in the case of hood maps or something like this can damage a good thing. A little poison in a town is always good. It's like the Tom Waits thing, but you don't want too much, otherwise it destroys the town. It destroys the thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But they're like pen testers, penetration testers, hackers. They just test your app for you and then you add some stuff. I had a NSFW word list. They would say bad words, so when they would write bad words, they would get forwarded to YouTube, which was a video. It was a very relaxing video that ASMR with glowing jelly, streaming like this to relax them or cheese melting on the toast to chill them out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I like it. But actually, a lot of stuff, I didn't realize how much originated in Forchand in terms of memes. Rick Roll, I didn't understand... I didn't know that Rick Roll originated in Forchand. There's so many memes, most of the memes that you think it takes-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The word roll I think comes from Forchand, not the word roll, but in this case, in the meme use, you would get roll doubles because every... It was post IDs on Forchand. So, they were random. So, if I get doubles, this happens or something. So, you'd get two-two... Anyway, it's like a betting market on these doubles on these post IDs. There's so much funny stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. That's the internet that's purist. But yeah, again, the dark stuff seeps in and it's nice to keep the dark stuff to some low amount. It's nice to have a bit of noise in the darkness, but not too much.

This guy is biased or something. I have GPT-4o and it's really, really, really, really good. It understands humor.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I thought this week, I tweeted a fact check. You can click fact check and then GPT-4o... Look, GPT-4o is not always right about stuff, but it can give you a general fact check on a tweet. Usually, what I do now when I write something difficult about economics or something about AI, I put in GPT-4o, I say, \"Can you fact check it?\" Because I might've said something stupid. And the stupid stuff always gets taken out by the replies like, \"Oh, you said this wrong.\" And then, the whole tweet doesn't make sense anymore. So, I ask GPT-4o to fact check a lot of stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, fact check is a tough one, but it would be interesting to rate a thing based on how well thought out it is and how well argued it is.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. And you can ask that. You can ask in the prompt, I don't know, for example, do you think... Create a ranking score of X Twitter replies where should this post be if we rank on, I don't know, integrity, reality, fundamental deepness or something, interestness, and it would give you that a pretty good score probably. Elon can do this with Grok. He can start using that to check replies because their reply section is chaos.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And you get too many replies now. If you have a lot of followers, I get too many replies, I don't see everything, and a lot of stuff I just miss and I want to see the good stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also the notifications or whatever, it's just complete chaos. It'd be nice to be able to filter that in interesting ways, sort it in interesting ways. Because I feel like I miss a lot.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If it's a very good comment, it should happen, but it should probably look a little bit more like, do these people have followers because they're probably more engaged in a platform, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh no, I don't even care about how many followers. If you're ranking by the quality of the comment, great, but not just randomly chronological just a sea of comments.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>X could be very proof of that, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One thing you espouse a lot, which I love is the automation step. So, once you have a thing, once you have an idea, and you build it, and it actually starts making money, and it's making people happy, there's a community of people using it. You want to take the automation step of automating the things you have to do as little work as possible for it to keep running indefinitely. Can you explain your philosophy there? What you mean by automate?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, the general theory of starters would be that when it starts, you start making money, you start hiring people to do stuff, do stuff that you like marketing, for example, do stuff that you would do in the beginning yourself. And whatever, community management, and organizing meetups for Nomad List, for example, that would be a job, for example. And I felt like I don't have the money for that and I don't really want to run a big company with a lot of people because there's a lot of work managing these people. So, I've always tried to automate these things as much as possible. And this can literally be like for Nomad List, it's not a different other starters, it's like a webpage where you can organize your own meetup, set a schedule, a date, whatever. You could see how many Nomads will be there at that date. So, there will be actually enough Nomads to meet up. And then, when it's done, it sends a tweet out on the Nomad List account, there's a meetup here, it sends a direct message to everybody in the city who are there, who are going to be there. And then, people show up on a bar, and there's a meetup, and that's fully automated. And for me, it's so obvious to make this automatic, why would you have somebody organize this? It makes more sense to automate it, and this with most of my things, I figure out how to do it with codes and I think especially now with AI, you can automate so much more stuff than before because AI understands things so well. Before I would use if statements. Now, you ask GPT, you put something in GPT-4o in the API and it sends back, this is good, this is bad.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, you basically can now even automate subjective type of things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is the difference now and that's very recent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's still difficult to... That step of automation is difficult to figure out how to, because you're basically delegating everything to code. It's not trivial to take that step for a lot of people. So, when you say automate, are you talking about cron jobs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Man, a lot of cron jobs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of cron jobs.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Literally, I log into the server and I do pseudo cron tab dash E, and then I go into edit and I write hourly. And then, I write PHP, do this thing dot PHP, and that's a script, and that script does a thing and it does it then hourly. That's it. And that's how all my websites work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you have a thing where it emails you, or something like this, or emails somebody managing the thing if something goes wrong?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I have these webpages I make, they're called health checks, so it's like healthcheck.php. And then, it has emojis, it has a green check mark if it's good, and a red one if it's bad, and then it does database queries. For example, what's the internet speed in, for example, Amsterdam? Okay, it's a number. It's 27 point megabits, so it's accurate number. Okay, check, good. And then, it goes to the next and it goes on all the data points. Did people sign up in the last 24 hours? It's important because maybe the sign-up broke. Okay, check, somebody sign up. Then I have uptimerobot.com, which is for uptime, but it can also check keywords. It checks for an emoji, which is the red X, which is if something is bad. And so, it opens that health check page every minute to check if something is bad. Then if it's bad, it sends a message to me on Telegram saying, \"Hey, what's up?\" It doesn't say, \"Hey, what's up?\" It sends me alert.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Hey. Hey, sweetie.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This thing is down and then I check. So, within a minute of something breaking, I know it, and then I can open my laptop and fix it. But the good thing is the last few years, things don't break anymore. And definitely 10 years ago when I started, everything was breaking all the time. And now it's almost last week it was like 100.000% uptime and these health checks are part of the uptime percentage. So, it's like everything works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're actually making me realize I should have a page for myself, one page that has all the health checks just so I can go to it and see all the green check marks.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right. We're okay, everything's okay.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For sure. It used to send me the good health checks. It all works. It all works. It all works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's been so often.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I'm like, this feels so good. But then I'm like, okay, obviously it's not going to... You need to hide the good ones and show only the bad ones and now that's the case.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I need integrate everything into one place. Automate everything. They have also just a large set of cron jobs. A lot of the publication of this podcast is done all... Everything is just on automatically, it's all clipped up, all those kind of stuff. But it would be nice to automate even more. Translation, all those kind of stuff would be nice to automate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Every JavaScript, every PHP error gets sent to my telegram as well. So, every user, whatever user it is, doesn't have to be page user. If they run into an error, the JavaScript sends the JavaScript error to the server and then it sends to my Telegram from all my websites.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you get a message.<|eot_id|>"}

It should be doing that for you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's some level of automation. That would be interesting.

There's limitations that don't make it easy to do automate because the thing that they're trying to limit abuse or for you to steal all the data from the app to then train in LLM or something like this. But if I just want to figure out ways to automate my interaction with X system or with Instagram, they don't make that easy.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's sad. So, I've been in a lot of acquisition like deals and stuff, and I learn a lot about finance people as well there, manipulation, and due diligence, and then changing the valuation. People change the valuation after. So, a lot of people string you on to acquire you and then it takes six months. It's a classic. It takes six to 12 months. They want to see everything. They want to see your stripe, and your code, and whatever. And then, in the end, they'll change the price to lower because you're already so invested. So, it's like a negotiation tactic. I'm like, \"No, I don't want to sell.\" And the problem with my companies is they make 90% profit margin. Companies get sold with multiples, multiples of profit or revenue. And often the multiple is three times, three times or four times or five times revenue or profit. So, in my case, they're all automated, so I might as well wait three years and I get the same money as when I sell and then I can still sell the same company. You know what I mean? I can still sell it for three to five times. So, financially, it doesn't really make sense to sell unless the price is high enough. If the price gets to six or seven or eight, I don't want to wait six years for the money, but if you give me three years, nothing, I can wait.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, that means there are really valuable stuff about the companies you create is not just the interface and the crowdsource content, but the people themselves, the user base.<|eot_id|>"}

It's something would be nice when you are old because you're still working in this. It has a mission, which is like people should travel anywhere, and they can work from anywhere, and they can meet different cultures. And that's a good way to make the world get better. If you go to China and live in China, you'll learn that they're nice people. And a lot of stuff you hear about China's propaganda, a lot of stuff is true as well, but it's more you learn a lot from traveling. And I think that's why it's a cool product to not sell. AI products, I have less emotional feeling with AI products like Photo AI, which I could sell. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The thing you also mentioned is you have to price in the fact that you're going to miss the company you created.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the meaning it gives you. This is very famous like depression after startup finance sold their company. They're like, this was me. Who am I? And they immediately start building another one. They never can stop. So, I think it's good to keep working until you die. Just keep working on cool stuff and you shouldn't retire.

You get an average idea, average company, average culture, you need to have a leader or you need to be solo and just do it. Do it yourself, I think.

I think I'm very skeptical of tools when people think they say it matters, right? I don't think it matters. I think whatever tool you know very well, you can go very fast. And the shortcuts, for example, IDE. I love Sublime text because I could use multi-cursor. You search something and then I could make mass replaces in a file with the cursor thing and the VS Code doesn't really have that as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sublime is the first editor where I've learned that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, VS Code's not so good at it, I think, or at least I tried it. But I would use that to process data, like data sets.

Man, I was bullied into using VS Code because Twitter would always see my screenshots of Sublime text and say, \"Why are you still using Sublime text, Boomer. You need to use VS Code.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, I'll try it.\" I got a new MacBook and then I never install. I never copy the old MacBook. I just make it fresh, like a clean format C Windows, clean starts. And I'm like, \"Okay, I'll try VS Code.\" And it's stuck, but I don't really care.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Dude, it was so good. You would install windows and then after three or six months, it would start breaking and everything gets slow. Then you would restart, go to DOS, format C, you would delete your hard drive and then install the Windows 95 again. It was so good times. And you would design everything. Now, I'm going to install it properly. Now, I'm going to design my desktop properly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I don't know if it's peer pressure, but I used Emacs for many, many years and I love Lisp, so a lot of the customization is done in Lisp. It's a programming language. Partially, it was peer pressure, but part of it is realizing you need to keep learning stuff. The same issue with jQuery. I still think I need to learn NodeJS for example, even though that's not my main thing or even close to the main thing. But I feel like you need to keep learning this stuff. And even if you don't choose to use it long term, you need to give it a chance. So, your understanding of the world expands.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you want to understand the new technological concepts and see if they can benefit you. It would be stupid not to even try it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's more about the concepts I would say, than the actual tools expanding. And that can be a challenging thing. So, going to VS Code and really learning it, all the shortcuts, all the extensions, and actually installing different stuff and playing with it, that was an interesting challenge. It was uncomfortable at first.<|eot_id|>"}

The stuff I do in jQuery is essentially a lot of it is like I start rebuilding whatever tech is already out there, not based on that, but just on accident. I keep going long enough that I built the same. I start getting the same problems everybody else has and you start building the same frameworks kind. So, essentially I use my own framework of-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you basically build a framework from scratch that's your own, that you understand it.<|eot_id|>"}

And I think saying you don't have the time is always a lie because you just don't prioritize it enough. My priority is still running the businesses and improving that and AI. I think learning AI is much more valuable now than learning front end framework. It's just more impact.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess you should be just learning every single day a thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you can learn a little bit every day, a little bit of React or I think now Next is very big, so learn a little bit of Next.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, but you got to learn it in the same exact way as we were talking about, which is learn it by trying to build something with it and actually deploy it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The frameworks are so complicated and it changes so fast. So, it's like where do I start? And I guess it's the same thing when you're starting out making websites, where do you start as GPT-4, I guess. But yeah, it's just so dynamic. It changes so fast that I don't know if it would be a good idea for me to learn it. Maybe some combination of few Next with PHP Laravel. Laravel is like a framework for PHP. I think that it could benefit me. Maybe Tailwind for CSS, like a styling engine. That stuff could probably save me time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But yeah, you won't know until you really give it a try. And it feels like you have to build, if maybe I'm talking to myself, but I should probably recode my personal one page in Laravel. Or even though it might not have almost any dynamic elements, maybe have one dynamic element, but it has to go end to end in that framework or end-to-end build in NodeJS. Some of it is figuring out how to you even deploy the thing.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because they usually know the dominant. They give answers that are the most probable kind of, so that makes sense to ask them.

What happens is it depends, if they're a world-class developer, yes. Oftentimes, they themselves are used to that thing and they have not themselves explored in other options. So, they have this dogmatic talking down to you, \"This is the right way to do it.\" It's like, \"No, no, no, we're just exploring together. Okay, show me the cool thing you've tried,\" which is it has to have open mindedness to NodeJS is not the right way to do web development. It's like one way. And there's nothing wrong with the old LAMP, PHP, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript way. It just has its pros and cons and you need to know what the pros and cons are.<|eot_id|>"}

I think there's a science to it, but I don't really care. You just have to be a scientist of one, study yourself, your own brain. For me, it does something. I discovered it right away when I tried it for the first time. After about a couple of minutes, everything, every distraction just disappears. And it goes like, shh. You can hold focus on things really well. It's weird. You can really focus on a thing. It doesn't really matter what that is. I think that's what people achieve with meditation.

I say it's cool to play those little tricks with your mind to study yourself.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, in the coworking space, we would do a money pot, like a mug.

And then 15 minutes free time, we can party whatever. And then 45 minutes again working and that worked. But you need to shut people up or they...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think there's an intimacy in being silent together that maybe I'm uncomfortable with, but you need to make yourself vulnerable and actually do it with close friends to just sit there in silence for long periods of time and doing a thing.<|eot_id|>"}

I think he has a lot of practice in that. I do that as well. And in team setting, when you're thinking, brainstorming and you allow yourself to just think in silence. Because even in meetings, people want to talk. It's like no, you think before you speak. And it's okay to be silent together.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not personalized, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then you have to become a student of your own body, of your own self, of how you work.

For me, fasting was an interesting one because I used to eat a bunch of meals a day, especially when I was lifting heavy, because everybody says that you have to eat a lot, multiple meals a day, but I realized I can get much stronger, feel much better if I eat once or twice a day.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a job board for remote jobs. Because back then, 10 years ago, there was job boards, but it was not really specifically remote job, job boards. So I made one. First on NomadList, I made Nomad Jobs, like a page. And a lot of companies started hiring and it paid for job posts. So I spin it off to Remote OK, and now it's the number one or number two biggest remote job boards. And it's also fully automated. People just post a job and people apply. It has profiles as well. It's like LinkedIn for remote work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just focus on remote only?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It's essentially like a simple job board. I discovered job boards are way more complicated than you think, but yeah, it's a job board for remote jobs. But the nice thing is you can charge a lot of money for job posts. Man, it's good money, B2B. You start with 2.99, but at the peak, when the feds started printing money like 2021, I was making 140K a month with Remote OK with just job posts. And I started adding crazy upsells, like rainbow-colored job posts. You can add your background image. It's just upsells, man. And you charge a thousand dollars for an upsell. It was crazy. All these companies just upsell, upsell. Yeah, we want everything. Job posts would cost $3,000, $4,000. And I was like, \"This is good business.\" And then the feds stopped printing money and it all went down, and it went down to like 10K a month from 140. Now it's back, I think it's 40. It was good times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got to ask you about, back to the digital nomad life, you wrote a blog post on the reset and in general, just giving away everything, living a minimalist life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What did it take to do that, to get rid of everything?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>10 years ago was this trend in the blog.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, it's ridiculous, but you write down every object you have in your house and you count it. You make a spreadsheet and you're like, \"Okay, I have 500 things.\" You need to get it down to 100. Why? It was just the trend. So I did it. I started selling stuff, started throwing away stuff. And I did MDMA and ecstasy 2012. And after that trip, I felt so different and I felt like I had to start throwing shit away. I swear.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I started throwing shit away and I felt that it was almost like the drug sending me to a path of, you need to throw all your shit away.

Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it to get down to 100 items?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, you need to sell your PC and stuff. You need to go on eBay, and then... Man, going eBay selling all your stuff is very interesting because you discover society. You meet the craziest people. You meet every range from rich to poor, everybody comes to your house to buy stuff. It's so funny. It's so interesting. I recommend everybody do this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to meet people that want your shit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I didn't know. I was living in Amsterdam and I didn't know I have my own subculture or whatever, and I discovered the Dutch people as they are from eBay. So I sold everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the weirdest thing you had to sell and you had to find a buyer for? Not the weirdest, but what's memorable?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So back then, I was making music and we would make music videos with a Canon 5D camera. Back then, everybody's making films and music videos of that. And we bought it with my friends and stuff, and it was kind of like I had to sell this thing too, because it was very expensive, like 6K or something. But it meant that selling this, meant that we wouldn't make music videos anymore. I would leave Holland. This stuff we were working on would end. And I was saying, \"This music video stuff, we're not getting big, we're not getting famous in this or successful. We need to stop doing this.\" This music production also, it's not really working. And I felt very bad for my friends because we would work together on this and to sell this camera that we'd make stuff with and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It was a hard goodbye.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think that's what I learned from it. You learn that you can live with very little objects, very little stuff, but there's a counter to it. You lean more on the stuff, on the services. Right? For example, you don't need a car, you use Uber, right? Or you don't need kitchen stuff because you go to restaurants when you're traveling. So you lean more on other people's services, but you spend money on that as well. So that's good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but just letting go of material possessions, which gives a kind of freedom to how you move about the world. It gives you complete freedom to go into another city, to...<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Man, I recommend if you're 18, you get out of high school, do this, go travel and build some internet stuff, whatever. Bring your laptop and it's an amazing experience. Five years ago, I'd still go to university, but now I'm thinking like, \"No, maybe skip university.\" Just go first, travel around a little bit, figure some stuff out. You can go back to university when you're 25. You can like, \"Okay, now I learned to be successful in business.\" You have money. At least now, you can choose what you really want to study. Because people at 18, they go study what's probably good for the job market. Right? So it probably makes more sense. If you want that, go travel, build some businesses and go back to university if you want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the biggest uses of a university is the networking.

It's just I cannot recommend it enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well see, the thing is that when you're 18, I feel like depending on your personality, you have to learn both how to be a weirdo and how to be normie. You still have to learn how to fit into society. For a person like me, for example, who's always an outcast, there's always a danger for going full outcast. And that's a harder life.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Man, I feel also that you start as an outcast, but the more you work on yourself, the less shit you have.

Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's nice. As I mentioned to you, there's the show alone.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I have this problem that I try, I want to try help people and also like, \"Oh, let's make startups,\" and whatever. And I've learned over the years that generally for me... And it sounds maybe bad, but I helped my friend Andre, for example. He came up to me in the coworking space. That's how I met him. And he said, \"I want to learn to code. I want to do startups. How do we do it?\" I said, \"Okay, let's go, install Nginx. Let's start coding.\" And he has this self energy that he actually, he doesn't need to be pushed, he just goes and he just goes, and he asks questions and he doesn't ask too many questions. He just goes, goes and learns it. And now, he has a company and makes a lot of money, has his own startups. And the people that ask me for help, but then I gave help, and then they started debating it. Do you have that? People ask you for advice and they go against you to say, \"No, you're wrong because...\" I'm like, \"Okay, bro, I don't want to debate. You asked me for advice, right?\" And the people who need to push generally, it doesn't happen. You need to have this energy for yourself.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, they're searching. They're searching. They're trying to figure it out. But oftentimes, their search, if they successfully find what they're looking for, it'll be within. Sounds very like spiritual sounding, but it's really figuring that shit out on your own. But they're reaching, they're trying to ask the world around them like, \"How do I live this life? How do I figure this out?\" But ultimately, the answer is going to be from them working on themselves. And literally, it's the stupid thing, but Googling and doing like searching-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You need a space to congregate, man. And I found history on this. So 400 years ago in the coffee houses of Europe, the scientific revolution, the enlightenment happened. Because they would go to coffee houses, they would sit there, they would drink coffee and they would work. They would work, they would write, and they would do debates, and they would organize marine routes. Right? They would do all the stuff in coffee houses in Europe, in France, in Austria, in UK, in Holland. So we were always going to cafes to work and to have serendipitous conversations with other people and start businesses and stuff. And when you asked me to come on here and we flew to America, and the first thing I realized was that I've been to America before, but we were in this cafe and there's a lot of laptops. Everybody's working on something and I took this photo. And then when you're in Europe, large parts of Europe now, you cannot use a laptop anymore. No laptop, which I understand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that is to you, a fundamental place to create shit, is in that natural, organic co-working space of a coffee shop.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, for a lot of people. A lot of people have very small homes and co-working spaces are boring. They're private, they're not serendipitous, they're boring. Cafes are amazing because random people can come in and ask you, \"What are you working on?\" And not just laptops. People are also having conversations like they did 400 years ago, debates or whatever. Things are happening. And man, I understand the aesthetics of it. It's like, \"Start up bro. Shipping is a bullshit startup.\" But there's something more there. There's people actually making stuff, making new companies that the society benefits from. We're benefiting from Nvidia, I think. The US GDP for sure is benefiting from Nvidia. European GDP could benefit if we build more companies. And I feel in Europe, there's this vibe and this... You have to connect things, but not allowing laptops in cafes is part of the vibe. It's like, \"Yeah, we're not really here to work. We're here to enjoy life.\" I agree with this. Anthony Bourdain, this tweet was quoted with Anthony Bourdain photo of him with cigarettes and a coffee in France, and he said, \"This is what cafes are for.\" I agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there is some element of entrepreneurship. You have to allow people to dream big and work their ass off towards that dream, and then feel each other's energy as they interact with. That's one of the things I liked in Silicon Valley when I was working there, is the cafes. There's a bunch of dreamers that you can make fun of them for like, everybody thinks they're going to build a trillion-dollar company, but-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the story behind, for sure. So this is about the European economy, where...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>European economy landscape is ran by dinosaurs. And today, I studied it so I can produce you with my evidence. 80% of top EU companies were founded before 1950. Only 36% of top US companies were founded before 1950.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So the median founding of companies in US is something like 1960, and the median... The top companies, right? And the median in Europe is 1900 or something. So it's here, 1913 and 1963. So there's a 50-year difference.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a good representation of the very thing you were talking about, the difference in the cultures, entrepreneurial spirit of the peoples.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But Europe used to be entrepreneurial. There was companies founded in 1800, 1850, 1900. It flipped around 1950 where America took the lead. And I guess my point is, I hope that Europe gets back to... Because I'm European, I hope that Europe gets back to being an entrepreneurial culture where they build big companies again. Because right now, all the old dinosaur companies control the economies. They're lobbying with the government. Europe is also, they're infiltrated with the government where they create so much regulation. I think it's called regulatory capture, where it's very hard for a newcomer to enter an industry because there's too much regulation. So actually, regulation is very good for big companies because they can follow it. I can't follow it, right? If I want to start an AI startup in Europe now, I cannot because there's an AI regulation that makes it very complicated for me. I probably need to get notaries involved. I need to get certificates, licenses. Whereas in America, I can just open my laptop. I can start an AI startup right now mostly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about EAC, Effective Accelerationist movement?<|eot_id|>"}

EAC is a positive outlook on the future. Technology can make us... We spend more energy. We should find ways to of course, get clean energy, but we need to spend more energy to make cooler stuff and go into space and build more technology that can improve society.

You can steer the ship. It probably doesn't work out immediately. You probably go into very bad times like I did as well, relatively, right? But in the end, if you're smart about it, you can make things work and you can create your own little life of things as you did, as I did. And I think that should be more promoted. Do your own thing. There's space in economy and in society for, do your own thing. It's like little villages, everybody would sell. I would sell bread. You would sell meat. Everybody can do their own little thing.
