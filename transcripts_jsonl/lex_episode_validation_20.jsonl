He is a self-taught developer and entrepreneur who designed, programed shipped and ran over 40 startups, many of which are hugely successful. In most cases, he did it all by himself while living the digital nomad life in over 40 countries and over 150 cities, programming on a laptop while chilling on a couch, using vanilla HTML, jQuery, PHP and SQLight. He builds and ships quickly, and improves on the fly, all in the open, documenting his work, both his successes and failures, with a raw honesty of a true indie hacker. Pieter is an inspiration to a huge number of developers and entrepreneurs who love creating cool things in the world that are hopefully useful for people. This was an honor and a pleasure for me. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Pieter Levels.

So, anyway, so Nomad List is great. I would love for you to talk about that. But one sort of way to talk about it is through you building hood maps.

They don't know much about web development. They don't know much about programming, so they just don't give any respect.

And there's a team and not many people are using it, but every single feature, they have to meet and agree. And there's allocate resources. Engineers have to work on it.

But if you don't have enough dictatorial top down, when- ... have enough dictatorial top-down like we need this now.

I discovered it right away when I tried it for the first time. After about a couple of minutes, everything, every distraction just disappears. And it goes like, shh.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This was for Twitter to mute, to share the mute list.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Fire calculator, no more Google, maker rank, how much is my side project worth, climate finder, ideasai, airlinelist-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>safety of airlines. Because I was nervous to fly, so I was like, \"Let's collect all the data on the crashes for all the airplanes.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Bali sea cable. Nice. That's awesome. Make village, nomad gear, 3D and virtual reality dev, play my inbox, like you mentioned. There's a lot of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm trying to find some embarrassing tweets of yours.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can go to the highlights tab. It has all the good shit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There you go.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This was Dubai.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>POV, building an AI startup. Wow. You're a real influencer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And if people copy this photo now and they change the screenshots, it becomes like a meme, of course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's how Dubai looks. It's insane.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's beautiful architecture. It's crazy, the story behind the cities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the story behind, for sure. So this is about the European economy, where...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>European economy landscape is ran by dinosaurs. And today, I studied it so I can produce you with my evidence. 80% of top EU companies were founded before 1950. Only 36% of top US companies were founded before 1950.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>median... The top companies, right? And the median in Europe is 1900 or something. So it's here, 1913 and 1963. So there's a 50-year difference.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a good representation of the very thing you were talking about, the difference in the cultures, entrepreneurial spirit of the peoples.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>involved. I need to get certificates, licenses. Whereas in America, I can just open my laptop. I can start an AI startup right now mostly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about EAC, Effective Accelerationist movement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>into space and build more technology that can improve society. And we shouldn't shy away from technology. Technology can be the answer for many things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, build more. Don't spend so much time on fear-mongering and cautiousness and all this kind of stuff. Some was okay, some was good, but most of the time should be spent on building and creating and doing so unapologetically. It's a refreshing reminder of what made United States great, is all the builders. Like you said, the entrepreneurs. We can't forget that in all the discussions of how things could go wrong with technology and all this kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this way. You're from here, you go like this, and then you can go this or this. I think you should go this way and...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Go up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, go up. And I think the problem is the mind culture. So EUAC, I made EUAC, which is the European version.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I get it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>great again hat. I made it red first, but it became too like Trump. So now, it's more like European blue, make Europe great again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right. Okay. So you had an incredible life. Very successful, built a lot of cool stuff. So what advice would you give to young people about how to do the same?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can do their own little thing. You don't need to be a normie, as you say. You can be what you really want to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And go all out doing that thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>need to go lean into the outcast stuff. Lean into the being different and just doing whatever it is that you want to do. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got a whole ass it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Whole ass it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This was an incredible conversation. It was an honor to finally meet you.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was an honor to be here, Lex.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To talk to you and keep doing your thing. Keep inspiring me and the world with all the cool stuff you're building.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you, Man.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Pieter Levels. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Drew Houston, Dropbox co-founder. By the way, I love Dropbox. Anyway, Drew said, \"Don't worry about failure. You only have to be right once.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
