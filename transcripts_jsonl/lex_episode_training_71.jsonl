{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We should never, and I never sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to destroy us. They won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, prime Minister of Israel, currently serving his sixth term in office. He's one of the most influential, powerful, and controversial men in the world, leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history. As we spoke, and as I speak now, large scale protests are breaking out all over Israel over this government's proposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power. Given the current intense political battles in Israel, our previous intention to speak for three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future. I will also interview people who harshly disagree with words spoken in this conversation. I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with historians and activists, and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war, destruction and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this, I will travel anywhere no matter how dangerous if there's any chance, it may help add to understanding and love in the world. I believe in the power of conversation to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm under-qualified and under-skilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short and I will certainly get attacked, derided and slandered. But I will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn to improve, and no matter what, never give into cynicism. This life, this world of ours is too beautiful not to keep trying. Trying to do some good in whatever way each of us know how. I love you all. This is The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Benjamin Netanyahu. You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many. In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man or a young woman listening to this right now who have such hate in their heart, what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what we have to say. What I have to say as a leader of Israel whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world. So I disagree with that. And the most important thing that goes against what you said is the respect that we receive from the Arab world and the fact that we've made four historic peace agreements with Arab countries. And they made it with me, they didn't make it with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect me and probably more to come. So I think the premise is wrong, that's all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of love, yes. A lot of leaders are collaborating are -<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Respect, I said not love.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. All right. Well, it's a spectrum, but there is people who don't have good things to say about Israel, who do have hate in their heart for Israel.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And what can you say to those people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>world for the better and spreading this among six continents. We've sent rescue teams more than any other country in the world, and we're one 10th of 1% of the world's population. But when there's an earthquake or a devastation in Haiti or in the Philippines, Israel is there. When there's an devastating earthquake in Turkey, Israel was there. When there's something in Nepal, Israel is there, and it's the second country. It's the second country after, in one case, India or after another case, the United States, Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're a student of history. If I can just linger on that philosophical notion of hate, that part of human nature. If you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature, from the rise of the Third Reich and the rise of somebody like Hitler and the hate that permeates that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thing. And that happened in the case of the Jews. What started with the Jews soon spread to all of humanity. So what we've learned is that we should never, and I never sit aside and say, \"Oh, they're just threatening to destroy us. They won't do it.\" If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then, and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in those threats underlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism, and how much of it is anti-Semitism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>between the two. You can't say, \"Well, I'm, I'm okay with Jews, but I just don't think there should be a Jewish state.\" It's like saying, \"I'm not anti-American, I just don't think there should be an America.\" That's basically what people are saying vis-a-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. When you're saying anti-Zionism you're saying that Jewish people don't have a right to have a state of their own. And that is a denial of a basic principle that I think completely unmasks what is involved here. Today anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish people oppose the Jewish state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we jump from human history to the current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial reform that gives power to your government to override the Supreme Court. So the critics say that this gives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, that's ridiculous. The mere fact that you have so many demonstrations and protests, some dictatorship, huh? There's a lot of democracy here, more rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you still man the case that this may give too much power to the coalition government, to the prime minister, not just to you, but to those who follow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that just perpetrates itself. And we want to correct that. Again, we want to correct it in a balanced way. And that's basically what we're trying to do. So I think there's a lot of misinformation about that. We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was in its first 50 years. And it was a stellar democracy. It still is. Israel is a democracy, will remain a democracy, a vibrant democracy. And believe me, the fact that people are arguing and demonstrating in the streets and protesting is the best proof of that, and that's how it'll remain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We spoke about tech companies offline, there's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform. Can you speak to why large and small companies have a future in Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>find it everywhere. Everything is becoming technologized. And in Israel, everybody is dealing in everything, and that's a potent reservoir of talent that the world is not going to pass up. And in fact, it's coming to us. We just had Nvidia coming here, and they decided to build a supercomputer in Israel. Wonder why? We've had Intel coming here and deciding now to invest $25 billion, just now, in a new plant in Israel. I wonder why? I don't wonder why. They know why. Because the talent is here and the freedom is here. And it will remain so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You had a conversation about AI with Sam Altman of Open AI and with Elon Musk.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the content of that conversation? What's your vision for this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>world. The questions I don't have an answer to is, where does it go? How much does it chew up on jobs? There's an assumption that I'm not sure is true, that the two big previous revolutions in the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, definitely produced more jobs than they consumed. That is not obvious to me at all. I mean, I could see new jobs creating, and yes, I have that comforting statement, but it's not quite true, because I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs, many more jobs than they'll create.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At least in the short term. And we don't know about the long term.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what do they do? The first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite exchanges is, what do you do? Well, people define themselves by their profession. It's going to be difficult if you don't have a profession. People will spend more time self-searching, more time in the arts, more time in leisure. I understand that. If I have to bet, it will annihilate many more jobs than it will create and it'll force a structural change in our economics, in our economic models, and in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's going to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's something we have to respond to at the nation level and just as a human civilization, both the threat of AI to just us as a human species and then the effect on the jobs. And like you said, cybersecurity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What do you think? You think we're going to lose control?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, first of all, I do believe, maybe naively, that it will create more jobs than it takes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Write that down and we'll check it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's on record.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't say, \"We'll check it after our lifetime.\" No, we'll see it in a few years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We'll see it in a few years. I'm really concerned about cybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. In terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about, versus AI taking complete control and superseding the human species. Although that is something you should consider seriously because of the exponential growth of its capabilities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's exactly the exponential growth, which we understand is before us, but we don't really ... It's very hard to project forward.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To really understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we'll make Israel a formidable AI power. We understand the limitation of skill, computing power and other things. But I think within those limits, I think we can make here this miracle that we did in many other things. We do more with less. I don't care if it's the production of water or the production of energy or the production of knowledge or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other, we just do more with less. And I think in AI, we're going to do a lot more with a relatively small but highly gifted population. Very gifted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So taking a small tangent, as we talked about offline, you have a background in TaeKwonDo?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We mentioned Elon Musk. I've trained with both. Just as a quick question, who are you betting on in a fight?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Such a politician, you are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>when I came to ... It wasn't even at MIT. At MIT, I think I did karate. But when I came to the UN, I had a martial arts expert who taught me TaeKwonDo, which was interesting. Now, the question you really have to ask is, why did we learn martial arts in this special elite unit? And the answer is, there's no point. If you saw Indiana Jones, there's no point. You just pull the trigger. That's simple. Now, I don't expect anyone to pull the trigger on this combat, and I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

If you amass enormous amount of economic power, which is information power, that also monopolizes the political process. These are real questions that are not obvious.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you're saying basically the regulatory instrument is the market?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In large part, in most part, that's the hope. Maybe I'm a dreamer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what is good and what is bad. Let the masses decide. Let them vote every four years or whatever, and they throw you out. By the way, it happened to me. There's life after political death. There's actually political life. I was reelected five or six times, and this is my sixth term. So I believe in that. I'm not sure that in economic matters, in the geometric growth of tech companies, that you'll always have the little guy, the nimble mammal, that will come out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs, which is essentially what you said.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I wouldn't count out the little guy.<|eot_id|>"}

So you have served six terms as prime minister over 15 years in power. Let me ask you again, human nature. Do you worry about the corrupting nature of power on you as a leader, on you as a man?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>power in the press, no power in many quarters here and so on, nothing. I mean, probably, I'm going to be very soon the longest serving prime minister in the last half century in the Western democracies. But that's not because I amassed great political power in any of the institutions. I remember I had a conversation with Silvio Berlusconi, who recently died, and he said to me about, I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that, he said, \"So Bibi, how many of Israel's television stations do you have?\" And I said, \"None.\" He said, \"You have none?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they have constant press attacks, they've chosen to put me back in. So I don't believe in this thing of amassing the corrupting power of if you don't have elections. If you control the means of influencing the voters, I understand what you're saying, but in my case, it's exact opposite. I have to constantly go in elections, constantly with a disadvantage that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes against me, but it's fine. And I keep on winning. So I don't know what you're talking about. I would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere, not here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you have been involved in several corruption cases. How much corruption is there in Israel and how do you fight it in your own party and in Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and that's very good, just objective things are coming out and changing the picture. So I would say the attempt to brand me as corrupt is falling on its face. But the thing that is being uncovered in the trial, such as the use of spyware on a politician, a politician's surroundings to try to shake them down in investigations, put them in flea-ridden cells for 21 days. Invite their 84 year old mother to investigations without cause, bringing in their mistresses in the corridor, shaking them down, that's what people are asking. That corruption is what they want corrected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians? Let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dispute is something else. You have a territorial dispute if you say, \"Okay, you are living on this side, we're living on that side. Let's decide where the border is and so on.\" That's not what the argument is. The Palestinian society, which is itself fragmented, but all the factions agree, there shouldn't be a Jewish state anywhere. They just disagree between Hamas that says, \"Oh, well you should have it. We should get rid of it with terror.\" And the others who say, \"We know we should also use political means to dissolve it.\" So that is the problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So even as part of a two-state solution, they're still against the idea.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Arab subjects. So I think that principle is less than perfect sovereignty because you're taking a certain amount of sovereign powers, especially security away. But I think it's the only practical solution. So people say, \"Ah, but it's not a perfect state.\" I say, \"Okay, call it what you will. Call it, I don't know, limited sovereignty. Call it the autonomy plus. Call it whatever you want to call it.\" But that's the reality. And right now, if you ask Israelis across the political spectrum, except the very hard left, most Israelis agree with that. They don't really debate it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a two-state solution where Israel controls the security of the entire region.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't call it quite that. I mean there are different names, but the idea is yes, Israel controls security in the, is the entire area. It's this tiny area between the Jordan River and the sea. I mean it's like, you can walk it in not one afternoon. If you're really fit, you can do it in a day, less than a day. I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the expansion of settlements in the West Bank has been a top priority for this new government. So people may harshly criticize this as contributing to escalating the Israel-Palestine tensions. Can you understand that perspective, that this expansion of settlements is not good for this two-state solution?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't think that we should accept the premise that we have to wait for the Palestinians because we'll have to wait forever.\" So I decided to do it differently. I decided to go directly to the Arab capitals and to make the historic Abraham Accords and essentially reversing the equation, not a peace process that goes inside out, but outside in. And we went directly to these countries and forged these breakthrough peace accords with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain, with Morocco and with Sudan. And we're now trying to expand that in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does it take to do that with Saudi Arabia, with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to the other places. There's no way to avoid this, you have to go through this impassable pass. And I think that now people are recognizing that we'll go around it and probably circle back. And that, I think, actually gives hope not only to have an Arab-Israeli peace, but circling back in Israeli-Palestinian peace. And obviously this is not something that you find in the soundbites and so on, but in the popular discussion of the press. But that idea is permeating and I think it's the right idea, because I think it's the only one that will work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So expanding the circle of peace, just to linger on that requires what? Secretly talking man-to-man, human-to-human, to leaders of other nations and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Theoretically, you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Theoretically. Okay. Well, let me ask you another theoretical question on this circle of peace. As a student of history, looking at the ideas of war and peace, what do you think can achieve peace in the war in Ukraine looking at another part of the world? If you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world, how can you apply that to that other part of the world between Russia and Ukraine now?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of dominating first the Muslim world, and then eliminating Israel, and then becoming a global force, having nuclear weapons. It's totally different when they don't have it than when they do have it. And that's why one of my main goals has been to prevent Iran from having the means of mass destruction, which will be used, atomic bombs, which they openly say will be used against us. And you can understand that. How to bring about an end to Ukraine? I have my ideas. I don't think that's worthwhile discussing them now because they might be required later on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you believe in the power of conversation? Since you have contacts with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in a room and discussing how the end of war can be brought about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's a combination of that, but I think it's the question of interest and whether you have to get both sides to a point where they think that that conversation would lead to something useful. I don't think they're there right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What part of this is just basic human ego, stubbornness all of this between leaders, which is why I bring up the power of conversation, of sitting in a room realizing we're human beings, and then there's a history that connects Ukraine and Russia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think they're in a position to enter a room right now, realistically. I mean, you can posit that it would be good if that could happen, but entering the room is sometimes more complicated than what happens in the room. And there's a lot of pre-negotiations on the negotiation, then you negotiate endlessly on the negotiation. They're not even there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It took a lot of work for you to get to a handshake in the past.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a great thing. So I'm looking at this larger thing. You can be hobbled by saying, \"Oh, well, you've had this hiccup in Gaza or this or that thing happening in the Palestinians.\" It's important for us because we want security. But I think the larger question is can we break out into a much wider peace and ultimately come back and make the peace between Israel and the Palestinians rather than waiting to solve that and never getting to paint on the larger canvas? I want to paint on the larger canvas and come back to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As you write about in your book, what have you learned about life from your father?<|eot_id|>"}

I disagree with that. I think you have to constantly increase your understanding of things as they change, because my father was right. You need to broaden and deepen your education as you go along. You can't just sit back and say, \"Well, I studied some things in university, or in college, or in Boston, or at MIT, and that's enough. I've done it.\" No, learn, learn, learn, learn. Never stop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if I may suggest as part of the education, I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky, in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read.<|eot_id|>"}

History, history and history.\" That's the fundamental discipline for political life. But then you have to study other things, study economics, study politics and so on, and study the military if you have... I had an advantage because I spent some years there, so I learned a lot of that, but I had to acquire the other disciplines. And you never acquire enough. So read, read, read. And by the way, if I have to choose, I read history, history and history. Good works of history, not lousy books.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Last question.

And that is to assure the future and security, and I would say permanence, but that is obviously a limited thing, of the Jewish state and the Jewish people. I don't think one can exist without the other. So I've devoted my life to that.

We need a coalition of the like-minded smarts. This is a smart nation. And we share the basic values of freedom and liberty with the United States.
