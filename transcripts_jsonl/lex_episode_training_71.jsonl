Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, prime Minister of Israel, currently serving his sixth term in office. He's one of the most influential, powerful, and controversial men in the world, leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most intense and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history. As we spoke, and as I speak now, large scale protests are breaking out all over Israel over this government's proposed judicial reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power. Given the current intense political battles in Israel, our previous intention to speak for three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again for much longer in the future. I will also interview people who harshly disagree with words spoken in this conversation. I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with historians and activists, and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war, destruction and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this, I will travel anywhere no matter how dangerous if there's any chance, it may help add to understanding and love in the world. I believe in the power of conversation to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm under-qualified and under-skilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short and I will certainly get attacked, derided and slandered. But I will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn to improve, and no matter what, never give into cynicism. This life, this world of ours is too beautiful not to keep trying. Trying to do some good in whatever way each of us know how. I love you all. This is The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Benjamin Netanyahu. You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many. In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man or a young woman listening to this right now who have such hate in their heart, what can you say to them to one day turn that hate into love?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect me and probably more to come. So I think the premise is wrong, that's all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a lot of love, yes. A lot of leaders are collaborating are -<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Respect, I said not love.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. All right. Well, it's a spectrum, but there is people who don't have good things to say about Israel, who do have hate in their heart for Israel.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And what can you say to those people?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>country after, in one case, India or after another case, the United States, Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're a student of history. If I can just linger on that philosophical notion of hate, that part of human nature. If you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature, from the rise of the Third Reich and the rise of somebody like Hitler and the hate that permeates that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too late.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in those threats underlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism, and how much of it is anti-Semitism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>basic principle that I think completely unmasks what is involved here. Today anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish people oppose the Jewish state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we jump from human history to the current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial reform that gives power to your government to override the Supreme Court. So the critics say that this gives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so many demonstrations and protests, some dictatorship, huh? There's a lot of democracy here, more rambunctious and more robust than just anywhere on the planet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you still man the case that this may give too much power to the coalition government, to the prime minister, not just to you, but to those who follow?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>me, the fact that people are arguing and demonstrating in the streets and protesting is the best proof of that, and that's how it'll remain.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We spoke about tech companies offline, there's a lot of tech companies nervous about this judicial reform. Can you speak to why large and small companies have a future in Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I wonder why? I don't wonder why. They know why. Because the talent is here and the freedom is here. And it will remain so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You had a conversation about AI with Sam Altman of Open AI and with Elon Musk.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was the content of that conversation? What's your vision for this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have that comforting statement, but it's not quite true, because I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs, many more jobs than they'll create.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At least in the short term. And we don't know about the long term.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it'll force a structural change in our economics, in our economic models, and in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's going to go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's something we have to respond to at the nation level and just as a human civilization, both the threat of AI to just us as a human species and then the effect on the jobs. And like you said, cybersecurity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What do you think? You think we're going to lose control?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, first of all, I do believe, maybe naively, that it will create more jobs than it takes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Write that down and we'll check it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's on record.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We don't say, \"We'll check it after our lifetime.\" No, we'll see it in a few years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We'll see it in a few years. I'm really concerned about cybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. In terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along the way that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about, versus AI taking complete control and superseding the human species. Although that is something you should consider seriously because of the exponential growth of its capabilities.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's exactly the exponential growth, which we understand is before us, but we don't really ... It's very hard to project forward.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To really understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more with less. And I think in AI, we're going to do a lot more with a relatively small but highly gifted population. Very gifted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So taking a small tangent, as we talked about offline, you have a background in TaeKwonDo?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We mentioned Elon Musk. I've trained with both. Just as a quick question, who are you betting on in a fight?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Such a politician, you are.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the trigger. That's simple. Now, I don't expect anyone to pull the trigger on this combat, and I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, martial arts is bigger than just combat. It's this journey of humility.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's an art form. It truly is an art. But it's fascinating that these two figures in tech are facing each other. I won't ask the question of who you would face and how you would do, but ...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I'm facing opponents all the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All the time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's part of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not yet.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm not sure about that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you announcing any fights?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as a 19th century Democrat, these are questions of the 21st century, which people should begin to think. Do you have a solution to that?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The solution of monopolies growing arbitrarily-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... unstoppably in power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In economic power, and therefore in political power.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, some of that is regulation, some of that is competition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you know where to draw the line? It's not breaking up AT&T. It's not that simple.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I believe in the power of competition, that there will always be somebody that challenges the big guys, especially in the space of AI. The more open source movements are taking hold, the more the little guy can become the big guy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So you're saying basically the regulatory instrument is the market?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In large part, in most part, that's the hope. Maybe I'm a dreamer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have the little guy, the nimble mammal, that will come out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs, which is essentially what you said.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I wouldn't count out the little guy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You wouldn't count out the little?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I hope you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let me ask you about this market of politics. So you have served six terms as prime minister over 15 years in power. Let me ask you again, human nature. Do you worry about the corrupting nature of power on you as a leader, on you as a man?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>something like that, he said, \"So Bibi, how many of Israel's television stations do you have?\" And I said, \"None.\" He said, \"You have none?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you have?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fine. And I keep on winning. So I don't know what you're talking about. I would say the concentration of power lies elsewhere, not here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you have been involved in several corruption cases. How much corruption is there in Israel and how do you fight it in your own party and in Israel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>investigations without cause, bringing in their mistresses in the corridor, shaking them down, that's what people are asking. That corruption is what they want corrected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians? Let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of it with terror.\" And the others who say, \"We know we should also use political means to dissolve it.\" So that is the problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So even as part of a two-state solution, they're still against the idea.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>right now, if you ask Israelis across the political spectrum, except the very hard left, most Israelis agree with that. They don't really debate it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a two-state solution where Israel controls the security of the entire region.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you can walk it in not one afternoon. If you're really fit, you can do it in a day, less than a day. I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the expansion of settlements in the West Bank has been a top priority for this new government. So people may harshly criticize this as contributing to escalating the Israel-Palestine tensions. Can you understand that perspective, that this expansion of settlements is not good for this two-state solution?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain, with Morocco and with Sudan. And we're now trying to expand that in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does it take to do that with Saudi Arabia, with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the press. But that idea is permeating and I think it's the right idea, because I think it's the only one that will work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So expanding the circle of peace, just to linger on that requires what? Secretly talking man-to-man, human-to-human, to leaders of other nations and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Theoretically, you're right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Theoretically. Okay. Well, let me ask you another theoretical question on this circle of peace. As a student of history, looking at the ideas of war and peace, what do you think can achieve peace in the war in Ukraine looking at another part of the world? If you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world, how can you apply that to that other part of the world between Russia and Ukraine now?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bring about an end to Ukraine? I have my ideas. I don't think that's worthwhile discussing them now because they might be required later on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you believe in the power of conversation? Since you have contacts with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in a room and discussing how the end of war can be brought about?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to get both sides to a point where they think that that conversation would lead to something useful. I don't think they're there right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What part of this is just basic human ego, stubbornness all of this between leaders, which is why I bring up the power of conversation, of sitting in a room realizing we're human beings, and then there's a history that connects Ukraine and Russia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what happens in the room. And there's a lot of pre-negotiations on the negotiation, then you negotiate endlessly on the negotiation. They're not even there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It took a lot of work for you to get to a handshake in the past.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that and never getting to paint on the larger canvas? I want to paint on the larger canvas and come back to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As you write about in your book, what have you learned about life from your father?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>things in university, or in college, or in Boston, or at MIT, and that's enough. I've done it.\" No, learn, learn, learn, learn. Never stop.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if I may suggest as part of the education, I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky, in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I read him, but I'll tell you what I think is bigger than Dostoevsky.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, no. Who's that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>read, read, read. And by the way, if I have to choose, I read history, history and history. Good works of history, not lousy books.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Last question. You've talked about a survival of a nation. You, yourself, are a mortal being. Do you contemplate your mortality? Do you contemplate your death? Are you afraid of death?<|eot_id|>"}
