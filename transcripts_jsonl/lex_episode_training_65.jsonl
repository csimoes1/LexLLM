The question is not how do you avoid getting scarred, it's how do you deal with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Walter Isaacson, one of the greatest biography writers ever, having written incredible books on Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, and now a new one on Elon Musk. We talked for hours, on and off the mic. I'm sure we'll talk many more times. Walter is a truly special writer, thinker, observer, and human being. I highly recommend people read his new book on Elon. I'm sure there will be short-term controversy, but in the long term, I think it will inspire millions of young people, especially with difficult childhoods, with hardship in their surroundings or in their own minds, to take on the hardest problems in the world and to build solutions to those problems, no matter how impossible the odds. In this conversation, Walter and I cover all of his books, and use personal stories from them to speak to the bigger principles of striving for greatness in science, in tech, engineering, art, politics and life. There are many things in the new Elon book that I felt are best saved for when I speak to Elon directly again on this podcast, which will be soon enough. Perhaps it's also good to mention here that my friendships, like with Elon, nor any other influence like money, access, fame, power, will never result in me sacrificing my integrity, ever. I do like to celebrate the good in people, to empathize and to understand, but I also like to call people out on their bullshit with respect and with compassion. If I fail, I fail due to a lack of skill, not a lack of integrity. I'll work hard to improve. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Walter Isaacson. What is the role of a difficult childhood in the lives of great men and women, great minds? Is it a requirement, is it a catalyst, or is it just a simple coincidence of fate?<|eot_id|>"}

And like you said, removing some of the bolts. So sometimes it's small things, but sometimes it's really big things like getting rid of radar.<|eot_id|>"}

This will be AI, but real world done by ingesting video.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sometimes it feels like he and others that are building things in this world successfully are basically confidently exploring a dark room with a very confident ambitious vision of what that room actually looks like. They're just walking straight into the darkness. There's no painful toys or legos on the ground. I'm just going to walk. I know exactly how far the wall is, and then very quickly willing to adjust as they run into, they step on the Lego and their body is filled with a lot of pain. What I mean by that is there's this kind of evolution that seems to happen where you discover really good ideas along the way that allow you to pivot. To me since a few years ago when you could see with Andrei Karpathy, the software 2.0 evolution of autopilot, it became obvious to me that this is not about the car. This is about Optimus, the robot. This is like if we look back a hundred years from now, the car will be remembered as a cool car, nice transportation, but the autopilot won't be the thing that controls the car. It'll be the thing that allows embodied AI systems to understand the world, so broadly. And so that kind of approach. And you kind of stumble into it, will Tesla be a car company? Will it be an AI company? Will it be a robotics company? Will it be a home robotics company? Will it be an energy company? And then you kind of slowly discover this as you confidently push forward with a vision. So it's interesting to watch that kind of evolution as long as it's backed by this confidence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tough part of that is real world AI and that's where Optimus, the robot or full self-drive are I think far ahead of anybody else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I like how you said chitchat. I would say for one of the greatest writers ever, it's funny you spoke about language and the mastery of languages as merely chitchat. People have fallen in love over some words. People have gone to wars over some words. I think words have a lot of power. It's actually an interesting question where the wisdom of the world, the wisdom of humanity is in the words or is it in visuals, is it in the physical? I don't really-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's in mathematics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe it all boils down to math and in the end, this kind of discussion about real world AI versus language is all the same. Maybe. I've gotten a chance to hang out quite a bit in the Metaverse with Mr. Mark Zuckerberg recently, and boy is the realism in there. The thing that's coming up in the future is incredible. I got scanned in Pittsburgh for 10 hours into the Metaverse and there's a virtual version of me and I got to hang out with that virtual version.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's the lack of the empathy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it made me start to question even more than before, well, how important is this physical reality? Because I got to see myself and other people in that metaverse, the details of the face, all the things that you think maybe if you look at yourself in the mirror are imperfections, all this kind of stuff of stuff. When I was looking at myself and at others, all those things are beautiful and it was real and it was intense and it was scary because you're like, well, are you allowed to murder people in the metaverse? What are you allowed to do? Because you can replicate a lot of those things and you start to question what are the fundamental things that make life worth living here as we know as humans.<|eot_id|>"}

So Elon's quote is to anyone I've offended, I just want to say, this is on SNL, I just want to say I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you also think I was going to be a chill normal dude? And then the quote from Steve Jobs of course is the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

Did he have to be so cruel?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and I didn't do it.

I wonder how true this is, it rings true. That you can just ask people, which camp are you in? Are you the kind of person that prizes themselves that enjoy staying up till 2:00 AM programming or whatever, or do you see the value of work-life balance, all this kind of stuff? And it's interesting, I mean people probably divide themselves in different stages of life and you could just ask them and it makes sense for certain companies at certain stages of their development to be like, we only want hardcore people.<|eot_id|>"}

Not just writing a biography, but understanding deeply, which your books have done for the human story and the bigger ideas underlying the human story.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm somewhat lucky because I started off working for a daily newspaper and people back then they wanted to talk to the newspaper reporter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you also have a way about you.

Some of the best conversations ever are probably somewhere in South America between two drunk people that we never get to hear.

But there's something when you talk about just one-on-one interaction, whether it's Elon or Steve Jobs or there's something beautiful about that person's mind, and it feels like it's possible to reveal that, to discover that together efficiently and that's kind of the goal of a conversation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was a Ben Franklin.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a very disarming method.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

But there, people have built up walls, whether it's because of demons or because of they're politicians, and so they have agendas and narratives and so on. And so to break through those, I wonder if there's some advice, some wisdom you've learned on how to wear down through water or whatever method the walls that we've built up as individuals.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In other words, you can't say, okay, there's a one-hour interview and I'm going to break down every wall.

Well, actually, there's one of the things that my situation, you learn, fifth visit is very nice, but sometimes you don't get a fifth visit. Sometimes it's just the first date. And I think what it boils down to, and we said disarming, but there's something about this person that you trust. I think a lot of it just boils down to trust in some deep human way. I think with many other people I've spoken with, sometimes the trust happens after the interview, which is really sad because it's like, oh man.<|eot_id|>"}

Let me ask you about objectivity. You followed Elon and you follow Steve, like you've, I don't even know if you would say your friend.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or I try to make that a minor consideration.

So I guess if you look at my books, they're not great inspiring guides to personal relationships.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about actually the process of writing itself.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>point I need to make next and so you start with a sentence that says, one day in January in the factory in Texas comma.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, one of the things I'd love to ask you is for advice for young people. To me, first advice would be to read biographies in the sense because they help you understand of all the different ways you can live a life well lived.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and that requires something that I did not have enough of when I was young, which is self-awareness and examining every motive, everything I do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where does the examination lead you? Is it to a shift in life trajectory?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what's motivating you and then you learn to ask, but is that really what I want?
