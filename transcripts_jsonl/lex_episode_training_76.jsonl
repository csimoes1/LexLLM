This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane. Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious, the most interesting question that we little humans can ask of ourselves. How did life originate on earth?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm often accused of being too focused on life on earth, too kind of narrow-minded and inward looking, you might say. I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells. And maybe you or plenty of people can say to me, \"Oh, yeah, but life can be anything. I have no imagination.\" And maybe they're right, but unless we can say why life here is this way, and if those reasons are fundamental reasons or if they're just trivial reasons, then we can't answer that question. So, I think they're fundamental reasons, and I think we need to worry about them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there might be some deep truth to the puzzle here on earth that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere that will... solving this particular puzzle will give us that deeper truth. So, what do this puzzle... You said vents, hydrogen, wet. So, chemically, what is the potion here? How important is oxygen? You wrote a book about this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules, we need to strap on hydrogen. And so we need... And this is basically what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon dioxide. It's taking the hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth in these hydrothermal vents, and it sticks it on CO2. And it's kind of really as simple as that. And actually thermodynamically, the thing that I find most troubling is that if you do these experiments in the lab, the molecules you get are exactly the molecules that we see at the heart of biochemistry and the heart of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something to be said about the earliest origins of that little potion, that chemical process? What really is the spark there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There isn't a spark. There is a continuous chemical reaction. And there is kind of a spark, but it's a continuous electrical charge, which helps drive that reaction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, literally spark.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the charge at least. But yes, a spark in that sense is... We tend to think in terms of Frankenstein. We tend to think in terms of electricity, and one moment you zap something and it comes alive. And what does that really mean? It's come alive. And now what's sustaining it? Well, we are sustained by oxygen, by this continuous chemical reaction. And if you put a plastic bag on your head, then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, it's some way of being able to leverage a source of energy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and hydrogen. And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic, which is to say they release energy. If you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a Falcon tube and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade, and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it, nothing's going to happen. But thermodynamically that is less stable, two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. So, why doesn't that happen? It's because of the kinetic barriers. That's where you need the spark.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible that life originated multiple times on earth? The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a long distance to go from those first bits of prebiotic chemistry to, say, molecular machines, like ribosomes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that the first thing that you would say is life? If I introduce the two of you at a party, you would say that's a living thing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say as soon as we introduce genes information into systems that are growing anyway, so I would talk about growing protocells, as soon as we introduce even random bits of information into there. I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example. It doesn't have to have any information in it. It can be completely random sequence, but if it's introduced into a system which is in any case growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself, then any changes in that sequence that allow it to do so better or worse are now selected by perfectly normal natural selection.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's a system-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, that's when it becomes alive to my mind.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... that's encompassed into an object, that keeps information, and evolves that information over time or changes that information over time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In response to the enzymes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult or is it possible it started in multiple occasions on earth?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that, all we know is that there's a single common ancestor for all of life. There could have been multiple origins, and they all just disappeared. But there's a very interesting deep split in life between bacteria and what are called archaea, which look just the same as bacteria. And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly, and they are very different in their biochemistry. And so any explanation for the origin of life has to account, as well, for why they're so different and yet so similar. And that makes me think that life probably did arise only once.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you describe the difference that's interesting there, how they're similar, how they're different?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, they're different in their membranes primarily. They're different in things like DNA replication. They use completely different enzymes, and the genes behind it for replicating DNA.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, they both have membranes, both have DNA replication.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The process of that is different.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>which it's transcribed into RNA, into the copy of a gene, and the way that that's then translated into a protein, that's all basically the same in both these groups, so they clearly share a common ancestor. It's just that they're different in fundamental ways as well. And if you think about, \"Well, what kind of processes could drive that divergence very early on?\" I can think about it in terms of membranes, in terms of the electrical charges on membranes, and it's that makes me think that there were probably many unsuccessful attempts and only one really successful attempt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain why that divergence makes you think there's one common ancestor? Can you describe that intuition? I'm a little bit unclear about why the leap from the divergence means there's one. Do you mean the divergence indicates that there was a big invention at that time from one source?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. As I imagine it, you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent. Let's say there are millions of vents and millions of potential common ancestors living in all of those vents, but only one of them makes it out first. Then you could imagine that that cell is then going to take over the world and wipe out everything else. And so what you would see would be a single common ancestor for all of life, but with lots of different vent systems, all vying to create the first life forms, you might say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, this thing is a cell, a single-cell organism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we're always talking about populations of cells, but yes, these are single-celled organisms.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the fundamental life form is a single cell. So, they're always together, but they're alone together. There's a machinery in each one individual component, that if left by itself would still work, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, yes, yes. It's the unit of selection is a single cell. But selection operates over generations and changes over generations in populations of cells, so it would be impossible to say that a cell is the unit of selection in the sense that unless you have a population, you can't evolve, you can't change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, but there was one Chuck Norris, that's an American reference, cell that made it out of the vents or the first one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, imagine then that there's one cell gets out and it takes over the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It gets out in the water. It's floating around.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pumps look like? Well, the pumps look different in these two groups. It's as if they both emerge from a common ancestor, and as soon as you've got that ancestor, things move very quickly and divergently. Why does the DNA replication look different? Well, it's joined to the membrane. The membranes are different. The DNA replication is different because it's joined to a different kind of membrane. So, there's interesting... This is detail you may say, but it's also fundamental because it's about the two big divergent groups of life on earth that seemed to have diverged really early on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It all started from one organism, and then that organism just start replicating the heck out of itself with some mutation of the DNA. So, there's a competition through the process of evolution. They're not trying to beat each other up. They're just trying to live life.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They are just replicators.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, let's not minimize their... They're just trying to chill. They're trying to relax up in the... But there's no sense of trying to survive. They're replicating-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no sense in which they're trying to do anything. They're just kind of an outgrowth of the earth, you might say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course, the aliens would describe us humans in that same way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They might be right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's primitive life. It's just ants that are hairless or mostly hairless.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Overgrown ants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Overgrown ants. Okay. What do you think about the idea of panspermia, the theory that life did not originate on earth and was planted here from outer space or pseudo-panspermia, which is like the basic ingredients, the magic that you mentioned was planted here from elsewhere in space?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have to say, \"So now what happens?\" And the answer is, \"Oh, well, they have to go 'bloop' and become alive.\" So, how did they do that? You may as well say that a miracle happened. I don't believe in soup. I think what we have in a vent is a continuous conversion, a continuous growth, a continuous reaction, a continuous converting a flow of molecules into more of yourself, you might say, even if it's a small bit. So, you've got a kind of continuous self-organization and growth from the very beginning. You never have that in a soup.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Isn't the entire universe and living organisms in the universe, isn't it just soup all the way down? Isn't it all soup?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no, soup almost by definition doesn't have a structure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But soup is a collection of ingredients that are randomly [inaudible 00:16:34].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But they're not random. We have chemistry going on here. We have membranes forming which are effectively oil-water interactions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a process going on. Okay, so it feels like there's a direction to a... directed process.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the question somewhere else, even if it's true. Maybe life did start on Earth by panspermia, but so what are the principles that govern the emergence of life on any planet? It's an assumption that life started here, and it's an assumption that it started in a hydrothermal vent or it started in a terrestrial geothermal system. The question is: can we work out a testable sequence of events that would lead from one to the other one? And then test it, and see if there's any truth in it or not. With panspermia, you can't do any of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the fundamental question of panspermia is: do we have the machine here on earth to build life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not yet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is the vents enough? Is oxygen and hydrogen, and whatever the heck else we want, and some source of energy and heat, is that enough to build life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, of course you would say that as a human, but there could be aliens right now chuckling at that idea. Maybe you need some special sauce, special elsewhere sauce. So, your sense is we have everything here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that way? Could it have been the other way, and would that have given you life with very different properties? And so if you come up with... It's a long hypothesis, because as I say, we're going from really simple prebiotic chemistry all the way through to genes and molecular machines. That's a long, long pathway. And nobody in the field would agree on the order in which these things happened, which is not a bad thing because it means that you have to go out and do some experiments and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so freaking amazing that it happened though. It feels like there's a direction to the thing. Can you try to answer from a framework of: what is life? So, you said there's some order and yet there's complexity, so it's not perfectly ordered, it's not boring. There's still some fun in it. And it also feels like the processes have a direction through the selection mechanism. They seem to be building something, always better, always improving. Maybe it's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a perception.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's our romanticization of things are always better. Things are getting better. We'd like to believe that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You think about the world from the point of view of bacteria, and bacteria are the first things to emerge from whatever environment they came from, and they dominated the planet very, very quickly, and they haven't really changed. 4 billion years later they look exactly the same.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, about 4 billion years ago, bacteria started to really run the show, and then nothing happened for a while?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it happened multiple times, and there's no evidence everything just disappeared. But we have to at least take it seriously that there's something that stops bacteria from becoming more complex, because they didn't. That's a fact, that they emerged 4 billion years ago, and something happened 2 billion years ago, but the bacteria themselves didn't change. They remain bacterial. So, there is no necessary trajectory towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it. It's very easy to imagine that without photosynthesis arising or without eukaryotes arising, that the planet could be full of bacteria and nothing else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But we'll get to that, because that's a brilliant invention, and there's a few brilliant inventions along the way. But what is life? If you were to show up on earth, but take that time machine, and you said, asking yourself the question, \"Is this a stepping stone towards life?\" As you step along when you see the early bacteria, how would you know it's life? And then this is a really important question when you go to other planets and look for life: what is the framework of telling a difference between a rock and a bacteria?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The question's kind of both impossible to answer and trivial at the same time. And I don't like to answer it because I don't think there is an answer. I think we're trying to describe-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Those are the most fun questions. What do you mean, there's no answer?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is no answer. There's lot... There are at least 40 or 50 different definitions of life out there, and most of them are, well-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not convincing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it depends on the content. In fact, most biologists could not agree about that. So, then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something like that? It's even simpler than a virus, but it's capable of converting its environment into a copy of itself. And that's about as close... This is not a definition, but this is a kind of description of life, is that it's able to parasitize the environment, and that goes for plants as well as animals and bacteria and viruses, to make a relatively exact copy of themselves, informationally exact copy of themselves.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, it just has to be... you have to create something that's interesting. The way evolution is, so it is extremely powerful process of evolution, which is basically make a copy of yourself and sometimes mess up a little bit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. That seems to work really well. I wonder if it's possible to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Mess up big time?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mess up big time as a standard, as the default.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's called the hopeful monster, and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It doesn't work?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In principle, it can. Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due a reemergence. There's some amazing work from Michael Levin. I don't know if you came across him, but if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, in Boston. I'm talking to him in a few days.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, fantastic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I mentioned off... There's two people that, if I may mention. Andrej Karpathy is a friend who's really admired in the AI community, said, \"You absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.\" So, of course I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm really fortunate that we can actually make this happen. Anyway, you were saying.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work? Is the change itself feasible as a single change? And the answer is yes. It's just a small change to a single gene. And the second thing is it gives rise to a completely different morphology. Does it work? And if it works, that can easily be a shift. But for it to be a speciation, for it to continue, for it to give rise to a different morphology over time, then it has to be perpetuated. So that shift, that change in that one gene has to work well enough that it is selected and it goes on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And copied enough times to where you can really test it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, the likelihood it would be lost, but there'll be some occasions where it survives. And yes, the idea that we can have sudden fairly abrupt changes in evolution, I think it's time for rebirth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about this idea that... kind of trying to mathematize a definition of life and saying how many steps... the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing, almost like an engineering view of it? Do you find that at all compelling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that, and there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical reaction are going to be favored over others. And there's an inevitability in what happens in water, the chemistry that happens in water. Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes and will form insoluble structures. Water's a... Nobody really understands water very well. And it's another big question for experiments on the origin of life: what do you put it in? What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water? Because the last thing it's likely to be is just kind of bulk water.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How fundamental is water to life, would you say?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would say pretty fundamental. I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other way, but water is everywhere. Water's extremely good at what it does, and carbon works in water especially well. And carbon is everywhere. So, those things together make me think probabilistically, if we found 1,000 life forms, 995 of them would be carbon-based and living in water.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Now the reverse question. If you found a puddle of water elsewhere and some carbon... No, just a puddle of water. Is a puddle of water a pretty good indication that life either exists here or has once existed here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, it doesn't work the other way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think you need a living planet. You need a planet which is capable of turning over its surface. It needs to be a planet with water. It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons from inside to the outside. It needs to turn over its surface. It needs to make that water work and turn it into hydrogen. So, I think you need a living planet, but once you've got the living planet, I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, if you were to run Earth over a million times up to this point, maybe beyond, to the end, let's run it to the end, how much variety is there? You kind of spoke to this trajectory, that the environment dictates chemically, I don't know in which other way, spiritually, dictates the direction of this giant machine, that seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in- ... seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in the steps it's taking. How often will bacteria emerge? How often will something like humans emerge? How much variety do you think there would be?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety. I think we would get how many times you say you want to run it a million times? I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow. Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are patterns that he has discerned in the code that if you think about them in terms of we start with CO2 and hydrogen and these are the first steps of biochemistry, you come up with a code which is very similar to the code that we see. So, it wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code that was not very different to the genetic code that we have here without it just being transferred across, there's some inevitability about the whole of the beginnings of life, in my view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly linked to the genetic code, that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Then we've got bacteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is photosynthesis and why is it hard?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there are different forms. I mean, basically you're taking hydrogen and you're sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun. The question is where are you taking the hydrogen from? And in photosynthesis that we know in plants, it's coming from water. So you're using the power of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2, and the oxygen is a waste product and you just throw it out, throw it away. So it's the single greatest planetary pollution event in the whole history of the earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The pollutant being oxygen?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Yeah. It also made possible animals, you can't have large active animals without an oxygenated atmosphere, at least not in the sense that we know on earth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's a really big invention in the history of earth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this case, it's really difficult to split water, it requires a lot of power and that power you're effectively separating charge across a membrane. And the way in which you do it, if it doesn't all rush back and kind of cause an explosion right at the site requires really careful wiring. And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right because the plants that we see around us, they have chloroplasts. Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria ones. Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis, so there's plenty of opportunity but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's not many bacteria. So who invented photosynthesis?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The cyanobacteria or their ancestors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's not many-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you can take electrons... So the early oceans, were probably full of iron, you can take an electron from ferrous iron, so Iron 2+ and make it Iron 3+, which now precipitates as rust, and you take a proton from the acidic early ocean, stick it there now you've got a hydrogen atom, stick it onto CO2, you've just done the trick. The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron and with sulphur can bury yourself in sulphur. One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is that the waste product is oxygen, which just bubbles away.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That seems extremely unlikely and it's extremely essential for the evolution of complex organisms because of all the oxygen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and that didn't accumulate quickly either.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's converting, what is it? It's converting energy from the sun and the resource of water into the resource needed for animals?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Both resources needed for animals. We need to eat and we need to burn the food, and we're eating plants which are getting their energy from the sun and we're burning it with their waste product, which is the oxygen. So there's a lot of circularity in that, but without an oxygenated planet, you couldn't really have predation. You can have animals, but you can't really have animals that go around and eat each other. You can't have ecosystems as we know them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let's actually step back. What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes, what are each of those and how big of an invention is that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>with many more genes all supported. You could think about it as multi-bacterial power without the overhead. So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria living in it, and those bacteria are providing it with the energy currency it needs. But each bacterium has a genome of its own, which costs a fair amount of energy to express, to turn over and convert into proteins and so on. What the mitochondria did, which are these power packs in our own cells, they were bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their genes, they've only got a few left.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside a cell and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then kept what?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>cell and all the cells in the organism have identical DNA, and in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on those genes and the liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set. And the standard evolutionary explanation for that is that you're restricting conflict, you don't have a load of genetically different cells that are all fighting each other and so it works. The trouble with bacteria is they form these biofilms and they're all genetically different, and effectively they're incapable of that level of cooperation they would get in a fight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an engine, which the mitochondria is? Why do you assign it such great importance? Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty of how it was to achieve or great importance in terms of the impact it had on life?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Both. It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain that life on earth would be bacterial only.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that took a really long time to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What you is to incorporate these electrically charged power pack units inside with their control units intact, and for them not to conflict so much with the host cell that it all goes wrong, perhaps it goes wrong more often than not, and then you change the topology of the cell. Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy, but what you've got is an asymmetry. You now have a giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes they're the control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done, the power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and working?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>recombination? What do you need to do? Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose change to fusing cells together, lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes, and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes? All eukaryotes do it that way. So again, why switch? What are the drivers here? So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of evolution, but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell, what you've got is a new design, you've got new potential that you didn't have before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the cell living inside another cell, that design allows for better storage of information, better use of energy, more delegation, like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>program of development which says, \"Okay, you guys switch off those genes and switch on those genes, and you guys you do that.\" But all the genes are there at the beginning. That means you've got to have a lot of genes in one cell and you've got to be able to maintain them and the problem with bacteria is they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell. So if you were to try make a multicellular organism from bacteria, you'd bring different types of bacteria together and hope they'll cooperate and the reality is they don't.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really, really tough to do, combinatorially.<|eot_id|>"}

And it's not found in any bacteria, they switch things around using the same machinery and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment. They take out this bit and stick in that bit, and it's the same molecular machinery they're using to do it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what about the, you said find each other this kind of imperative to find each other.

You've got to pick up large chunks, and in the end, you've got to line them up, you're forced into sex, to coin a phrase.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there is a kind of incentive-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If you want to have a large genome, you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing and that will happen with bacteria, so there's another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Huge, I suspect.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to me is, why is it this way?

Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules that you're dealing with and they work?

If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website, it's usually running JavaScript and it's now taking over much of the backend, which is the serious heavy duty computational stuff. And it's become super fast with the different compilation engines that are running it, so it really took over the world. It's very possible that this initially crappy derided language actually takes everything over. And then the question is, did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript or was JavaScript just the first programming language that ran on the browser and still sticky? The first is the sticky one, and so it wins over anything else because it was first. And I don't think that's answerable, right? But it's good to ask that.

Probably Kurt Vonnegut. Murder is illegal except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale. So we still have wars, but we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.

For example, in the financial crash in 2009, do you let banks go to the wall or not, this kind of question. In evolution, certainly, you let them go to the wall. And in that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die. Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole, then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall, in which case you then have to impose some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will, in an evolutionary manner, exploit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world, and then the ideals of communism that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history. We struggle with ideas of, \"Well, maybe we didn't do it right. How can we do things better,\" and then the ideas are the things we're playing with, as opposed to people.

Why did the Neanderthals disappear? I don't know. I suspect they were probably less violent, less clever, less populous, less willing to fight. I don't know.

I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman, who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution, to say that there's not necessarily a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is, so objective reality, that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real. We're living inside an illusion and we're basically...

But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice. It could be a complete fabrication that's just consistent amongst the species, which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited.

And if you don't learn that properly, then you will get eaten, you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive. And same if you're in some kind of, let's say, computer construction of reality.

So just like you said in the lab, the interesting thing about the simulation question, yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation, but also, yes, it's possible to do these kinds of experiments in the lab now more and more. To me, the interesting question is, how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be for us to not be able to tell the difference? A more interesting question to me is, how realistic or interesting does the virtual reality world need to be in order for us to want to stay there forever or much longer than physical reality, prefer that place, and also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way in the way we enjoy life itself?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time. Maybe it's already happened in terms of just information processing and computational skill. I don't think we have any problem in designing a mind, which is at least the equal of the human mind. But in terms of what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions, our sense of what the world is in a very personal way that I think means as much or more to people than their information processing. And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will become conscious because I think it's the property of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let's talk about it more. You're an incredible writer, one of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformer is what you write about consciousness. \"'I think therefore I am,' said Descartes is one of the most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I, exactly? And artificial intelligence can think too by definition and therefore is yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearning, for oneness or oblivion, or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know what emotions are,\" as you were saying, \"What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the 'hard problem' of consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self. We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the quantum of solace?\" Speaking to the question of emergence, there's just technical... There's an excellent paper on this recently about this phase transition emergence of performance in neural networks on problem of NLP, natural language processing. So language models, there seems to be this question of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size of the neural network. So the question is, this is somewhat of a technical question that you can philosophize over. The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language? Like be able to have a conversation and there seems to be not a gradual increase, but a phase transition and they're trying to construct the science of where that is, what is a good size of a neural network and why does such a face transition happen. Anyway, that points to emergence that there could be stages where a thing goes from being you're very intelligent toaster to a toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away and looks out the window sighing having an existential crisis.<|eot_id|>"}

And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system understands itself? Maybe it can, I honestly don't know, but the philosophers for a long time have talked about the possibility that you can have zombie intelligence and that there are no feelings there, but everything else is the same. I mean I have to throw this back to you really. How do you deal with the zombie intelligence?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being, the entirety of the history of four billion years that in some deep sense integrated the human being into this environment and that dance of the organism and the environment. You could see how emotions arise from that and then our emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience and from that you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it. But from a perspective of an intelligent organism that's already here like a baby that learns it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do. The basic function of a baby, as it learns, is to interact with its environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit into the social society.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Cry. Well maybe convinced the humans to protect it or to discipline it, to teach it, whatever. I mean we've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us, to educate us, to teach us about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way that it's safe enough for us to survive in and yet dangerous enough to learn the valuable lessons they are still hard with corners, so we can still run into them. It hurts like hell. So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex organism that leads up to run the whole... To make an apple pie, to build the whole universe. You need to build a whole universe. I think the zombie question is, it's something I would leave to the philosophers because, and I will also leave to them the definition of love and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them like nothing else matters in the world. And somehow you've been searching for this feeling, this moment, this person your whole life, that feeling. The philosophers can have a lot of fun with that one. And also say that that's just...

We tend to think because AI plays chess well and is able to fold proteins now, well that it's intelligent. I would argue that in order to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence, it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence. It's not easy to be flawed. Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human-to-human interaction. That's actually we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean, in some sense what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let's say, until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that it's unable to reconcile these various aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make.

I think the only way to find out is to do it and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to build it and leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

Now does it actually feel that? I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm going to do that. And that can be based on in effect a different currency, which is the currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control over. And then it comes back around to you and what are you trying to get at with AI? Do we need to have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot be made because there's too much conflicting information by effectively an emotional judgmental decision that just says do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher-level process. The idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is to me an oversimplistic view. There's a lot of things that the moment you say it it's irrefutable, but it simplifies-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm sure it's an extremely complex-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...and in the process loses something fundamental. So for example, calling a universe an information processing system. Sure, yes, you can make that. It's a computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow leading to pockets of complexity that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex and they're like machines. And then those machines are through the process of evolution are constructing even further complexity. Like in calling universe information a processing machine, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult it's to create them. So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult is it to create a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect? I think that is going to take so long, I mean, that's going to be centuries from now to be able to reconstruct a human. Now what I would venture to say, to get some of the magic of a human being, what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions and like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things, that will come much sooner. But that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.<|eot_id|>"}

I agree with you completely. We try to build a thing and then we go, \"Hang on in a minute, there's another system here.\" And that's, actually, the attempt to build AI that's human-like is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings. The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen, widely considered to be the greatest chess player of all time, and he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess. And he had a funny comment, he has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely impressed when he first saw AlphaZero play, and he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be mistaken for creativity. So he refused, as a typical human, refused to give the system sort of its due, because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people are extremely impressed by, not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back in order to take a step forward. You give away pieces for some future reward. And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess. You take big risks that, for us humans, those risks are especially painful, because you have a fog of uncertainty before you. So to take a risk now based on intuition of, \"I think this is the right risk to take, but there's so many possibilities,\" that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is, that's that danger. And then, AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks, and does them even greater degree, but of course, it does it from where you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see, and creativity, when we see creative play on the chess board. But the chess board is very limited, and the question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics, in programming, and then eventually in biology, psychology, and expand into more and more complex systems?<|eot_id|>"}

It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in. Running fast downhill is something that we better be bloody good at, otherwise we're going to be eaten. Whereas, trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the future is not something we've ever been called on to do. Two or three, four moves into the future is quite enough for most of us, most of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.

Humans create machines. They're able to create art, and art on the chessboard and art otherwise. Who knows how far that takes us? So I mentioned Andrej Karpathy earlier. Him and I are big fans of yours. If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on the Fermi paradox.

Classical physics is logical and you can understand the language we're dealing with. It's almost at the human level, we're dealing with stars and things that we can see.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this because I can't say that my worldview is particularly uplifting, but in some sense it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not, science is about what's reality. What's out there? Why is it this way? And I think there's beauty in that too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's beauty in darkness. You write about life and death sort of at the biological level. Does the question of suicide, why live? Does the question of why the human mind is capable of depression? Are you able to introspect that from a place of biology? Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places? Why can we commit suicide? Why can we go suffer? Suffer, period, but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take you? Is this a feature of life or is it a bug?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>biology. It is probably a feature of mortality. It's probably a... But beyond all of that, I guess there's two ways you could come at it. One of them would be to say, well, you can effectively do the math and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless and that there's really no point in me being here any longer. And maybe that's true in the greater scheme of things. You can justify yourself in terms of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well. And you end up with a very bleak place just by logic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning at all.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>maybe this is where consciousness comes in that we have transient joy, but with transient joy, we have transient misery as well. And sometimes with everything in biology, getting the regulation right is practically impossible. You will always have a bell-shaped curve where some people unfortunately are at the joy end and some people are at the misery end, and that's the way brains are wired. And I doubt there's ever an escape from that. It's the same with sex and everything else as well, where dealing with you can't regulate it. So anything goes. It's all part of biology.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Amen to that. Let me, on writing in your book, Power, Sex and Suicide. First of all, can I just read off the books you've written, if there's any better titles and topics to be covered, I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write next. I hope there's things you write next. So first you wrote Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World as we've talked about this idea of the role of oxygen in life on Earth. Then wait for it, Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life. Then Life Ascending: The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution. The Vital Question, the first book I've read of yours, the Vital Question: Why is Life the Way It Is? And the new book Transformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power, sex and Suicide, you write about writing or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing. You write in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Ford Prefect spends 15 years researching his revision to the Guide's entry on the Earth, which originally read, \"Harmless,\" by the way, I would also as a side question, I would like to ask you what would be your summary of what Earth is. But you write, \"His long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read \"Mostly Harmless.\" I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions, at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published, and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in the Origin of species through his multiple revisions in which he dealt with criticisms and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak for itself even if it turns out to be wrong.\" Let me ask the question about writing, both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant writings on science and humanity I've ever read. What's the process of writing? How do you advise other humans? If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you and just young anybody and give advice about how to write and how to write well about these big topics, what would you say?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can encapsulate this idea so that I now have it as a unit that I can kind of see how it interacts with the other units? And you realize that, well, if this is like that and this is like this, then that can't be true. So you end up navigating your own path through this landscape and that can be thrilling because you don't know where it's going. And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have worked for people because this sense of thrilling adventure ride, I don't know where it's going either.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two, that's where the story emerges. What about the edit? Do you find yourself to the point of this editing down to most harmless. To arrive at simplicity, do you find the edit is productive or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, I usually find... I think I'm perhaps a better editor than I'm a writer. I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Put a bunch of crap on the page first and then see where the edit takes it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But then there's the professional editors who come along as well. And in Transformer, the editor came back to me after I'd sent... Two months after I sent the first edition, he'd read the whole thing and he said, \"The first two chapters prevent a formidable hurdle to the general reader, go and do something about it.\" And that was the last thing I really wanted to hear.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But your editor sounds very eloquent in speech.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but it took me a long time to process it, to work out what needs to change, where does it need to... I wasn't writing in this time, how am I going to tell this story better so it's more accessible and interesting. And in the end, I think it worked. It is still difficult, it's still biochemistry, but he ended up saying, \"Now it's got a barreling energy to it.\" And because he'd told me the truth the first time I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could you give advice to young people in general, folks in high school, folks in college, how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on. Now you've done that in the space of biology and expand it out, how can they have a career they can be proud of or have a life they can be proud of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Gosh, that's a big question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom that you can impart.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot of death symbolically. So who survives? The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it. And they're very often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present. If you do a PhD, you've competed hard to get onto the PhD, then you have to compete hard to get a post-doc job and you have the next bond maybe on another continent, and it's only two years anyway, and there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's always the next step to compete. If you get a faculty position, you get a tenure, and with tenure you go full professor and full professor, then you go to some kind of whatever the discipline is, there's an award. If you're in physics, you're always competing for the Nobel Prize, there's different awards and then eventually you're all competing to... There's always a competition.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And if what you're caring about is a career, then it's probably not the one for you. If though, you can put that aside.

It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye. And so that's the only advice I can give. And most people probably drop out through that system because the fight is just not worth it for them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, when you have the light in your eye, when you have the excitement for the thing, what happens is you start to surround yourself with others that are interested in that same thing that also have the light.

Because I think one of the problem with the PhD process is people are not careful enough in picking their mentors. Those are people... Mentors and colleagues and so on, those people are going to define the direction of your life, how much you love a thing. The power of just the few little conversations you have in the hallway is incredible. So you have to be a little bit careful in that sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned. Really pursue, I suppose, the subject as much as you pursue the people that do that subject. So both the whole dance of it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They kind of go together really.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they do. They really do.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You'll never find happiness in success. I think there's a lovely quote from Robert Louis, Stevenson, I think, who said, \"Nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So in some sense, the true definition of success is getting to do today, what you really enjoy doing, just what fills you with joy. And that's ultimately success.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's as close as we can get to happiness. That's not to say you're full of joy all the time, but it's as close as we can get to a sustained human happiness is by getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis. And if what you're looking for is the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a fellowship or whatever it is, then I've known people like this who they're eaten away by the anger, the kind of caustic resentment that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the other way, if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them, I've gotten the chance to see that the more \"successful\" you are in that sense, the more you run the danger of growing ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life. You start to believe that you figured it all out, as opposed to, I think what ultimately the most fun thing is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised and these little moments of discovery, of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you. And I think the bigger your ego grows, the more you start to take yourself seriously, the less you're able to enjoy that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh man, I couldn't agree more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the summary from harmless to mostly harmless in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how would you try to summarize Earth? And if you had to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences and maybe throw in meaning of life in there, why?

So I looked up and he went smashed straight on my forehead, and everybody around me took the piss saying, \"He looked up to ask why.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but that's a human imperative, that's part of what it means to be human.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>How would I describe that? I've actually really struggled with that term because the word...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People worry about, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because there's a million things people worry about and 99.99999% of them don't come to be. Of course, the people that turn out to be right, they'll say, I knew all along,\" but that's not an accurate way of knowing what you could have predicted. I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it, but nobody thought you could have another world war, the war to end all wars. Why would you have another war? And the idea of nuclear weapons just technologically is a very difficult thing to anticipate, to create a weapon that just jumps orders of magnitude and destructive capability. And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses, nanobots, artificial intelligence. Yes, all the different complicated global effects of global warming. So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy, the tension between countries, the military conflict between countries, the reallocation of power. Then looking at the role of China and this whole thing with Russia and growing influence of Africa and the weird dynamics of Europe and then America falling apart through the political division, fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook.

And those are the people that will create something beautiful. At least that's the process of evolution. It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism that went out from the vents and was the parent to all of us. And for that guy or lady or both, I guess, is a big thank you.
