And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will become conscious because I think it's the property of life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let's talk about it more. You're an incredible writer, one of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformer is what you write about consciousness. \"'I think therefore I am,' said Descartes is one of the most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I, exactly? And artificial intelligence can think too by definition and therefore is yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle of anything resembling human emotions, of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearning, for oneness or oblivion, or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know what emotions are,\" as you were saying, \"What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the 'hard problem' of consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self. We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the quantum of solace?\" Speaking to the question of emergence, there's just technical... There's an excellent paper on this recently about this phase transition emergence of performance in neural networks on problem of NLP, natural language processing. So language models, there seems to be this question of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size of the neural network. So the question is, this is somewhat of a technical question that you can philosophize over. The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language? Like be able to have a conversation and there seems to be not a gradual increase, but a phase transition and they're trying to construct the science of where that is, what is a good size of a neural network and why does such a face transition happen. Anyway, that points to emergence that there could be stages where a thing goes from being you're very intelligent toaster to a toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away and looks out the window sighing having an existential crisis.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but everything else is the same. I mean I have to throw this back to you really. How do you deal with the zombie intelligence?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being, the entirety of the history of four billion years that in some deep sense integrated the human being into this environment and that dance of the organism and the environment. You could see how emotions arise from that and then our emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience and from that you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it. But from a perspective of an intelligent organism that's already here like a baby that learns it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do. The basic function of a baby, as it learns, is to interact with its environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit into the social society.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Cry. Well maybe convinced the humans to protect it or to discipline it, to teach it, whatever. I mean we've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us, to educate us, to teach us about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way that it's safe enough for us to survive in and yet dangerous enough to learn the valuable lessons they are still hard with corners, so we can still run into them. It hurts like hell. So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex organism that leads up to run the whole... To make an apple pie, to build the whole universe. You need to build a whole universe. I think the zombie question is, it's something I would leave to the philosophers because, and I will also leave to them the definition of love and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them like nothing else matters in the world. And somehow you've been searching for this feeling, this moment, this person your whole life, that feeling. The philosophers can have a lot of fun with that one. And also say that that's just... You could have a biological explanation, you could have all kinds of... It's all fake. It's actually Ayn Rand will say it's all selfish. There's a lot of different interpretations. I'll leave it to the philosophers. The point is the feeling sure as hell feels very real. And if my toaster makes me feel like it's the only toaster in the world, and when I leave and I miss the toaster and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster and my life is meaningful and joyful and the friends I have around me get a better version of me because that toaster exists.

We tend to think because AI plays chess well and is able to fold proteins now, well that it's intelligent. I would argue that in order to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence, it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence. It's not easy to be flawed. Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human-to-human interaction. That's actually we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be how it works. I think the only way to find out is to do it and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to build it and leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>information by effectively an emotional judgmental decision that just says do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher-level process. The idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is to me an oversimplistic view. There's a lot of things that the moment you say it it's irrefutable, but it simplifies-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm sure it's an extremely complex-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...and in the process loses something fundamental. So for example, calling a universe an information processing system. Sure, yes, you can make that. It's a computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow leading to pockets of complexity that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex and they're like machines. And then those machines are through the process of evolution are constructing even further complexity. Like in calling universe information a processing machine, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult it's to create them. So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult is it to create a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect? I think that is going to take so long, I mean, that's going to be centuries from now to be able to reconstruct a human. Now what I would venture to say, to get some of the magic of a human being, what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions and like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things, that will come much sooner. But that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.<|eot_id|>"}

I agree with you completely. We try to build a thing and then we go, \"Hang on in a minute, there's another system here.\" And that's, actually, the attempt to build AI that's human-like is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings. The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen, widely considered to be the greatest chess player of all time, and he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess. And he had a funny comment, he has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely impressed when he first saw AlphaZero play, and he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be mistaken for creativity. So he refused, as a typical human, refused to give the system sort of its due, because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people are extremely impressed by, not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back in order to take a step forward. You give away pieces for some future reward. And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess. You take big risks that, for us humans, those risks are especially painful, because you have a fog of uncertainty before you. So to take a risk now based on intuition of, \"I think this is the right risk to take, but there's so many possibilities,\" that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is, that's that danger. And then, AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks, and does them even greater degree, but of course, it does it from where you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see, and creativity, when we see creative play on the chess board. But the chess board is very limited, and the question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics, in programming, and then eventually in biology, psychology, and expand into more and more complex systems?<|eot_id|>"}

First of all, can I just read off the books you've written, if there's any better titles and topics to be covered, I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write next. I hope there's things you write next. So first you wrote Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World as we've talked about this idea of the role of oxygen in life on Earth. Then wait for it, Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life. Then Life Ascending: The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution. The Vital Question, the first book I've read of yours, the Vital Question: Why is Life the Way It Is? And the new book Transformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power, sex and Suicide, you write about writing or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing. You write in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Ford Prefect spends 15 years researching his revision to the Guide's entry on the Earth, which originally read, \"Harmless,\" by the way, I would also as a side question, I would like to ask you what would be your summary of what Earth is. But you write, \"His long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read \"Mostly Harmless.\" I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions, at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published, and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in the Origin of species through his multiple revisions in which he dealt with criticisms and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak for itself even if it turns out to be wrong.\" Let me ask the question about writing, both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant writings on science and humanity I've ever read.

The power of just the few little conversations you have in the hallway is incredible. So you have to be a little bit careful in that sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned.

You start to believe that you figured it all out, as opposed to, I think what ultimately the most fun thing is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised and these little moments of discovery, of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>People worry about, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because there's a million things people worry about and 99.99999% of them don't come to be. Of course, the people that turn out to be right, they'll say, I knew all along,\" but that's not an accurate way of knowing what you could have predicted. I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it, but nobody thought you could have another world war, the war to end all wars. Why would you have another war? And the idea of nuclear weapons just technologically is a very difficult thing to anticipate, to create a weapon that just jumps orders of magnitude and destructive capability. And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses, nanobots, artificial intelligence. Yes, all the different complicated global effects of global warming. So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy, the tension between countries, the military conflict between countries, the reallocation of power. Then looking at the role of China and this whole thing with Russia and growing influence of Africa and the weird dynamics of Europe and then America falling apart through the political division, fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook. The whole beautiful mess is just fun. And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers, incredible scientists, incredible human beings, that while everyone is bickering and so on online for the fun of it, on the weekends, they're actually trying to build solutions. And those are the people that will create something beautiful. At least that's the process of evolution. It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism that went out from the vents and was the parent to all of us. And for that guy or lady or both, I guess, is a big thank you.
