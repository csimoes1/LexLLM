{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Javier Milei, the president of Argentina. He is a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, and economist, who campaigned with a chainsaw that symbolized his promise to slash the corrupt bureaucracy of the state. He stepped into the presidency one year ago, with a country on the brink of hyperinflation, deepened debt and suffering from mass unemployment and poverty. He took this crisis head on, transforming one of Latin America's largest economies through pure free market principles. In just a few months in office, he already achieved Argentina's first fiscal surplus in 16 years, and not just avoided the hyperinflation but brought inflation down to its lowest in three years. We discuss all of this in detail, both the successes and the challenges. His depth of knowledge of economic principles, metrics and data was truly impressive and refreshing to hear from a world leader. But even bigger than the economic transformation of Argentina, Javier represents the universal fight against government corruption and the fight for freedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and freedom of speech. He has many critics, many of whom a part of the corrupt establishment he's seeking to dismantle, but many are simply Argentinian citizens, scared of the pain his radical policies may bring, at least in the short term. But whether one disagrees with his methods or not, no one can deny that his presidency marks one of the most ambitious attempts at economic transformation in modern history, and that Javier Milei is truly a force of nature, combining the rigor of an economist with the passion of a revolutionary in the fight for freedom of a nation he loves. Argentina is one of my favorite countries, so I sincerely hope he succeeds. This interview was conducted with the President speaking Spanish and me speaking English with an interpreter simultaneously translating. We make the episode available overdubbed and subtitled in both English and Spanish, thanks to our great friends at ElevenLabs. If you're watching on YouTube, you can switch between English and Spanish by clicking the gear icon, selecting audio track, and then choosing the language. Same with the captions. If you're watching on X, I'll post both Spanish and English versions separately. If you're watching on Spotify or listening elsewhere, I'll probably only post the English version. This is a first time for me doing something like this in a foreign language. It was challenging, but illuminating. I hope to talking to many world leaders for two to three hours in this way, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, and Xi Jinping. I want to explore who they are, how they think, and how they hope to help their country and humanity flourish. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Javier Milei. When did you first understand the value of freedom, especially economic freedom?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was truly eye-opening, or let's say, for reading Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, these were things that really challenged all of my former thinking. I had a vague idea and poor about the Austrian School. The only thing I had read about the Austrian School until then had been Money and Time, a very good book by Garrison. But now that I understand a little bit more about Austrian economics, I know that it was rather poor. This doesn't mean that the book isn't good, but there were a whole lot of things to read that ended up being truly fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So from that, what is now, today, and maybe you can talk about the evolution, is your philosophy, economics philosophy. You've described yourself as an anarcho-capitalist, market anarchists, libertarian. That's the ideal, and then maybe in practice and reality, you've said that you're more of a minarchist. So lay it all out. What's your economics philosophy today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if he was truly such an agonist, he should have been willing to endure going to jail. However, when it was time to face the consequences of the idea he was promoting, he froze, wet his pants and ended up, let's say, accepting all the restrictions because clearly it was better to be out of jail than in jail. But in doing so, he sold out his ideas. So it seems to me that no, not taking into account the restrictions of the situation, only serves to be functional to socialism because all it does is strike against one's own.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you became president 11 months ago. Can you, again, describe some of the actions you took? For example, you cut half the number of government ministries, layoffs, removed price controls. It'll be interesting to lay out the first steps and what's next.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>What's more? Now we are finishing with the open, simultaneous and mandatory primaries because it was a mechanism by which politics was also stealing. We are eliminating the financing of political parties. If you look, we have reduced the fiscal pressure by 15 points to the Argentinians. We are restoring freedoms with a deep set of structural and regulatory reforms that is I think that any sensible liberal could perceive. We are already delivering a wonderful government. In fact, it's the best government in the history of Argentina. If the best had been that of Menem, we've already outpaced him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe you can explain to me the metrics of poverty and unemployment. As you said, unemployment went down, real unemployment went down, real poverty went down. But even that aside, what have been the most painful impacts of these radical reforms and how many of them are required in the short term to have a big positive impact in the long term?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we have reduced the country risk from 3000 basis points to 770. Today, Fitch raised Argentina's rating to CCC. So what do I mean? That translates into a lower country risk and interest rates. And that generates an increase in investment, also generates an increase in consumption. In other words, the Argentinian economy is currently in an absolutely flourishing moment. And how is that sustained in the long term? With structural reforms which we implement daily, deregulating the economy and introducing new laws that free Argentinians from the many oppressive measures that have burdened it over the past 100 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've spoken about the caste, the corrupt political establishment. So there's a lot of powerful people and groups that are against your ideas. What does it take to fight when so much power is against you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>read is a lie. That is to say the fundamental characteristic of most journalists, not all, but the vast majority of journalists in Argentina with some honorable exceptions, is that they are liars, slanderers, and defamers. And if the monopoly they demand were still in place that they want to reign again, I have no doubt that they will demand money in exchange for silence, because that's what they are. They are extortionists, they are thieves, they are corrupt. And then of course, obviously when you take away a privilege from a sector, they get upset. Well, welcome to freedom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're not only fighting for economic freedom, you're fighting for freedom of speech?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some point it collapsed. Why did it collapse? Because they hadn't fought the cultural battle. Then socialism, little by little, took control of institutions in education and the media. So, they took over the media and culture and on that basis, they attacked and broke up the system. And then they found themselves with increasing doses of socialism and the only thing socialism generates is poverty. Therefore, what you must keep in mind is that you have to fight the battles on all fronts. And if you don't keep that in mind, I can tell you are headed towards collapse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like you said, in this fight against corruption, you are challenging some very powerful people, a powerful establishment. Are you ever afraid for your life? Potential assassinations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a cause that I'm going to die with my boots on. I mean I'm not going to make do with living any other way other than with freedom. I will fight everything. I'm going to fight as much as it takes. At least that's the way I feel. So, what good is it to be alive if you're confined? What good is it to be alive if you're not free? It's no good. What good was it for Peter Fetcher to be alive in communist Germany? Well, at least he had a moment of happiness while he tried to escape.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another guy who fights for freedom, freedom of speech in this case, is your new friend, Elon Musk. What do you admire and what have you learned from your interactions with Elon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going to try and replicate the model we are implementing in Argentina. And also, Donald Trump himself is very enthusiastic about this and anything in the way of reducing regulations and cutting public spending and taking government out of the equation means more freedom for the people. So, I'm very pleased with what's going on. And with Trump's victory, because the United States will be better off, Argentina is going to be better too and the whole world is going to be better off. Today, the world is a much better place than it was just a few days ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like you said, Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading the DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency. So from your experience this year as president of Argentina and every chainsaw economic policies that you've implemented, what advice would you give to Elon and Vivek about how to do it in the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that hinder the economic system and progress. And every day, he removes between one and five economic restrictions. So, my advice would be for them to go all the way, to push it to the very limit, and do not give up. Do not let down their guard. Furthermore, that agenda does not have political purpose because at the end of the day, you are removing privileges. Of course, there will be people complaining, but those are people who are losing privileges, so they will have to explain society why they are keeping those privileges, and that is quite uncomfortable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've spoken with Donald Trump, allegedly he called you his favorite president. What did you discuss? And maybe, again, what do you admire about President Trump and what do you learn from him?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>today. I've taken hundreds of selfies. I mean it's truly been... I would say it's been my break, let me say, after almost a year in office and having to face all sorts of media torture because the journalists who have vested interests and are corrupt are professional torturers. Yes, because they invade your personal life, your family, and your privacy. Let me tell you something to show you the kind of garbage the media in Argentina can do. They send three drones to spy on me at my presidential residence, to spy on me. Do you think that's right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>has kept fighting in the face of adversity, even against all odds. And still he managed to win. Amazing. And that's why I can relate that much. And I've also seen how he's been unfairly criticized, like when he was accused of protectionism or when he wanted to discuss some matters within the context of public debate regarding the design of monetary policy as regards to Fed. And basically, they have accused him of things. I mean isn't he entitled to give an opinion as a president? I mean any citizen could give their opinion, even more so a president.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why is it important to you that Argentina has a close relationship with the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is to say it seemed that from that time, 500 years before Christ until today, that struggle continues, right? But well, so of course we're all in. We are betting on the United States becoming, once again a leader in the West. We needed someone to come back to make America great again. And as part of that process, being a commercial ally is also a great idea. So, we would really like to move forward and deepen our trade ties and our investment ties. And well, we would also like to be part of the NATO as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's still possible... One of the radical ideas you had as you were running for president was to dollarize the Argentine economy. Do you think that's still a good idea? Are you still thinking about that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you were to give me the money right now, I would go ahead and dollarize. I'd have no problem with that. For example, I did have a proposal for this, and this could have worked, because the largest creditor of the Argentine treasury is the central bank, but central bank bonds were trading at 20 cents. If I had sold those bonds at 20 cents and nowadays they are trading between 60 and 70. With the whole bunch of Neanderthals that are the opposition, who besides being ignorant in economics, also have bad intentions, I would be in jail today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you a very important, difficult question. I'm a huge fan, have been my whole life, of Diego Maradona and Messi. So who, to you, is the greatest football player of all time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time, of course. Nowadays, he's an older player, right? He is an older player, right? And I'm not sure whether he can still keep that performance on all fronts, but honestly, I have never in my life seen a player like Messi. I have never seen no one like him, for real. Considering the goal average in the days of Pele compared to Messi's golden era and his career now, the number of equivalent goals is much greater than that of Pele, therefore, without a doubt, Messi is the greatest soccer player of all time. No one compares to him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's not just the numbers or the World Cup win, it's the moments of genius on the field. Messi is unlike any other in that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Messi does things that seem technically impossible, they seem physically impossible. The moves he makes don't respect human logic. It's like watching Usain Bolt run. It doesn't feel possible. He moves in a way that doesn't respect human logic, am I right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you watch the 1986 World Cup with Maradona, with the hand of God, with the game against England? What was that like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I say this only as an admirer. Some human beings have the ability to vibrate so close to God that you can't describe it, you can only enjoy it. This is why, in Judaism, they don't use the name of God, of the Creator, because how could you put in words something like that? And I believe those are times when us humans connect closer to the Creator and create unique things, you cannot describe them. There are no words to describe that. The only thing you can do is enjoy it and be thankful that you can witness it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You were a great footballer yourself in your youth. You were a goalkeeper. Many people would say that's the toughest and the most important position in football. Maybe you could speak about that experience and, in general, what's harder; being a goalkeeper or president?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are on your own. And not just that, but also when you have a responsibility, like that of a president, when you make a decision, it has an impact on millions of people. So just like goalkeepers, if you make a mistake and score an own goal, and in this context it's negative consequences for millions of people. Therefore, that has been part of the university of life that has given me the tools to be president today. That is my training in economics, my training in liberalism, having been a goalkeeper, and also having had a very tough childhood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it? What's been the personal toll of carrying the hope of a nation on your shoulders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>being defamed, insulted, and attacked every single day, but again, there's no point in life if it's not with freedom. So, like Sylvester Stallone once said, \"The secret to life is to carry on in spite of the blows you get, the punches you take.\" And fortunately, we have been able to carry on in spite of the blows, both coming at us from in front and from behind our backs, because it have been more honest if we had been attacked directly. But well, in Argentina politics and the mass media, they do love to attack behind your back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What role has God played in your life? And who is God?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, faith, I'd say, has been a very fundamental element. And especially in recent times, during which I've become actively involved, particularly in the teachings of Judaism and in the study of the Torah. This has given me, let's say, a huge background to face the many adversities which I've encountered and had to overcome in the last few years. And as to who God is, He's the Creator, the Maker. I call Him, The One.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is a better guide for humanity; the invisible hand of the market or the hand of God?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're perfectly in sync.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well enough. Again, going back to your youth, you were a lead singer in a rock band. Who's the greatest rock star of all time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay. Well, the way I see it, the most amazing rock singer in history of mankind was definitely Elvis Presley. And my favorite band is the Rolling Stones. So I also greatly admire Mick Jagger, and I still have this dream of getting to meet him in person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How fun would it be to play together with the Stones?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would be a big, big dream. Don't get my hopes up, because I set goals and then I go and achieve them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I'm close friends with a band that opens for the Stones, so I would love to see this happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh, well, that would be great. Or we could also watch the whole concert from the stage. I can't keep ruining the Rolling Stones' music. I already had a tribute band and did quite a lot of damage to their music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much does your rock star roots define your approach to politics, to life? Do you see yourself as a showman in part?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Of course. Absolutely. My idea is that, when you attend one of our events, it feels like going to a Rolling Stones concert. In fact, in one of my most recent performances at Luna Park, I even had the pleasure of singing in front of 10,000 people. It's on YouTube. No, sorry, not on YouTube, it's on my Instagram feed. At that event, I sang a song called Panic Show, and the song starts by saying, \"Hi, everybody. I am the lion.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your intensity and passion have earned you the nickname El Loco, the madman. Do you think some madness is necessary to challenge the powerful establishment?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you the case of San Martin, when he said he was going to cross the Andes to liberate not only Argentina, not only our country, but also Chile and Peru, and people called him crazy. Imagine if you had tried and spoken with, I don't know, Michelangelo, you would have called him crazy too. Or if you had talked to, I don't know, hundreds of people who have changed the world, surely they would have thought that Einstein was crazy and so on, the list would be infinite. So, what is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about the market. It's so interesting, from your view of the world, how powerful the market is at figuring out what's best for society. Why do you think the market works so well as a guide for humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what problem he could fix for humanity. That's amazing. Of course, what is the counterpart? Being successful. Therefore, in that sense, and moreover in my view on how the system works, on how the market works, market failures do not exist. That is to say, that is a problem. A problem for neoclassical economies because of the mathematical tools they've used to develop economic analysis. But actually, it's not a real issue in everyday life, it's a problem in the minds of economists. In fact, my latest book called Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap deals precisely with this issue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you've outlined these ideas in Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap. So the trap is that there's no such thing as a middle ground. It's either capitalism, socialism, and every middle ground ends up in a state of socialism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>failures. And a few days ago, he conducted a survey of search algorithms and policy recommendations, and that resulted in a map painted from red to blue. And well, the redder it was, the more it was linked to socialism, there was an intermediate thing that was yellow, and blue was free market ideas. And one of the things he discovered, as part of that graph or chart, was that the largest number of policy recommendations, scandalously, are actually left-leaning. So that is the empirical evidence of what I pointed out in the book, Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned your four-legged children.

And if there's one thing that defines me is loyalty, being decent. And those virtues, you can find them in those wonderful beings that dogs are, who love unconditionally. In fact, they are superior beings, spiritually speaking in my case, because I don't forget or forgive those who have harmed me. That is to say, all those who have insulted, defamed me, and criticized me, I remember each one of them, but I don't have the greatness needed to forgive them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the topic of loyalty in politics, I'm sure there's been a lot of people, some people, who have betrayed you.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But some people, you actually don't expect anything from them, so if there's betrayal, you won't be annoyed or feel bad, because you owe it to someone who didn't share your values. But politics does have that. Sometimes, many of the people you may come across don't have the values you advocate for, but it's cost benefit. You need to let the ship sail on. Or would you rather let it sink? That's not my case. I fight until the end. There are traitors, but that's part of politics. And that's not my line, but of course, they do exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There are a lot of people who admire your revolutionary spirit.

I'm a perfectionist, so when I do err, of course, I have a bad time. But still, I prefer to go and get things done. If it goes wrong, it's part of life, but I will never have to regret not having done what I thought needed to be done at that moment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gives you hope about the future of Argentina and the future of humanity?<|eot_id|>"}

The second one has to do with a quote from the book of Maccabees 3:19, which says that \"victory in battle doesn't depend on the size of the army, but on the forces of heaven.\" This has to do with the victory of the Jewish people, the Maccabeans, against the Greeks and how they recovered the temple.
