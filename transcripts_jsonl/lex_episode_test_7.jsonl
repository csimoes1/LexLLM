{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So what is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Javier Milei, the president of Argentina. He is a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, and economist, who campaigned with a chainsaw that symbolized his promise to slash the corrupt bureaucracy of the state. He stepped into the presidency one year ago, with a country on the brink of hyperinflation, deepened debt and suffering from mass unemployment and poverty. He took this crisis head on, transforming one of Latin America's largest economies through pure free market principles. In just a few months in office, he already achieved Argentina's first fiscal surplus in 16 years, and not just avoided the hyperinflation but brought inflation down to its lowest in three years. We discuss all of this in detail, both the successes and the challenges. His depth of knowledge of economic principles, metrics and data was truly impressive and refreshing to hear from a world leader. But even bigger than the economic transformation of Argentina, Javier represents the universal fight against government corruption and the fight for freedom, economic freedom, political freedom, and freedom of speech. He has many critics, many of whom a part of the corrupt establishment he's seeking to dismantle, but many are simply Argentinian citizens, scared of the pain his radical policies may bring, at least in the short term. But whether one disagrees with his methods or not, no one can deny that his presidency marks one of the most ambitious attempts at economic transformation in modern history, and that Javier Milei is truly a force of nature, combining the rigor of an economist with the passion of a revolutionary in the fight for freedom of a nation he loves. Argentina is one of my favorite countries, so I sincerely hope he succeeds. This interview was conducted with the President speaking Spanish and me speaking English with an interpreter simultaneously translating. We make the episode available overdubbed and subtitled in both English and Spanish, thanks to our great friends at ElevenLabs. If you're watching on YouTube, you can switch between English and Spanish by clicking the gear icon, selecting audio track, and then choosing the language. Same with the captions. If you're watching on X, I'll post both Spanish and English versions separately. If you're watching on Spotify or listening elsewhere, I'll probably only post the English version. This is a first time for me doing something like this in a foreign language. It was challenging, but illuminating. I hope to talking to many world leaders for two to three hours in this way, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, and Xi Jinping. I want to explore who they are, how they think, and how they hope to help their country and humanity flourish. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

When did you first understand the value of freedom, especially economic freedom?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>poor. This doesn't mean that the book isn't good, but there were a whole lot of things to read that ended up being truly fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So from that, what is now, today, and maybe you can talk about the evolution, is your philosophy, economics philosophy. You've described yourself as an anarcho-capitalist, market anarchists, libertarian. That's the ideal, and then maybe in practice and reality, you've said that you're more of a minarchist. So lay it all out. What's your economics philosophy today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not taking into account the restrictions of the situation, only serves to be functional to socialism because all it does is strike against one's own.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you became president 11 months ago. Can you, again, describe some of the actions you took? For example, you cut half the number of government ministries, layoffs, removed price controls. It'll be interesting to lay out the first steps and what's next.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wonderful government. In fact, it's the best government in the history of Argentina. If the best had been that of Menem, we've already outpaced him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe you can explain to me the metrics of poverty and unemployment. As you said, unemployment went down, real unemployment went down, real poverty went down. But even that aside, what have been the most painful impacts of these radical reforms and how many of them are required in the short term to have a big positive impact in the long term?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>daily, deregulating the economy and introducing new laws that free Argentinians from the many oppressive measures that have burdened it over the past 100 years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've spoken about the caste, the corrupt political establishment. So there's a lot of powerful people and groups that are against your ideas. What does it take to fight when so much power is against you?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thieves, they are corrupt. And then of course, obviously when you take away a privilege from a sector, they get upset. Well, welcome to freedom.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're not only fighting for economic freedom, you're fighting for freedom of speech?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you have to fight the battles on all fronts. And if you don't keep that in mind, I can tell you are headed towards collapse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like you said, in this fight against corruption, you are challenging some very powerful people, a powerful establishment. Are you ever afraid for your life? Potential assassinations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was it for Peter Fetcher to be alive in communist Germany? Well, at least he had a moment of happiness while he tried to escape.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another guy who fights for freedom, freedom of speech in this case, is your new friend, Elon Musk. What do you admire and what have you learned from your interactions with Elon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the whole world is going to be better off. Today, the world is a much better place than it was just a few days ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like you said, Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading the DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency. So from your experience this year as president of Argentina and every chainsaw economic policies that you've implemented, what advice would you give to Elon and Vivek about how to do it in the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those are people who are losing privileges, so they will have to explain society why they are keeping those privileges, and that is quite uncomfortable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've spoken with Donald Trump, allegedly he called you his favorite president. What did you discuss? And maybe, again, what do you admire about President Trump and what do you learn from him?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in Argentina can do. They send three drones to spy on me at my presidential residence, to spy on me. Do you think that's right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean isn't he entitled to give an opinion as a president? I mean any citizen could give their opinion, even more so a president.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why is it important to you that Argentina has a close relationship with the United States?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>move forward and deepen our trade ties and our investment ties. And well, we would also like to be part of the NATO as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think it's still possible... One of the radical ideas you had as you were running for president was to dollarize the Argentine economy. Do you think that's still a good idea? Are you still thinking about that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the whole bunch of Neanderthals that are the opposition, who besides being ignorant in economics, also have bad intentions, I would be in jail today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you a very important, difficult question. I'm a huge fan, have been my whole life, of Diego Maradona and Messi. So who, to you, is the greatest football player of all time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is much greater than that of Pele, therefore, without a doubt, Messi is the greatest soccer player of all time. No one compares to him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's not just the numbers or the World Cup win, it's the moments of genius on the field. Messi is unlike any other in that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>human logic. It's like watching Usain Bolt run. It doesn't feel possible. He moves in a way that doesn't respect human logic, am I right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you watch the 1986 World Cup with Maradona, with the hand of God, with the game against England? What was that like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them. There are no words to describe that. The only thing you can do is enjoy it and be thankful that you can witness it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You were a great footballer yourself in your youth. You were a goalkeeper. Many people would say that's the toughest and the most important position in football. Maybe you could speak about that experience and, in general, what's harder; being a goalkeeper or president?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be president today. That is my training in economics, my training in liberalism, having been a goalkeeper, and also having had a very tough childhood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it? What's been the personal toll of carrying the hope of a nation on your shoulders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more honest if we had been attacked directly. But well, in Argentina politics and the mass media, they do love to attack behind your back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What role has God played in your life? And who is God?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and had to overcome in the last few years. And as to who God is, He's the Creator, the Maker. I call Him, The One.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is a better guide for humanity; the invisible hand of the market or the hand of God?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're perfectly in sync.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well enough. Again, going back to your youth, you were a lead singer in a rock band. Who's the greatest rock star of all time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>band is the Rolling Stones. So I also greatly admire Mick Jagger, and I still have this dream of getting to meet him in person.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How fun would it be to play together with the Stones?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would be a big, big dream. Don't get my hopes up, because I set goals and then I go and achieve them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I'm close friends with a band that opens for the Stones, so I would love to see this happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>stage. I can't keep ruining the Rolling Stones' music. I already had a tribute band and did quite a lot of damage to their music.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much does your rock star roots define your approach to politics, to life? Do you see yourself as a showman in part?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>my Instagram feed. At that event, I sang a song called Panic Show, and the song starts by saying, \"Hi, everybody. I am the lion.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your intensity and passion have earned you the nickname El Loco, the madman. Do you think some madness is necessary to challenge the powerful establishment?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>thought that Einstein was crazy and so on, the list would be infinite. So, what is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about the market. It's so interesting, from your view of the world, how powerful the market is at figuring out what's best for society. Why do you think the market works so well as a guide for humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's a problem in the minds of economists. In fact, my latest book called Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap deals precisely with this issue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you've outlined these ideas in Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap. So the trap is that there's no such thing as a middle ground. It's either capitalism, socialism, and every middle ground ends up in a state of socialism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>recommendations, scandalously, are actually left-leaning. So that is the empirical evidence of what I pointed out in the book, Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mentioned your four-legged children. What have you learned about life from your dogs?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those who have insulted, defamed me, and criticized me, I remember each one of them, but I don't have the greatness needed to forgive them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the topic of loyalty in politics, I'm sure there's been a lot of people, some people, who have betrayed you. Does that hurt your heart?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>case. I fight until the end. There are traitors, but that's part of politics. And that's not my line, but of course, they do exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There are a lot of people who admire your revolutionary spirit.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wrong, it's part of life, but I will never have to regret not having done what I thought needed to be done at that moment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What gives you hope about the future of Argentina and the future of humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
