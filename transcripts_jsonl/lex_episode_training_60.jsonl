I thought you were going to finish it. It's one of the greatest themes in all of film history.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I was just thinking about the Roman Empire, as one does.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Is that whole meme where all guys are thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And half the population is confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously, thinking about the wars going on in the world today, and as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of Roman society and culture, and I think has been a big part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, they usually came as a result of conquest. I mean, there's some like the Hapsburg Empire where there was just a lot of clever marriages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But fundamentally there's an engine of conquest and they celebrate excellence in warfare, many of the leaders were excellent generals, that kind of thing. So a big picture question, Grok approved, I asked if this is a good question to ask.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Tested, Grok approved. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At least on fun mode. To what degree do you think war is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured? I ask this as you have somehow controversially been a proponent of peace.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to be countered. That's the real hard part, not fighting other humans, but all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is... People think of nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing, but in fact it is not. There's some quite funny Werner Herzog thing where he is in the jungle saying that it's basically just murder and death in every direction. The plants and animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other every single day, every minute. So it's not like we're unusual in that respect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there's a relevant question here, whether with greater intelligence comes greater control over these base instincts for violence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. We have much more vulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence than say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks at say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society is filled with violence and it's quite horrific, frankly. That's our limbic system in action. You don't want to be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee, it'll eat your face off and tear your nuts off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Basically there's no limits or ethics or they almost had just war. There's no just war in the chimpanzee societies. Is war and dominance by any means necessary?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Chimpanzee society is a permanent version of human society. They're not like peace loving basically at all. There's extreme violence and then once in a while, somebody who's watched too many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, and then that eats their face or they're nuts off or chew their fingers off and that kind of thing. It's happened several times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's happened to people. It's unfortunate. That's, I guess, one way to ensure that the other chimp doesn't contribute to the gene pool.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, from a martial arts perspective is the fascinating strategy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The nut rougher.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder which of the martial arts teaches that one.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's safe to say if somebody's got your nuts in their hands and as the option of roughing them off, you'll be amenable to whatever they want.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Safe to say. So, like I said, somehow controversially, you've been a proponent of peace on Twitter on X.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the longterm in that part of the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think that part of the world is definitely, if you look up... There is no easy answer in the dictionary. It'll be the picture of the Middle East in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. This is strictly my opinion is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously did not expect to have a military victory, but they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel, and then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, everything, that is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of Hamas.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some sense, the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not exactly turn the other cheek because I do think that it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and either kill them or incarcerate them. That's something has to be done because they're just going to keep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that there's food, water, medical necessities and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So [inaudible 00:07:22] can claim it's a trick. Just put webcam on the thing or 24, 7.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Deploy acts of kindness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, conspicuous acts of kindness that are unequivocal, meaning they can't be somehow because Hamas will then their response will be, \"Oh, it's a trick.\" Therefore, you have to counter how it's not a trick.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. And I'm not sure who said it, it's an [inaudible 00:07:54] saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now, that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing. But you really have... If you're not going to just outright commit genocide against an entire people, which obviously would not be acceptable to really, shouldn't be acceptable to anyone, then you're going to leave basically a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel. So really the question is like for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the real situation there. And it's safe to say that if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few homeless members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That's the situation. But I mean, this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term piece, one has to look at this from the standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me just linger on war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, war, safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Always will exist.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Always has existed and always will exist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I hope not. You think it'll always-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There will always be war. There's a question of just how much war and there's sort of the scope and scale of war. But to imagine that there would not be any war in the future, I think would be a very unlikely outcome.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You talked about the Culture series. There's war even there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. It's a giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die trillions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it still nevertheless protects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I guess if we are able to one day expand to fool the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, the scale of war has been increasing, increasing, increasing. It's like a race between the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A lot of people seem to be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this, the people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>One of the things that does concern me is that there are very few people alive today who actually viscerally understand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are people on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in the West understand it? My grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there I think for almost six years in Eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were killed in front of him, and he would've died too, except they randomly gave some, I guess IQ test or something, and he scored very high. He was not an officer. He was I think a corporal or a sergeant or something like that because he didn't finish high school because he had to drop out of high school because his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the offset corps. So he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category basically. But then randomly they gave him this test. He was transferred to British intelligence in London. That's where we met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next level, next level. I mean, just didn't talk, just didn't talk. And if you tried talking to him, he'd just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals, never bragged about it once, not even hinted nothing. I found out about it because his military records were online. That's how I know. So he would say like, \"No way in hell do you want to do that again.\" But how many people... Obviously, he died, he 20 years ago or longer, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive that remember World War II? Not many.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the same perhaps applies to the threat of nuclear war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean, there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States to make the radioactive revel balance many times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's two major wars going on right now. So you talked about the threat of AGI quite a bit, but now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do you worry about nuclear war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we shouldn't discount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now, I could be wrong, but I think the current probability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us, and we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They're still there. Nobody's put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And the leaders don't seem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, there are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars which are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously, global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently, but certainly to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress to the Stone Age or something. I don't know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and engineers want to be super popular after that as well. You got us into this mess. So generally, I think we obviously want to prioritize civilizational risks over things that are painful and tragic on a local level, but not civilizational.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you hope the war in Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again to minimizing human suffering there?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think that what is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close to the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truce happens. But you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever's on the defense because you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields, trenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority because the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. They're far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death traps, just slow moving, and they're not immune to anti-tank weapons. So you really just have long range artillery and infantry ranges. It's World War I all over again with drones, thrown old drones, some drones there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better, and so more efficient at murdering people on both sides.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So whoever is... You don't want to be trying to advance from either side because the probability of dying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth, trenches and minefields, you really need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms where you do a fast attack with aircraft, a concentrated number of tanks, and a lot of people, that's the only way you're going to punch through a line and then you're going to punch through and then not have reinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That's rough. I mean, the sheer number of people that died there was mind-boggling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's almost impossible to imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost exactly like the beginning in terms of what land belongs to who and so on. But on the other side of a lot of human suffering, death and destruction of infrastructure.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. The thing that... The reason I proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I've predicted pretty much exactly what would happen, which is a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land and the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some sympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, because Russian boys, because boys didn't ask to be on their frontline. They have to be. So there's a lot of sons not coming back to their parents, and I think most of them don't hate the other side. It's sort of like as this saying comes from World War I, it's like young boys who don't know each other killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other. The hell's the point of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in talking to Putin directly. Do you think he should sit down man to man, lead a leader, and negotiate peace?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches, whether he talks to Putin or not, just don't do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not look kindly upon them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You've spoken honestly about the possibility of war between US and China in the longterm if no diplomatic solution is found, for example, on the question of Taiwan and One China policy, how do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, it's worth reading that book on the, difficult to pronounce, the Thucydides Trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like inside out and backwards. There's hardly a battle I haven't read about. And trying to figure out what really was the cause of victory in any particular case as opposed to what one side or another claim the reason.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Both the victory and what sparked the war and-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The whole thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So that Athens and Sparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. There are lots of interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn't write down, so we don't know what happened or they didn't really write in detail. They just would say, \"We had a battle and we won.\" And what? Can you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really wrote a lot. They were very articulate on... They just love writing. And we have a bunch of that writing as preserved. So we know what led up to the Peloponnesian War between the Spartanand Athenian Alliance, and we know that they saw it coming. Spartans didn't write... They also weren't very verbose by their nature, but they did write, but they weren't very verbose. They were [inaudible 00:21:23]. But the Athenians and the other Greeks wrote a line, and Spartan was really kind of like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone's like, \"Well, that's inevitable that there's going to be a clash between Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that?\" And actually they saw it coming and they still could not avoid it. So at some point, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another sort of like the United States has been the biggest kid on the block since I think around 1890 from an economic standpoint. So the United States has been the most powerful economic engine in the world longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy is likely to be two, perhaps three times larger than that of the US. So imagine you're the biggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember, and suddenly a kid comes along who's twice your size.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we see it coming, how is it possible to stop? Let me throw something out there, just intermixing of cultures understanding there does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study because you are an American, obviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture here in the United States, but you also work with China.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe a good question to ask is, what are some things about China that people don't understand, positive just in the culture? What's some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really say how many smart, hardworking people are there in China? There's far more of them there than there are here, I think, in my opinion. And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it's really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible history, very long history, and I think arguably in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint, one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language, and then China, people did write things down. So now China historically has always been, with rare exception, been internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They've fought each other. There've been many, many civil wars. In the Three Kingdoms war, I believe they lost about 70% of their population. So they've had brutal internal wars, civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of China as a sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case. From what I've seen and I think most people who understand China would agree, people in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of their consideration is internal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking about the collaboration and the future piece between superpowers when you're inward facing, which is focusing on improving yourself versus focusing on quote, unquote improving others through military might.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not inquisitive, meaning they're not going to go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly... So that's good. I mean, because a lot of very powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is also one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. After World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country, we've got nukes, nobody else has got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything and it didn't. And the United States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented. The US did conspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin Airlift. And I think it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course America's done bad things, but one needs to look at the whole track record and just generally, one sort of test would be how do you treat your prisoners at war? Or let's say, no offense to the Russians, but let's say you're in Germany, it's 1945, you've got the Russian Army coming one side and you've got the French, British and American Army's coming the other side, who would you like to be just surrendered to? No country is [inaudible 00:27:58] perfect, but I recommend being a POW with the Americans. That would be my choice very strongly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the full menu of POWs in the US.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, a smart guy, was like, \"We've got to be captured by the Americans.\" And in fact, the SS was under orders to execute von Braun and all of the German rocket conditioners, and they narrowly escaped. They said they were going out for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle of winter with no coats and then ran, but no food, no coats, no water, and just ran like hell and ran West and Vice Sherlock, I think his brother found a bicycle or something and then just cycled West as fast as he couldn't have found a US patrol. So anyway, that's one way you can tell morality is where do you want to be a PW? It's not fun anywhere, but some places are much worse than others. Anyway, so America has been, while far from perfect, generally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better, but anyone with half a brain knows that. So I think there are... In this way, China and the United States are similar. Neither country has been acquisitive in a significant way. So that's a shared principle, I guess. Now, China does feel very strongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear about that for a long time. From this standpoint, it would be like one of the states is not there like Hawaii or something like that but more significant than Hawaii. And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really there's a fundamental part of China, the island of Formosa, not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is because the US Pacific fleet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And is their economic power grows and is their military power grows, the thing that they're clearly saying is their interest will clearly be materialized.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, China has been very clear that they'll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Something you said about conspicuous acts of kindness as a geopolitical policy, it almost seems naive, but I'd venture to say that this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature, it just seems like conspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved and deescalate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. So after World War I, they made a big mistake. They basically tried to lump all of blame on Germany and saddle Germany with impossible reparations. And really there was quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to put it all in Germany and that laid the seeds for World War II. So a lot of people, were not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>People don't forget.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you kill somebody's father, mother or son, daughter, they're not going to forget it. They'll want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, \"Well, the Treaty of Versi was a huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of crushing the losers, we're actually going to help them with the module plan, and we're going to help rebuild Germany.

It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing that a relatively small team in a relatively short amount of time was able to develop this close to state-of-the-art system. Another incredible thing is there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I guess I'm to blame for that one.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all, I wish everything in life had a fun mode.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is because I've only have had a little bit of time to play with it, but it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, absolutely. Our AI, Grok, is modeled after The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is one of my favorite books, which it's a book on philosophy. It's- My favorite books, it's a book on philosophy, disguises book on humor. And I would say that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don't know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the more we're able to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There is generally a feeling like this AI system has an outward looking, like the way you are sitting with a good friend looking up at the stars, asking pod head like questions about the universe, wondering what it's all about. The curiosity that you talk about. No matter how mundane the question I ask it, there's a sense of cosmic grandeur to the whole thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, we are actually working hard to have engineering math, physics answers that you can count on. So for the other AIs out there, these so-called large language models, I've not found the engineering to be reliable. It unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you're asking important, difficult questions, that's when it tends to be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible? So you can count on the results, trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really tricky.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is tricky. So that's why there's always going to be some amount of error. But do we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you don't want to be confidently wrong, so you're not going to be right every time, but you want to minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once you can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to bull on that to create inventions, like invent new technologies. But if you cannot count on the foundational physics being correct, obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking, imagination land. Magic basically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, as you said, I think one of the big goals of XAI is to understand the universe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, that's how simple three word mission.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we understand about physics, do you think it will make the sexiest discovery of them as we know now, unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics? So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push towards that direction, almost like theoretical physics discoveries?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, nor has surpassed humans because humans have figured out new physics. Physics is just deepening what's inside into how reality works. And then there's engineering which is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics because once you figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things that already existed. But from that you can then build technologies that are really almost limitless in the variety. And it's like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and with current physics, we do at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Our ability to predict things is incredibly good. Degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my hardest class in college by the way. My senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To get an AI system, a large language model be as reliable as quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. You have to test any conclusions against the ground truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a good test actually. If this LLM understands and matches physics, then you can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it's also not the case currently that even that its internal logic is not consistent. So especially with the approach of just predicting a token predict token, predict token, it's like a vector sum. You're summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. A little bit of error adds up and by the time you are many tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it has to be somehow self-aware about the drift.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing as a gestalt as a whole and say it doesn't have coherence as a whole.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think we need to understand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some fundamental questions of what is thought, what is emotion? Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we're probably missing some really big things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Something that'll be obvious in retrospect. You put the whole consciousness and motion.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, some people would quote like a soul religion, be a soul. You feel like you're you, I mean you don't feel like you're just a collection of atoms, but on what dimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? Because we feel them very strongly.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What is consciousness? When you put the atoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions and feelings?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Why does the solution exist? On what plane does the solution exist?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It does seem more fun, yes.

I asked you what question would you ask an AGI system once you create it? And you said, \"What's outside the simulation,\" is the question. Good question.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's one of the foam paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I've seen any evidence of aliens and I haven't, which is kind of concerning. I think I'd probably prefer to at least have seen some archeological evidence of aliens. To the best of my knowledge, I'm not aware of any evidence surveillance. If they're out there, they're very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say the history of Earth, to believe the archeological record Earth is about four and a half billion years old. Civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit there to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore. I think it was an archaic pre-form was the first actual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that's a good date for when we say civilization started. That's 1000000th of Earth's existence. So civilization has been around. It's really a flash in the pan so far. And why did it take so long? Four and a half billion years, for the vast majority of the time, there was no life. And then there was archaic bacteria for a very long time. And then you had mitochondria get captured, multicellular life, differentiation into plants and animals, life moving from the oceans to land, mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly but it'll heat the earth up at some point in the future, boil the oceans and earth will become like Venus, where life as we know it is impossible. So if we do not become multiplanetary and ultimately solar system, annihilation of all life on earth is a certainty. A certainty. And it could be as little as on the galactic timescale, half a billion years, long time by human standards, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around at all. So if life had taken 10% longer to evolve on earth, it wouldn't exist at all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Glad a deadline coming up, you better hurry. But that said, as you said, humans intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool stuff very quickly. So it seems like becoming a multiplanetary is almost inevitable.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We need to do it. I suspect that if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I mean there are various explanations for paradox and one is they're these great vultures which civilizations don't pass through.

And if you don't, it's simply a matter of time before something happens on your planet, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now? They didn't have spaceships.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think the more likely thing is because just to empathize with the aliens that they found us and they're protecting us and letting us be.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So aliens, I mean, I don't know.

Now it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now and then never open again.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's that view that God is like the universe and reveals himself through the laws of physics or as Einstein said, \"Through the lawful harmony of the world.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

Who's running this thing? Embodying it into a singular question with a sexy word on top of it is focusing the mind to understand. It does seem like there's a, again, it could be an illusion.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There may not be a master plan in the sense. So maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher beings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So they don't know what happens otherwise they wouldn't hold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it's SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time. Especially for the rocket, you have to run a lot of simulations to understand what's going to happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space and you want it to work. So you have to simulate subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, ascend, and then coming back, super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has got to be simulated because you don't get very many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations to see what happens, not if we knew what happens, we wouldn't run the simulation. So whoever created this existence, they're running it because they don't know what's going to happen, not because they do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe we both played Diablo.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I can cruise through Tier 100 Nightmare Dungeon like a stroll in the park.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And still you're defeated by Hatred?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I guess maybe the second hardest boss is Duriel. Duriel can even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times and every other boss in the game, all of them kill him so many times, it's easy. But Uber Lilith, otherwise known as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you're Duriel and you have no ability to go to be vulnerable, there are these random death waves that come at you. Really I am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime of playing video games. At one point, I was maybe one of the best quake players in the world. I actually won money in what I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We were doing four person quake tournaments and I was the second best person on the team and the actual best person that... We were actually winning, we would've come first, except the best person on the team. His computer crashed halfway through the game. So we came second, but I got money for it and everything. So basically I got skills, albeit no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank, it's driving me crazy to beat Lilith as a Druid, basically trying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As a Druid.<|eot_id|>"}

I have seen directly, you're actually a world-class, incredible video game player. And I think Diablo, so you're just picking up a new game and you're figuring out its fundamentals. You're also with the Paragon Board and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever they suggest on the internet. You're also an innovator there, which is hilarious to watch.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would not recommend playing a druid in the eternal realm.

The suppression of everyone, it might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified society that never changes.

It's used to treat muscle pain and discomfort, and it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, Soma isn't just a pain reliever, it's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy. So it's not something to take if you're planning on operating, having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations. And it goes on and on.

It seems that training LLMs efficiently is a big focus for xAI. First of all, what's the limit of what's possible in terms of efficiency? There's this terminology of useful productivity per watt. What have you learned from pushing the limits of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I think it's helpful, the tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied I think to really any arena in life. It's really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason with from first principles and think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even at the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness the entire power of the sun, you'll still care about useful compute per watt. That's where I think, probably where things are headed from the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Somebody has a sense of humor in this thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think, yes, fate loves irony, ironic humor, an ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Humor is all you need. I think spice is all you need somebody posted.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But yeah, so we have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer shortage probably in about a year, and then just electricity shortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you really need to prepare for traveling of electricity demand because all transport is going to go electric with the ironic exception of rockets, and heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms, one third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for everything to go sustainable, to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should definitely buy more batteries because the grid currently is sized for realtime load, which is kind of crazy because that means you've got to size for whatever the peak electricity demand is, the worst second or the worst day of the year, or you can have a brown out or blackout. We had that crazy blackout for several days in Austin because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid. If you've got a hydropower plant you can buffer energy, but otherwise it's all real time. So with batteries, you can produce energy at night and use it during the day so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be very heavy usage of batteries in the future because the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, so its lowest point to highest point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So batteries necessary to balance it out, but the demand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And part of that is the compute?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will be much bigger than AI, at least-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the short term.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing demand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a growing demand for electricity to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously, can lead to electricity shortage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How difficult is the problem of, in this particular case, maximizing the useful productivity per watt for training and that's, this seems to be really where the big problem we're facing that needs to be solved, is how to use the power efficiently. What you've learned so far about applying this physics first principle of reasoning in this domain, how difficult is this problem?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It will get solved. It's the question of how long it takes to solve it. So at various points, there's some kind of limiting factor to progress and with regard to AI, I'm saying right now the limiting factor is silicon chips and that will, we're going to then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers because you've got power coming in at 300,000 volts and it's got to step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it's a very big amount of, the voltage step down is gigantic and the industry is not used to rapid growth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. Let's talk about the competition here. You've shown concern about Google and Microsoft with OpenAI developing AGI. How can you help ensure with xAI and Tesla AI work that it doesn't become a competitive race to AGI, but that is a collaborative development of safe AGI?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean I've been pushing for some kind of regulatory oversight for a long time. I've been somewhat of a Cassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we want to be very careful in how we develop AI. It's a great power and with great power comes great responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective third party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the various leading players are doing with AI, and even if there's no enforcement ability, they can at least voice concerns publicly. Jeff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns, but now he's not at Google anymore, so who's going to voice the concerns? So I think there's, Tesla gets a lot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. We're subject to, I think over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. It's a lot. You could fill this room with the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere to for automotive. Same is true for rockets and for, currently, the limiting factor for SpaceX for Starship launch is regulatory approval. The FAA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for fish and wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That's why I posted I want to buy a fish license on, which also refers to the Monte Python sketch. Why do you need a license for your fish? I don't know. But according to the rules, I'm told you need some sort of fish license or something. We effectively need a fish license to launch a rocket. And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? I mean, some of the things I feel like are so absurd that I want to do a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is actually what happened. One of the things that was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about a rocket hitting a shark. And the ocean's very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often. As a percentage of ocean surface area, sharks basically are zero. And so then we said, well, how will we calculate the probability of killing a shark? And they're like, well, we can't give you that information because they're worried about shark fin hunters going and hunting sharks and I said, well, how are we supposed to, we're on the horns of a dilemma then. They said, well, there's another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I'm like, well, why don't you give them the data? We don't trust them. Excuse me? They're literally in your department. Again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? Eventually they managed to solve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability of us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there's another organization that I didn't realize existed until a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a whale in international waters. Now, again, you look the surface, look at the Pacific and say what percentage of the Pacific consists of whale? I could give you a big picture and point out all the whales in this picture. I'm like, I don't see any whales. It's basically 0%, and if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely unlikely beyond all belief, fate had it, that's a whale has some seriously bad luck, least lucky whale ever.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean this is quite absurd, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Well, I mean one of the things that's pretty wild is for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be dismayed by the sonic booms. Now, there've been a lot of rockets launched out of Vandenberg and the seal population has steadily increased. So if anything, rocket booms are an aphrodisiac, based on the evidence, if you were to correlate rocket launches with seal population. Nonetheless, we were forced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put headphones on the seal and play sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I would love to see this. Yeah. Sorry. There's a seal with headphones.<|eot_id|>"}

I think I'm generally in favor of open sourcing, biased towards open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to me that OpenAI, I was I think, I guess oddly the prime mover behind OpenAI in the sense that it was created because of discussions that I had with Larry Page back when he and I were friends and I stayed at his house and I talked to him about AI safety, and Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time he didn't. And at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human, and I'm like, well, what team are you on, Larry? He's still on Team Robot to be clear. And I'm like, okay. So at the time Google had acquired DeepMind, they had probably two thirds of all AI researchers in the world. They had basically infinite money and compute, and the guy in charge, Larry Page, did not care about safety and even yelled at me and caught me a speciesist for being pro-human.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I don't know if you notice about humans, they can change their mind and maybe you and Larry Page can still, can be friends once more.<|eot_id|>"}

And finally he did agree to join OpenAI. That was one of the toughest recruiting battles we've ever had. But that was really the linchpin for OpenAI being successful. And I was also instrumental in recruiting a number of other people, and I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million.

A huge percentage of websites have more noise than signal because they're just used for search engine optimization. They're literally just scam websites.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you, by the way, sorry to interrupt, get the signal, separate the signal and noise on X? That's such a fascinating source of data. No offense to people posting on X, but sometimes there's a little bit of noise.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the signal noise could be greatly improved. Really, all of the posts on the X platform should be AI recommended, meaning we should populate a vector space around any given post, compare that to the vector space around any user and match the two. Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it's mostly heuristics. And if there's a reply where the reply to a post could be much better than the original post, but will, according to the current rules of the system, get almost no attention compared to a primary post.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a lot of that, I got the sense, so a lot of the X algorithm has been open sourced and been written up about, and it seems there to be some machine learning. It's disparate, but there's some machine.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of stuff on the system, but I think, right now it's not currently good at recommending things from accounts you don't follow or where there's more than one degree of separation. So it is pretty good if there's at least some commonality between someone you follow liked something or reposted it or commented on it or something like that. But if there's no, let's say somebody posts something really interesting, but you have no followers in common, you would not see it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting. And then as you said, replies might not surface either.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Replies basically never get seen currently. I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's incorrect. Replies have a couple order magnitude less importance than primary posts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think this can be more and more converted into end to end mural net?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Yeah, that's what it should be. Well, the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. There's a series of vectors basically parameters, vectors, whatever you want to call them, but sort of things that the system knows that you like. Maybe there's several hundred vectors associated with each user account and then any post in the system, whether it's video, audio, short post, long post. The reason by the way I want to move away from tweet is that people are posting two, three hour videos on the site. That's not a tweet. It'd be like tweet for two hours? Come on. Tweet made sense when it was 140 characters of text. Because it's like a bunch of little birds tweeting. But when you've got long form content, it's no longer a tweet. So a movie is not a tweet. Apple, for example, posted the entire episode of The Silo, the entire thing, on a platform. By the way, it was their number one social media thing ever in engagement of anything, on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, Hey, wow, they posted an entire hour long episode of, so no, that's not a tweet. This is a video.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But from a neural net perspective, it becomes really complex, whether it's a single, so everything's data. So single sentence, a clever sort of joke, dad joke is in the same pool as a three hour video.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean right now it's a hodgepodge for that reason. Let's say in the case of Apple posting an entire episode of this series, pretty good series, by the way, The Silo, I watched it. So there's going to be a lot of discussion around it. So you've got a lot of context, people commenting, they like it, they don't like it or they like this, and you can then populate the vector space based on the context of all the comments around it. So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information around it that allows you to populate back to space of that hour long video. And then you can obviously get more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie and tell you if you're going to like the movie.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Convert the movie into language, essentially.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Analyze this movie and just like your movie critic or TV series and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie, just like a friend can tell you, if a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie with high probability that you'll like it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But this is a friend that's analyzing, whatever, hundreds of millions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, actually, frankly, AI will be better than, will know you better than your friends know you, most of your friends anyway.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And as part of this, it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like, I mean, I like advertisements that are well done. The whole point is because it funds things. Like an advertisement that you actually want to see is a big success.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is, if it's for a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it's content. And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, it could be like a Coca-Cola ad. They actually run a lot of great ads on the X system and McDonald's does too. And you can do something that's like, well, this is just a cool thing. And so basically the question is, do you regret seeing it or not? And if you don't regret seeing it's a win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts and maybe number of seconds you linger on a post or something like this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, attention is a big factor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Attention.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So that's why it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is tallying up how many user seconds, users were interested in this thing for how many seconds? So if it's a really short thing, well they will be less. If it's a link leading out of the system, which we're not opposed to at all, it just is going to have fewer user seconds then that article was posted on the X platform.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard is it to go from maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing unregretted minutes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly unregretted minutes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's tricky. It's a tough-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, our goal is to be as even-handed and fair as possible. Whether someone is right, left, independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as fair and as much of a level playing field as possible. And in the past, Twitter has not been, Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So if sometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well, it's moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the right from the far left, but no one on the far left that I'm aware of has been suspended or banned or deamplified. But we're trying to be inclusive for the whole country and for farther countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's great. In fact, no system is going to be perfect, but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so the magic of community notes is... The magic of Community Notes is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. In order to write a note or rate, you have to rate many notes. And so, we actually do use AI here. So, we populate a vector space around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So, it's not as simple as left or right, because there are many more... Life is much more complex than left or right. So, there's a bunch of correlations in how you rate a Community Notes post, Community Notes. So then, in order for a community note to actually be shown, people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's fascinating, because there's a pool of people that have disagreements and somehow they collaborate through that process of disagreement to come up with context... It's fascinating it works.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. It makes sense that if people who in the past have disagreed, agree about something, it's probably true.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I wonder, is there a possible somehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a different kind of thing, which is more permanent articles about things.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Wikipedia is very hierarchical. Whereas, Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. The asset test is I can't change a community note if somebody put a gun to my head. And Community Notes, all the code is open source, 100%. All the data is open source, 100%. So, you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So, if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By The way, on the topic of Grok, it's actually pretty good at criticizing you, which is great.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in San Francisco, a big civil trial, and the jury found me not guilty.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think this is taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. But if I did not agree to pay the fine, Tesla would've gone bankrupt immediately. So, I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend our lines of credit. And if they suspend our lines of credit, at that time, we would've gone bankrupt instantly. So, there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because Tesla would be dead. So really, this is like someone holding a gun to your kid's head and saying, \"Pay $20 million and admit...\" This is like a hostage negotiation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Was that story fully told? I mean, SEC, in its best form, could be a force for good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It should be. But not once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds who were nonstop shorting and distorting Tesla. Not once.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The incentive structure is messed up because the lawyers at the SEC are not paid well, it's a fairly low paying job, but what they're looking for is a trophy from the SEC. They're looking for something they put on, basically, their LinkedIn. From that, they can get a job at a high paying law firm. That's exactly what the lawyer here did. And the reason they don't attack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ those law firms. And they know if they attack the hedge funds, they're affecting their future career prospects.

If there was an SEC investigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we're bankrupted immediately, at the time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>These are public court cases, both the SEC civil case where the civil complaints on the SEC guys lost unanimous jury verdict in San Francisco.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think I will be cynical. In fact, my feeling is that one should be... Never trust a cynic.

It's a red flag if someone's a cynic, a true cynic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a degree of projection there that's always fun to watch from the outside and enjoy the hypocrisy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is an important point that I think people who are listening should bear in mind. If somebody is cynical, meaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse their own bad behavior by saying that, \"Well, everyone does it.\" That's not true. Most people are kind of medium good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I do wish the people on X will be better at seeing the good in other people's behavior.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't know. There's just a strong negative bias in the news.

It was one of the most incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And it was really exciting, and it was super exciting when it generalized, became more than a robot on four wheels, but a real world AI system that perceives the world and can have potentially different embodiments.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean, the really wild thing about the end-to-end training is that it can read science, but we never taught it to read. Yeah. We never taught it what a car was or what a person was, or a cyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are on the road from video, just from watching video, just like humans. I mean, humans are photons in, controls out. The vast majority of information reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, \"Well, what's the output?\" The output is our motor signals to our fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Photons in, controls out. The same is true of the car.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But by looking at the sequence of images...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And in so doing, it's understanding something deep about the world, which is... I don't know, it's beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's how our brain works.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But it's beautiful-<|eot_id|>"}

And so, the question is, how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's excited about LLMs. In the space of self supervised learning in the space of text, it seems like there's a deep similarity between that and what Tesla autopilot is doing. Is it, to you, basically the same, but different-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They are converging.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder who gets there faster, having a deep understanding of the world, or they just will naturally converge?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much more computer efficient, it had to be. Because we were constrained on this... We only have 100 watts and [inaudible 02:06:37] computer. 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is small potatoes these days. [inaudible 02:06:49] eight. But it's understanding the world [inaudible 02:06:51] eight. It's [inaudible 02:06:53].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there, the path to AGI might have much more significant impact because it's understanding... It will faster understand the real world than will LLMs. And therefore, be able to integrate with the humans in the real world faster.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're both going to understand the world, but I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more compute efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Our brain is very compute efficient, very energy efficient. Think of what is our brain able to do. There's only about 10 watts of higher brain function, not counting stuff that's just used to control our body. The thinking part of our brain is less than 10 watts. And those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than a 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So, there's a six order of magnitude difference there. I mean, the AI has thus far gotten to where it is via brute force, just throwing massive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So, this is not where it will end up. In general, with any given technology, you first try to make it work, and then you make it efficient. So I think we'll find, over time, that these models get smaller, are able to produce sensible output with far less compute, far less power. Tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because we've just been forced to try to understand the world with 100 watts of compute. And there are a bunch of fundamental functions that we forgot to include. So, we had to run a bunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of those with hardware four, and then hardware five will be even better. But it does appear, at this point, that the car will be able to drive better than a human, even with hardware three and 100 watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it, it could be probably less than 50 watts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What have you learned about developing Optimus, about applying, integrating this real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny or big things you've understood?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every part of the robot ourselves.

We couldn't actually find a source of electric motors for any amount of money.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not even just efficient and expensive, it's like anything, there's not...<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. We tried hard to find anything that was... Because you think of how many electric motors are made in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of electric motor designs. None of them were suitable for a humanoid robot, literally none. So, we had to develop our own. Design it specifically for what a humanoid robot needs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, it could be relatively and expensive? I mean, if you compare to Boston Dynamics' Atlas, is a very expensive robot.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is designed to be manufactured in the same way they would make a car. And I think, ultimately, we can make Optimus for less than the cost of a car. It should be, because if you look at the mass of the robot, it's much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But the actuators are interesting on a humanoid robot with fingers.

Just by looking, just by looking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Maybe a year. Although, I go back to I'm optimistic on time. The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The perception or also the control?<|eot_id|>"}
