{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with John Mearsheimer, a professor at University of Chicago and one of the most influential and controversial thinkers in the world. He teaches, speaks and writes about the nature of power and war on the global stage, in history and today. Please allow me to say, once again, my hope for this little journey I'm on. I will speak to everyone on all sides with compassion, with empathy, and with backbone. I'll speak with Vladimir Putin and with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with Russians and with Ukrainians, with Israelis and with Palestinians, with everyone. My goal is to do whatever small part I can to decrease the amount of suffering in the world by trying to reveal our common humanity. I believe that in the end, truth and love wins. I will get attacked for being naive, for being a shill, for being weak. I'm none of those things, but I do make mistakes and I will get better. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's John Mearsheimer. Can you explain your view on power in international politics as outlined in your book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics and in your writing since then?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>lot of people and you want to be really wealthy. Of course, this is why the United States is so powerful. It has lots of people and it has lots of wealth. China was not considered a great power until recently because it didn't have a lot of wealth. It certainly had population size, but it didn't have wealth. And without both a large population and much wealth, you're usually not considered a great power. So I think power matters, but when we talk about power, it's important to understand that it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a lot of interesting things there. First you said nations in relation to each other is essentially in a state of anarchism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>beat up on other kids or on other states, but because again, that's the best way to survive. And as I like to point out to people, the best example of what happens when you're weak in international politics is what the Chinese call the century of national humiliation. From the late 1840s to the late 1940s the Chinese were remarkably weak, and the great powers in the system preyed upon them. And that sends a very important message to not only the Chinese, but to other states in the system. Don't be weak, be as powerful as you can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we'll talk about it, but humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to something you've also studied, which is Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We'll talk about it, but staying to the psychology and philosophy picture, what's the connection between the will to power in the individual, as you mentioned, and the will to power in a nation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to power has a lot more to do with an individual in the Nietzschen story where that concept comes from. So it's very important to understand that I'm not arguing that states are inherently aggressive. My point is that as long as states are in anarchy, they have no choice but to behave in an aggressive fashion. But if you went to a hierarchic system, there's no reason for those states to worry about the balance of power, because if they get into trouble there is a higher authority that they can turn to. There is in effect a leviathan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the role of military might in this will to power on the national level?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, military mights is what ultimately matters. As I said to you before, the two building blocks of power are population size and wealth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You didn't mention military mights.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I did not, no. That's right. And it's good that you caught that because if you have a large population and you're a wealthy country, what you do is you build a large military, and it's ultimately the size of your military that matters because militaries fight wars. And if states are concerned about survival, which I argue is the principle goal of every state in the international system for what I think are obvious reasons, then they're going to care about having a powerful military that can protect them if another state comes after them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's not obvious that a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain dominant soul superpower status to military might. But you're saying, as you see the world today, it has to be that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you dominate all of Europe, assuming you're Imperial Germany or Napoleonic France, then no other state in the area or in the region can threaten you because you're simply so powerful. And again, what I'm saying here is that the structure of the international system really matters. It's the fact that you're in this anarchic system where survival is your principle goal and where I can't know your intentions, right? You're another state. I can't know that at some point you might not come after me. You might. And if you're really powerful and I'm not, I'm in deep trouble.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So some of the ideas underlying what you've said, offensive realism, which I would love to talk to you about sort of the history of realism versus liberalism, but some of the ideas you already mentioned, anarchy between states, everybody's trying to develop military capabilities, uncertainty, such an interesting concept. States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them, which is one-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's of enormous importance to the story,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...really important, and so interesting because you also say that this makes realists more cautious and more peaceful, the uncertainty because of all the uncertainty involved here, it's better to approach international politics with caution, which is really interesting to think about. Again, survival, most states interested in survival. And the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational, which-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Most of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Most of the time. You call this framework offensive realism. Can you just give an overview of the history of the realism versus liberalism debate as worldviews?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>each other, then you have a more peaceful world. That was his argument. It's a very liberal argument. A realist like me would say that it doesn't matter whether a state is a democracy or not, all states behave the same way because the structure of the system, getting back to our earlier discussion about international anarchy, the structure of the system leaves those states no choice, whether they're democracies or autocracies. And again, the liberal view, this first liberal theory, is that democracies don't fight other democracies, and therefore the more democracies you have, the more peaceful the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I just sort of try to unpack that a little bit? So the democratic peace theory, I guess, would say that in democracies leaders are elected, and the underlying assumption is most people want peace, and so they will elect peacemakers. So the more democracies you have, the more likely you have peace. And then the realist perspective says that it doesn't matter if the majority of people want peace. The structure of international politics is such that superpowers want to become more super and powerful, and they do that through war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>peace theory, the main argument you have to make is that liberal democracies have a healthy respect for each other and they can assess each other's intentions. If you're a liberal democracy, and I'm a liberal democracy, we know we have value systems that argue against aggression, and argue for peaceful resolution of crises. And therefore, given these norms, we can trust each other, we can know each other's intentions. Remember, for realists like me, uncertainty about intentions really helps drive the train. But if you're talking about two democracies, the argument there is that they know each other's intentions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And for you, sure, maybe democracies reduce uncertainty a little bit, but not enough to stop the train.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interdependence leads to peace. And then the third liberal argument has to do with institutions, sometimes referred to as liberal institutionalism. And this is the argument that if you can get states into institutions where they become rule abiding actors, they will obey the rules that dictate that war is not acceptable. So if you get them to accept the UN rules on when you can and cannot initiate a war, then you'll have a more peaceful world. So those are the liberal theories, and as you can tell, they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you maybe argue against the economic interdependence and in the institutions that institutions follow rules a little bit? So the golden goose with the golden egg, you're saying that nations are happy to kill the goose because again, they want power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>alliances, and you have an intense security competition between them. At the same time, you have a great deal of economic interdependence. It's amazing how much economic intercourse is taking place in Europe among all the actors. And people are getting prosperous or countries are getting prosperous as a result. But nevertheless, in the famous July crisis of 1914, this economic prosperity is unable to prevent World War I because security concerns or survival is more important. So there are going to be lots of situations where prosperity and survival come into conflict, and in those cases, survival will win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And maybe you can speak to the different camps of realists. You said offensive and defensive. Can you draw a distinction between those two?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let me just back up a bit on that one. And you were talking about will to power before. The first big divide between realists is structural realists and human nature realists, and Hans Morgenthau, who was influenced by nature and therefore had that will to power logic embedded in his thinking about how the world works, he was a human nature realist. I'm a structural realist and I believe it's not human nature, it's not individuals in some will to power that drives competition and war. What drives competition and war is the structure of the system. It's anarchy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're not as romantic as the human nature realists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's just a world of difference between the two. It's just important to understand that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So within that, from the structural, there's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>realism, maintaining how much power you have. Not trying to gain more power, because the argument the defense of realists make is that if you try to gain more power, the system will punish you, the structure will punish you. I'm not a defensive realist, I'm an offensive realist. And my argument is that states look for opportunities to gain more power, and every time they see, or almost every time they see an opportunity to gain more power, and they think the likelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great, they'll jump at that opportunity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to linger on the human nature perspective, how do you explain Hitler and Nazi Germany, just one of the more recent aggressive expansions through military might? How do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Napoleon and the other was Hitler. Now, if you want to call that a will to power, you can do that. I'm more comfortable referring to Hitler as a congenital aggressor and referring to Napoleon as a congenital aggressor, although there were important differences between the two, because Hitler was probably the most murderous leader in recorded history, and Napoleon was not in that category at all. But both of them were driven by what you would call a will to power, and that has to be married to the structural argument in Hitler's case, and also in Napoleon's case.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some degree on the human psychology side that resentment, because of what happened after World War I, led to Hitler willing so much power, and then Hitler starting World War II? So this is the human side. Perhaps the reason I asked that question is also because you mentioned the century of humiliation on the China side. So to which degree does humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to World War II?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>30th, 1933, he's in power. And then the question of what is driving him comes racing to the fore. Is there resentment over the Versailles treaty and what happened to Germany? Yes. Did that matter? Yes. But my argument is that structure was the principle factor driving the train in Hitler's case. But what I'm saying here is that there were other factors that as well, resentment being one of them. Will to power or the fact that he was a congenital aggressor in my lexicon certainly mattered as well, so I don't want to dismiss your point about resentment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Hitler in particular, the way he wielded, the way he gained so much power, might have been the general resentment of the populace or the German populace.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>worth noting that he was a remarkably charismatic individual. I find that hard to believe because every time I look at him or listen to his speeches, he does not appear to be charismatic to me. But I've talked to a number of people who are experts on this subject who assure me that he was very charismatic. And I would note to you, if you look at public opinion polls in Germany, West Germany, in the late 1940s, this is the late 1940s after the Third Reich is destroyed in 1945, he is still remarkably popular in the polls.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Stalin is still popular in many parts of Eastern Europe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. And Stalin's popular in many quarters inside Russia, and Stalin murdered more of his own people than he murdered people outside of the Soviet Union.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And still to you, the tides of history turned not on individuals, but on structural considerations. So Hitler may be a surface-layer characteristics of how Germany started war, but not really the reason.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, history is a multidimensional phenomenon-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I hear.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you're talking about someone like Adolf Hitler, why did he start World War II is a very different question than why did he start the Holocaust or why did he push forward a holocaust? I mean, that's a different question, and realism doesn't answer that question. So I want to be very clear that I'm not someone who argues that realism answers every question about international politics, but it does answer what is one of the big, if not the biggest, questions that IR scholars care about, which is what causes security competition and what causes great power war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does offensive realism answer the question why Hitler attacked the Soviet Union?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because from a military strategy perspective, there's pros and cons to that decision.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a quick and decisive victory. And he did, as did his generals. It's very interesting, I've spent a lot of time studying German decision making in World War II. If you look at the German decision to invade Poland on September 1st, 1939, and you look at the German decision to invade France on May 10th, 1940, and then the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, what you see is there was actually quite a bit of resistance to Hitler in 1938 at the time of Czechoslovakia, Munich, and there was also quite a bit of resistance in September, 1939.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Internally? Or you mean...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>especially attractive to lots of German policy makers, including military leaders. And then came France 1940. In the run-up to May 10th, 1940, there was huge resistance in the German army to attacking France. But that was eventually eliminated because they came up with a clever plan, the Manstein Plan. If you look at the decision to invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, which is the only case where they fail... They succeeded in France, they succeeded in Poland, they succeeded at Munich in 1938. Soviet Union is where they fail. There's hardly any resistance at all, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, and to say that they failed the Soviet Union, my grandfather fought for the Soviet Union, there was a lot of successes early on. So there's poor military, I would say, strategic decisions along the way, but it caught Stalin off guard. Maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, terrifyingly so, they could have been successful if certain different decisions were made from a military perspective.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the opposite argument that they were doomed. But I'm not terribly comfortable making that argument. I think the Wehrmacht, by the summer of 1941, was a finely tuned instrument for war, and the Red Army was in quite terrible shape. Stalin had purged the Officer Corps, they had performed poorly in Finland, and there were all sorts of reasons to think that they were no match for the Wehrmacht. And if you look at what happened in the initial stages of the conflict, that proved to be the case. The Germans won a lot of significant tactical victories early on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if they focused and went to Moscow as quickly as possible, again, terrifyingly, so could have been, basically topple Stalin. And one thing that's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's possible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back on the offensive in 1942. This is Operation Blue, and the main Axis in '42 is deep into the Ukraine and into the caucuses, and that fails. But one could argue that, had they done that in '41, had they not gone to Moscow, had they gone, had they concentrated on going deep into Ukraine and into the caucuses, they could have knocked the Soviets out that way. I'm not sure that in the end I believe that. I think in the end the Soviets would've won no matter what, but I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sometimes, maybe you can educate me, but sometimes they say, just like with Napoleon, winter defeated Hitler in Russia. I think not often enough people tell the story of the soldiers and the motivation and how hard they fight. So it turns out that Ukrainians and Russians are not easy to conquer. They're the kinds of people that don't roll over and fight bravely. There seems to be a difference in certain peoples, in how they see war, how they approach war, how proud they are to fight for their country, to die for their country, these kinds of things. So I think Battle of Stalingrad tells, at least to me, a story of extremely brave fighting on the Soviet side, and that, it's a component of war too. It's not just structural, it's not just military strategy, it's also the humans involved, but maybe that's a romantic notion of war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>remember the invasion is June '41, by December of 1941, the Germans have murdered 2 million Soviet POWs. At that point in time, they had murdered many more POWs than they had murdered Jews. And this is not to deny for one second that they were on a murderous rampage when it came to Jews, but they were also on a murderous rampage when it came to Soviet citizens and Soviet soldiers. So those Soviet soldiers quickly came to understand they were fighting for their lives. If they were taken prisoner, they would die. So they fought like wild dogs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the story of the Holocaust, of the 6 million Jews, is often told extensively. If Hitler won, conquered the Soviet Union, it's terrifying to think, on a much grander scale than the Holocaust, what would've happened to the Slavic people, to the Soviet people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and all the Roma. I mean, my view is that the Jews were number one on the genocidal hit list. The Roma, or the gypsies, were number two, and the Poles were number three. And of course, I just explained to you how many POWs they had killed. So they would've ended up murdering huge numbers of Soviet citizens as well. But people quickly figured out that this was happening, that's my point to you. And that gave them, needless to say, very powerful incentives to fight hard against the Germans, and to make sure that they did not win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To fast-forward in time, but not in space, let me ask you about the war in Ukraine. Why did Russia invade Ukraine on February 24th, 2022? What are some of the explanations given? And which do you find the most convincing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, clearly, the conventional wisdom is that Putin is principally responsible. Putin is an imperialist, he's an expansionist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the conventional thinking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. And the idea is that he is bent on creating a greater Russia, and even more, so he's interested in dominating Eastern Europe, if not all of Europe, and that Ukraine was the first stop on the train line. And what he wanted to do was to conquer all of Ukraine, incorporate it into a greater Russia, and then he would move on and conquer other countries. This is the conventional wisdom. My view is there is no evidence, let me emphasize, zero evidence, to support that argument.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which part? That he would... The imperialist part, the sense that he sought to conquer all of Ukraine, and move on and conquer-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>taking place. And of course, the West doesn't want to be principally responsible. It wants to blame Vladimir Putin. So we've invented this story out of whole cloth that he is an aggressor, that he's the second coming of Adolf Hitler, and that what he did in Ukraine was try to conquer all of it and he failed. But with a little bit of luck, he probably would've conquered all of it, and he'd now be in the Baltic States, and eventually end up dominating all of Eastern Europe. As I said, I think there's no evidence to support this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe there's a lot of things to ask there. Maybe just to linger on NATO expansion, what is NATO expansion? What is the threat of NATO expansion and why is this such a concern for Russia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>their throat after 2008, the same way we did in 1999 and 2004, but we were wrong, and it all blew up in our face in 2014. And when it blew up in our face in 2014, what did we do? Did we back off and say, \"Well, maybe the Russians have some legitimate security interest.\" No, that's not the way we operate. We continued to double down. And the end result is that in 2022, you got a war. And as I've argued for a long time now, we, the West, are principally responsible for that, not Vladimir Putin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the expansion of NATO is primarily responsible for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>strategy had two other dimensions. One was EU expansion, and the third was the Color Revolution. We were trying to force Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the basic goal there was to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western, liberal democracy. And that meant that you'd have Ukraine, if it worked, as a pro-Western liberal democracy that was in the EU, and that was in NATO. This was our goal. And the Russians made it unequivocally clear Ukraine was not going to become a Western bulwark on their border, and most importantly, they made it clear that Ukraine in NATO was unacceptable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we talk about the mind of Vladimir Putin? You've mentioned this idea that he has aspirations for imperialist conquest, that he dreams of empire, is not grounded in reality. He wrote an essay in 2021, about one people.

He thinks it's a tragedy that the Soviet Union fell apart, but as he made clear in that essay, the July 12th, 2021 essay, and as he made clear in speeches before, immediately before he invaded Ukraine, he accepted the breakup of the Soviet Union, and he accepted the status quo in Europe, save for the fact he did not accept the idea that Ukraine would become part of NATO.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's been in power for over two decades. Is there a degree that power can affect a leader's ability to see the world clearly, as they say, corrupt? Do you think power has corrupted Vladimir Putin, to a degree?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>performance over the course of the 23 years that he's been in power. I've studied him as a strategist, and I've studied how he deals with the West, and deals with the international system more generally since 2014. And I think he is a first class strategist. This is not to say he doesn't make mistakes, and he admits he's made some mistakes, but I think that the West is dealing with a formidable adversary here. And I don't see any evidence that he's either lost speed off his fastball, or that power has corrupted his thinking about strategic affairs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So he has consistently put, as a primary concern, security? As does the United States, he's put for Russia's security, making sure that NATO doesn't get close to its borders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>after December 1991, when the Soviet Union fell apart, up until, I would argue, about 2017, we were incredibly powerful. And even after 2017, up to today, the United States remains the most powerful state in the system. And because of our geographical location, we are in a terrific situation to survive in any great power competition. So you have a situation involving the United States that's different than the situation involving Russia. They're just much more vulnerable than we are. And therefore, I think Putin tends to be more sensitive about security than any American president in recent times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Europe on one side, China on the other side. It's a complicated situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to understand full well, why the idea of bringing Ukraine up to their border really spooked them. I don't understand why more Americans don't understand that, it befuddles me. I think it has to do with the fact that Americans are not very good at putting themselves in the shoes of other countries. And you really, if you're going to be a first class strategist in international politics, you have to be able to do that. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and think about how they think, so you don't make foolish mistakes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And as a starting point, Americans tend to see themselves as the good guys and a set of others as the bad guys.

It's like that funny skit. Are we the baddies? Consider the United States could be the bad guys. First of all, see the world, if the United States is the bad guys and China is the good guys, what does that world look like? Be able to just exist with that thought, because that is what the Chinese leadership and many Chinese citizens, if not now, maybe in the future, will believe.

Over 240 were taken hostage. Then, in response, as we sit today, Israel's military response has killed over 10,000 people in Gaza. And given the nature of the demographics, it's a very heavily young population. Over 40% of them are under the age of 18, of those killed.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Israel. In a perfect world where there was no lobby and an American president was free to put pressure on Israel, to coerce Israel, I believe, we would've gone a long way towards getting two-state solution. And I believe, this would've been in Israel's interest. But we couldn't get a two-state solution because it was almost impossible to put meaningful pressure on Israel because of the lobby. So this was not in Israel's interest and it was not in America's interest. And that was the argument that we made. And we, of course, got huge pushback for making that argument.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's the underlying motivation of the lobby? Is it religious in nature? Is it similar to the way war hawks are sort of militaristic in nature? Is it nationalistic in nature?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in any meaningful sense of that term. But they self-identify as Jewish in the sense that they feel they're part of a Jewish nation. And that in addition to being an American, they are part of this tribe, this nation called Jews. And that they have a responsibility to push the United States in ways that support the Jewish state. So I think that's what drives most, if not almost all the Jews. This is not to say there's not a religious dimension for some of them, but I think that the main connection is much more tribal in nature.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I had a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu and he said, \"Fundamentally, if you're anti-Zionist, you're antisemitic.\" So the Zionist project is tied to the hip to the Jewish project, what do you have to say to that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there is a rich tradition of anti-Zionism.

There were all sorts of European Jews who were opposed to Zionism. Were they antisemites? I don't think so. But we've gotten to the point now where people are so interested in stopping any criticism of Israel that they wield this weapon of calling people antisemites so loosely that the term has kind of lost meaning.

And so it's very effective. But it is important to talk about these issues, in my humble opinion. And I think if we had talked about these issues way back when, it would've gone a long way towards maybe getting a two-state solution, which I think was the best alternative here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's complicated. And I wonder if you can comment on the complexity of this, because criticizing Israel and criticizing the lobby can, for a lot of people, be a dog whistle for sort of antisemitic conspiracy theories. That this idea that Jews run everything, run the world, they're this kind of cabal. And it's also very true that people who are legitimately antisemitic are also critics of Israel in the same kind of way. And so, it's such a complicated landscape in which to have discussions. Because even people like David Duke who are racist, don't sound racist on the surface. I haven't listened to him enough. But there's dog whistles. It's a complicated space in which to have discussions. I wonder if you can sort of speak to that. Because there's this silencing effect of calling everybody antisemitic.

And this was true before we wrote the article. And we said in the article, in the book, and you heard me say it here, first of all, it's not a Jewish lobby. Secondly, it's not a cabal.

Underneath it all is just, I wonder why there is so much hate against groups, why it's such a sticky way of thinking.

To ask to go back to World War II. Now, you said you studied Nazi Germany in the '30s from a perspective of maybe offensive realism, but just to look at the Holocaust, it's sometimes popular in public discourse today to compare certain things to the Holocaust. People have compared the Hamas attack on Israel to the Holocaust, saying things like, \"It's the biggest attack on Jews since the Holocaust,\" which kind of implies that there's a comparison.

What Hamas did pales in comparison. It's hard to believe anybody would make that argument. Yes, a lot of Jews died, but hardly any compared to the number that died at the hands of the Germans. No parallel at all. And furthermore, Hamas was in no position to kill all of the Jews in the Middle East, just not going to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's also levels of things, Germans using human skin for lamps.

And the belief there is that if they destroy Hamas, they've solved the problem. But as many Israelis know, including people on the hard right, even if you destroy Hamas, they are going to be replaced by another resistance group and that resistance group will employ terror.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

In other words, they're not going to beat the Palestinians into submission, they're not going to finish off Hamas. And at the same time, by pursuing this strategy, they're doing huge damage to their reputation around the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the wake of October 7th, given the geopolitical context, I think there's a lot of leverage to be the great ethical superpower, demonstrate power without killing any civilians, and use that leverage diplomatic leverage to push forward something like Abrahamic Accords with more nations, with Saudi Arabia, push for peace aggressively, peace agreements, this kind of stuff, economic relationships, all of this kind of stuff, and thereby pressure the Palestinian authority towards perhaps the two-state solution.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be disastrous. So you have to have a very smart policy. You have to build powerful military forces, and you have to make sure you don't do anything that's provocative. On Taiwan, for example, the last thing you want is for the Taiwanese government to declare its independence because the Chinese have said, \"If Taiwan does that, we'll go to war.\" And of course, we don't want that. So my view is you want to smartly build up your military forces and you want to do everything you can to contain China, and at the same time, not be provocative.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a big component of that is making sure the US military is bigger than the Chinese military.<|eot_id|>"}

Second best strategy is a stalemate, nobody wins. Third best strategy is they win, but they pay a godawful price.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, in your scenario, where China already dominates Asia and we dominate the Western hemisphere, I think you start talking about where the most likely places that the United States and China go head-to-head or fight through proxies. I think it is the Gulf or the Middle East and the scenario that you posit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, one question I have... I don't know about you, but for me, unlike with the Soviet Union, and I know I was born there, but even outside of that, the cultural gap, the loss in translation, the communication gap between China and the United States seems to be much greater than that of what was the former Soviet Union and the United States. I see two cultures intermingling and communicating as one of the ways to deescalate future conflict.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think in those days, the Americans were realists, a lot of liberal ideology floating around out there, but the Americans were realists. And I think one of the reasons you avoided a shooting match between the United States and the Soviet Union from '47 to '89 was because both sides, I think understood basic balance of power logic. US China competition is somewhat different. First of all, the Chinese are realists to the core. I've spent a lot of time in China. I basically have rock and roll. I'm basically a rock and roll star in China. The Chinese-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're kind of a big deal in China. I love it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>international politics from a realist perspective. If those various American administrations starting with the Clinton administration had put their realist hat on, they would've understood that NATO expansion into Ukraine was not a good idea, but we had this thoroughly liberal view of the world that dominated our thinking, and it's gone away somewhat since we've moved into Multi-polarity, but not completely. And this makes me a little nervous to pick up on your point. I mean, the United States is thinking about the world in ways that are somewhat different than the Chinese who are real as par excellence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's fascinating. So the Chinese are pragmatic about thinking of the world as a competition of military powers, all the ways in which you described the realist perspective. So that's a hopeful thing, right? If we can achieve stability and a balance of powers through that military competition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the liberalism. It's the possibility that we will pursue a rollback policy. In other words, during the Cold War, we pursued containment. It was whenever anybody talked about American grand strategy towards the Soviet Unions, containment, containment, containment. We now know from the historical record that the United States was not only pursuing containment, it was pursuing rollback. We were trying to roll back Soviet power to put it bluntly, we were trying to wreck the Soviet Union, and I would not be surprised moving forward with regard to China if the United States pursues a serious rollback policy and-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're saying throughout history, United States was always doing that. Always. Where's that from? Why can't we respect the power of other nations?<|eot_id|>"}

You fear the power of other nations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well fear and respect are next door neighbors depending on the neighborhood you're living in, but I just mean it could be very counterproductive to try because if you can empathize with their...

So you want to avoid the uncertainty of potential conflict, caution, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, yes and no. Look, your point is you want to empathize. You want to be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>able to do that, but at the same time, there is this competition for power taking place, and what you want to do is maximize how much power you have relative to the other side, and the other side wants to maximize how much power it has relative to you. So you have this competition for power that's taking place all the time, and that's taking place at the same time you want to have empathy or you want to be able to put yourself in the shoes of the other side. So those two things kind of go together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It just feels less threatening to build up your thing versus try to hurt the other person's thing, the other group's thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But if you build up your own power, you are building up your capability to hurt the other side.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right, but I guess you don't rattle the saber just work on manufacturing sabers.<|eot_id|>"}

This is the danger with rollback that you get too aggressive and you precipitate a war, and you also just have to be very careful what you say. And to go back to your favorite argument, you want to be able to have empathy or put yourself in the shoes of the other side, because if you do something, you want to think smartly about what that other side, how that other side is going to see your action and how they're going to react, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And mostly focus on the carrots, have a giant stick laying around, but never mention it, just focus on the carrots.<|eot_id|>"}

I have a notion that leaders can stop wars just as much as they can start wars.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Chinese that you start a war over Taiwan, it could easily escalate into a nuclear war. You want to understand we both have nuclear weapons, and if either one of us is put into a desperate situation, we may turn to those nuclear weapons and oh, by the way, Xi Jinping, you want to understand that we're out here in the water and using nuclear weapons in the water, it's not the same as using war nuclear weapons on lands. So we may very well use them. I'm not saying we will, but anyway, a little saber rattling. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me just zoom out on human history.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't view the United States as an empire.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you empire as a thing that seeks expansion constantly?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not to say the United States is not an incredibly powerful country that goes all around the world building military bases and stationing troops here, there and everywhere, but we're not running an empire the way the British Empire was run or the French Empire. So the question for me is why did those empires go away? Why did the British Empire go away? If you ever look at a map of the world in 1922 after World War I, it's truly amazing how much of that map is controlled by Britain. They had a huge empire and it's disappeared.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Probably by far the biggest in terms of area empire in human history, I think so.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>any resemblance to the British Empire. So the question is, what happened to that British empire? What happened to the French Empire? What happened to the Belgian Empire? What happened to the Dutch Empire? These were countries that had colonies all over the planet. The Dutch East Indies, Vietnam was French Indochina. Where did those empires go? Two factors finished them off. Number one, nationalism. Nationalism became a very powerful force in the 19th Century. It began to rear its head in the late 18th Century and became a very powerful force in the 19th and certainly in the 20th.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you explain nationalism here?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and it was the coming of the Industrial Revolution. Once the Industrial Revolution comes, an empire is basically an albatross around your neck. I would argue that the British Empire was an albatross around Britain's neck in most of the 20th Century. Some of my friends disagree with that and think there were all sorts of benefits from the British Empire, but you want to remember that in the 20th Century, the three countries that really were powerful were the United States, Germany and the Soviet Union. Those were the big three. Did any of them have an empire? No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a good argument.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the industrial world, you don't need an empire, right?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's no question that empires came and went, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's why Quebec, Montreal, all these big French speaking areas are now part of Canada. So borders change and countries got established. The United States being one, and remember, South American, Central America were once completely dominated by the Spanish, and in the case of Brazil, the Portuguese, but they all in the 19th Century got their independence, and what I'm saying to you is in the 19th and in the 20th Century, there were two forces that were really driving the train. One is nationalism, and then the other is the industrial revolution, which changes the cost benefit analysis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Almost too crazy of a question, but if you look, let me calculate, let's say 500 years from now, and you John Mearsheimer traveled through time and are at a bookstore looking at the entire history of human civilization in a single book.

United States, American women are not having lots of babies these days. No question about that, but we have immigration. We're an immigrant culture. You're a perfect manifestation of that. You're a perfect, you're now an American. That's wonderful. We need more people like you. So when I hear Donald Trump and others arguing that immigration's a terrible thing, this is ridiculous. Immigration is what made us great. It's when my relatives came over in the middle of the 19th Century from Germany and Ireland.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating because there's been a huge concern, America and other developed nations are not having enough children, but you just made me realize in the long arc of history, the United States has gotten really good at integrating immigrants and helping them flourish. The whole diversity of that makes up America.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You're absolutely right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a machinery of integrating other cultures.<|eot_id|>"}

That's why somebody like me, I can't find my distant relative's records in Ellis Island because they came through Castle Garden. Whereas lots of Jews I know, lots of Italians, I know they can find their relatives records in Ellis Island because they came through Ellis Island. The point is, you had all these immigrants who came in roughly between 1835 and 1924 when we shut the gates. It was the only time we've ever really shut the gates in a meaningful way and this is what made America great, all these people, and they made lots of babies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some sense, make America great again, means getting more immigrants in.<|eot_id|>"}

Gen Z is the last majority white generation, subsequent generations, and not majority white. So for anybody who's bothered by this, I'm not bothered by that, but for anybody who is bothered by this, they better good use to it because Americans aren't making enough babies that we can continue to grow population-wise in a robust way. So we need immigration and we're an immigrant culture, and this is a great virtue. It has been a great virtue over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It should be a source of hope, not worry.<|eot_id|>"}
