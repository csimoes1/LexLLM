{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with John Mearsheimer, a professor at University of Chicago and one of the most influential and controversial thinkers in the world. He teaches, speaks and writes about the nature of power and war on the global stage, in history and today. Please allow me to say, once again, my hope for this little journey I'm on. I will speak to everyone on all sides with compassion, with empathy, and with backbone. I'll speak with Vladimir Putin and with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with Russians and with Ukrainians, with Israelis and with Palestinians, with everyone. My goal is to do whatever small part I can to decrease the amount of suffering in the world by trying to reveal our common humanity. I believe that in the end, truth and love wins. I will get attacked for being naive, for being a shill, for being weak. I'm none of those things, but I do make mistakes and I will get better. I love you all. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's John Mearsheimer. Can you explain your view on power in international politics as outlined in your book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics and in your writing since then?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I think power matters, but when we talk about power, it's important to understand that it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a lot of interesting things there. First you said nations in relation to each other is essentially in a state of anarchism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a very important message to not only the Chinese, but to other states in the system. Don't be weak, be as powerful as you can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And we'll talk about it, but humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to something you've also studied, which is Nazi Germany in the 1930s. We'll talk about it, but staying to the psychology and philosophy picture, what's the connection between the will to power in the individual, as you mentioned, and the will to power in a nation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>balance of power, because if they get into trouble there is a higher authority that they can turn to. There is in effect a leviathan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what is the role of military might in this will to power on the national level?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, military mights is what ultimately matters. As I said to you before, the two building blocks of power are population size and wealth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You didn't mention military mights.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think are obvious reasons, then they're going to care about having a powerful military that can protect them if another state comes after them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's not obvious that a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain dominant soul superpower status to military might. But you're saying, as you see the world today, it has to be that way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>know that at some point you might not come after me. You might. And if you're really powerful and I'm not, I'm in deep trouble.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So some of the ideas underlying what you've said, offensive realism, which I would love to talk to you about sort of the history of realism versus liberalism, but some of the ideas you already mentioned, anarchy between states, everybody's trying to develop military capabilities, uncertainty, such an interesting concept. States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them, which is one-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's of enormous importance to the story,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...really important, and so interesting because you also say that this makes realists more cautious and more peaceful, the uncertainty because of all the uncertainty involved here, it's better to approach international politics with caution, which is really interesting to think about. Again, survival, most states interested in survival. And the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational, which-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Most of the time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Most of the time. You call this framework offensive realism. Can you just give an overview of the history of the realism versus liberalism debate as worldviews?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>liberal view, this first liberal theory, is that democracies don't fight other democracies, and therefore the more democracies you have, the more peaceful the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I just sort of try to unpack that a little bit? So the democratic peace theory, I guess, would say that in democracies leaders are elected, and the underlying assumption is most people want peace, and so they will elect peacemakers. So the more democracies you have, the more likely you have peace. And then the realist perspective says that it doesn't matter if the majority of people want peace. The structure of international politics is such that superpowers want to become more super and powerful, and they do that through war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>uncertainty about intentions really helps drive the train. But if you're talking about two democracies, the argument there is that they know each other's intentions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And for you, sure, maybe democracies reduce uncertainty a little bit, but not enough to stop the train.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more peaceful world. So those are the liberal theories, and as you can tell, they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you maybe argue against the economic interdependence and in the institutions that institutions follow rules a little bit? So the golden goose with the golden egg, you're saying that nations are happy to kill the goose because again, they want power.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more important. So there are going to be lots of situations where prosperity and survival come into conflict, and in those cases, survival will win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And maybe you can speak to the different camps of realists. You said offensive and defensive. Can you draw a distinction between those two?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not individuals in some will to power that drives competition and war. What drives competition and war is the structure of the system. It's anarchy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're not as romantic as the human nature realists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's just a world of difference between the two. It's just important to understand that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So within that, from the structural, there's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to gain more power, and they think the likelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great, they'll jump at that opportunity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to linger on the human nature perspective, how do you explain Hitler and Nazi Germany, just one of the more recent aggressive expansions through military might? How do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you would call a will to power, and that has to be married to the structural argument in Hitler's case, and also in Napoleon's case.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there some degree on the human psychology side that resentment, because of what happened after World War I, led to Hitler willing so much power, and then Hitler starting World War II? So this is the human side. Perhaps the reason I asked that question is also because you mentioned the century of humiliation on the China side. So to which degree does humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to World War II?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the fact that he was a congenital aggressor in my lexicon certainly mattered as well, so I don't want to dismiss your point about resentment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So Hitler in particular, the way he wielded, the way he gained so much power, might have been the general resentment of the populace or the German populace.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in the late 1940s, this is the late 1940s after the Third Reich is destroyed in 1945, he is still remarkably popular in the polls.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Stalin is still popular in many parts of Eastern Europe.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And Stalin's popular in many quarters inside Russia, and Stalin murdered more of his own people than he murdered people outside of the Soviet Union.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And still to you, the tides of history turned not on individuals, but on structural considerations. So Hitler may be a surface-layer characteristics of how Germany started war, but not really the reason.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, history is a multidimensional phenomenon-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I hear.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the big, if not the biggest, questions that IR scholars care about, which is what causes security competition and what causes great power war.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Does offensive realism answer the question why Hitler attacked the Soviet Union?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because from a military strategy perspective, there's pros and cons to that decision.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>bit of resistance to Hitler in 1938 at the time of Czechoslovakia, Munich, and there was also quite a bit of resistance in September, 1939.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Internally? Or you mean...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in France, they succeeded in Poland, they succeeded at Munich in 1938. Soviet Union is where they fail. There's hardly any resistance at all, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well, and to say that they failed the Soviet Union, my grandfather fought for the Soviet Union, there was a lot of successes early on. So there's poor military, I would say, strategic decisions along the way, but it caught Stalin off guard. Maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective, terrifyingly so, they could have been successful if certain different decisions were made from a military perspective.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>happened in the initial stages of the conflict, that proved to be the case. The Germans won a lot of significant tactical victories early on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And if they focused and went to Moscow as quickly as possible, again, terrifyingly, so could have been, basically topple Stalin. And one thing that's-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's possible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's possible.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>end I believe that. I think in the end the Soviets would've won no matter what, but I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sometimes, maybe you can educate me, but sometimes they say, just like with Napoleon, winter defeated Hitler in Russia. I think not often enough people tell the story of the soldiers and the motivation and how hard they fight. So it turns out that Ukrainians and Russians are not easy to conquer. They're the kinds of people that don't roll over and fight bravely. There seems to be a difference in certain peoples, in how they see war, how they approach war, how proud they are to fight for their country, to die for their country, these kinds of things. So I think Battle of Stalingrad tells, at least to me, a story of extremely brave fighting on the Soviet side, and that, it's a component of war too. It's not just structural, it's not just military strategy, it's also the humans involved, but maybe that's a romantic notion of war.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>soldiers quickly came to understand they were fighting for their lives. If they were taken prisoner, they would die. So they fought like wild dogs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the story of the Holocaust, of the 6 million Jews, is often told extensively. If Hitler won, conquered the Soviet Union, it's terrifying to think, on a much grander scale than the Holocaust, what would've happened to the Slavic people, to the Soviet people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And that gave them, needless to say, very powerful incentives to fight hard against the Germans, and to make sure that they did not win.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To fast-forward in time, but not in space, let me ask you about the war in Ukraine. Why did Russia invade Ukraine on February 24th, 2022? What are some of the explanations given? And which do you find the most convincing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, clearly, the conventional wisdom is that Putin is principally responsible. Putin is an imperialist, he's an expansionist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the conventional thinking.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and conquer other countries. This is the conventional wisdom. My view is there is no evidence, let me emphasize, zero evidence, to support that argument.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which part? That he would... The imperialist part, the sense that he sought to conquer all of Ukraine, and move on and conquer-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>be in the Baltic States, and eventually end up dominating all of Eastern Europe. As I said, I think there's no evidence to support this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So maybe there's a lot of things to ask there. Maybe just to linger on NATO expansion, what is NATO expansion? What is the threat of NATO expansion and why is this such a concern for Russia?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>2022, you got a war. And as I've argued for a long time now, we, the West, are principally responsible for that, not Vladimir Putin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the expansion of NATO is primarily responsible for that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Ukraine was not going to become a Western bulwark on their border, and most importantly, they made it clear that Ukraine in NATO was unacceptable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we talk about the mind of Vladimir Putin? You've mentioned this idea that he has aspirations for imperialist conquest, that he dreams of empire, is not grounded in reality. He wrote an essay in 2021, about one people. Do you think there is some degree to which he still dreams of the former Soviet Union reuniting?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and he accepted the status quo in Europe, save for the fact he did not accept the idea that Ukraine would become part of NATO.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's been in power for over two decades. Is there a degree that power can affect a leader's ability to see the world clearly, as they say, corrupt? Do you think power has corrupted Vladimir Putin, to a degree?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>here. And I don't see any evidence that he's either lost speed off his fastball, or that power has corrupted his thinking about strategic affairs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So he has consistently put, as a primary concern, security? As does the United States, he's put for Russia's security, making sure that NATO doesn't get close to its borders?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>much more vulnerable than we are. And therefore, I think Putin tends to be more sensitive about security than any American president in recent times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Europe on one side, China on the other side. It's a complicated situation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and think about how they think, so you don't make foolish mistakes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And as a starting point, Americans tend to see themselves as the good guys and a set of others as the bad guys. And you have to be able to empathize that Russians think of themselves as the good guys, the Chinese think of themselves as the good guys, and just be able to empathize. If they are the good guys... It's like that funny skit. Are we the baddies? Consider the United States could be the bad guys. First of all, see the world, if the United States is the bad guys and China is the good guys, what does that world look like? Be able to just exist with that thought, because that is what the Chinese leadership and many Chinese citizens, if not now, maybe in the future, will believe. And you have to kind of do the calculation, the simulation forward from that. And same with Russia, same with other nations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Putin saw. Putin saw us as a malign hegemony. And what Mike thinks, or any American thinks, doesn't matter. What matters is what Putin thinks.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also, the drums of war have been beating for some reason. NATO expansion has been threatened for some reason. So you've talked about NATO expansion being dead, so it doesn't make sense from a geopolitical perspective, on the Europe side, to expand NATO. But nevertheless, that threat has been echoed. So why has NATO expansion been pushed, from your perspective?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>shove it down their throat. So it's a combination of those factors that led us to pursue what I think was ultimately a foolish policy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We've talked about how wars get started. How do you hope the war in Ukraine ends? What are the ways to end this war? What are the ways to achieve peace there? To end the, I would say, senseless death of young men, as always happens in war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a frozen peace, or you get a frozen conflict, and the potential for escalation there will be great. So I think this is a disaster.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a very realist perspective. Let me ask you sort of the human side of it. Do you think there's some power to leaders sitting down, having a conversation, man to man, leader to leader, about this? There is just a lot of death happening. It seems that, from an economic perspective, from a historic perspective, from a human perspective, both nations are losing. Is it possible for Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin to sit down and talk, and to figure out a way where the security concerns are addressed, and both nations can minimize the amount of suffering that's happening, and create a path towards future flourishing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think the answer is no.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Even with the United States involved, three people in the room?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>down, and worked with Bennett, and worked with Erdogan, we might've been able to shut the war down then, but it was the United States.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, let me sort of push back on that. You're correct, but the United States paints this picture that everybody's aligned. Maybe you can correct me, but I believe in the power of individuals, especially individual leaders. Again, whether it's Biden or Trump or whoever goes into a room and says, in a way that's convincing, that no more NATO expansion. And actually just on a basic human level, ask the question of why are we doing all this senseless killing? And look at the interest of one, Russia, look at the interest of the other, Ukraine. Their interests are pretty simple. And say, the United States is going to stay out of this. We're not going to expand NATO, and say all that in a way that's convincing, which is that NATO expansion is silly at this point, China's the big threat. We're not going to do this kind of conflict escalation with Russia. The Cold War's over, let's normalize relations.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let me just embellish your argument, okay?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thank you. I need it.<|eot_id|>"}

In fact, you're going to distrust anything they say.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, distrust anything the West say, but there is individual humans. The way human nature works is when you're sitting across from a person, you can trust a human being while still distrusting the West. I mean, I believe in the power of that. I think with the right leaders, you could sit down and talk, like override the general structural distrust of the West and say, \"You know what? I like this guy or gal, whatever.\" I do hope Zelensky and Putin sit down together and talk, have multiple talks.<|eot_id|>"}

Just in a matter of minutes, how the news travels and how the leaders react. It's terrifying that this little demonstration of power, the ripple effects of it, in a matter of minutes, seconds, what that leads to because it's human emotions.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in my mind that the Hamas forces understood full well that the Israelis would retaliate and they would retaliate in force as they have done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, even the metaphor of mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in many ways. I actually saw Norman Finkelstein, I think, say that, well, then if you use that metaphor, then you could say that Hamas was also mowing the lawn. It's such a horrific image because the result on either side is just the death of civilians. I mean, let me ask you about the death of civilians. So during the attack, 1400 Israelis were killed. Over 240 were taken hostage. Then, in response, as we sit today, Israel's military response has killed over 10,000 people in Gaza. And given the nature of the demographics, it's a very heavily young population. Over 40% of them are under the age of 18, of those killed.

Because even people like David Duke who are racist, don't sound racist on the surface. I haven't listened to him enough. But there's dog whistles. It's a complicated space in which to have discussions. I wonder if you can sort of speak to that. Because there's this silencing effect of calling everybody antisemitic.

I mean, a little bit underlying our discussion is this kind of idea that US is the good guys and China is the bad guys.

I don't know about you, but for me, unlike with the Soviet Union, and I know I was born there, but even outside of that, the cultural gap, the loss in translation, the communication gap between China and the United States seems to be much greater than that of what was the former Soviet Union and the United States.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In the industrial world, you don't need an empire, right?
