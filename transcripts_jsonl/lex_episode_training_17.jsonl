It's a powerful aspect of a civilization to be able to, we can call it stealing which is a negative connotation, but you can also see its integration basically. Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer or the peoples that you interact with. Not every empire does that. There's a lot of nations and empires that when they conquer, they annihilate versus integrate. And so, it's an interesting thing to be able to culturally...

One of the fascinating things about your work, you study Roman life life in the ancient world, but also the details, like we mentioned, you are an expert in armor.

I love it. Sort of answering really important questions about, in this case, armor about military equipment and technology that archeologists can't answer by using all the literary, so all the sources you can to understand what it looked like, what were the materials, using the materials at the time, and actually doing ballistic testing. It's really cool. It's really cool that you see that there's a hole in the literature and nobody studied it, and going hard and doing it the right way to sort of uncover this.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that I think, the Romans really emphasize and becomes a legacy to a lot of civilizations today, where citizenship means something.

So again, it's this very dehumanizing view of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And just a reminder to people in America thinking about this, we have a certain view and picture to what slavery is, a reminder that all of human history, most of human history has had slaves of all colors, of all religions. That's within us, to select a group of people, call them the other, use them as objects, abuse them. And I would say, as a person who believes the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, all of us, every person listening to this is capable of being owner of a slave if they're put in the position, of capable of hating the other, of forming the other, of othering other people. And we should be very careful not to look ourselves in the mirror and remind ourselves that we're human. It's easy to think, \"Okay, well, there's these slaves and slave owners through history. And I would've never been one of those.\" But just like as we would be farmers, we could be both.

It depends on how you define good, but a good king/emperor, different than Caesar in terms of humility, at least being able to play, not to piss off everybody.

Same with the US president, frankly, in terms of the grand arc of history, what is the actual impact? But I would say the big one is probably starting wars, major global wars or ending them in both directions. And then taxation too, as you said. What was the taxation? What was the economic system?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the guy kicked out in 476, was a, quote, \"real Roman\", and the barbarian king who took his place wasn't?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can pick for that, but I can say by around 500, I don't know that we can call whatever exists there the Roman Empire anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, the barbarians make everything complicated because they seem to be willing to fight on every side, and they're like fluid, which they integrate fast, and it just makes the whole thing really tricky to say, yeah, who's a Roman, who is not?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>forming large parts of the Roman army for centuries. Yeah, it's extremely fluid and not at all just clear sides here. So it's a mess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From a military perspective, perhaps, what are some things that stand out to you on the pressure from the barbarians, the conflicts, whether it's the Hans or the Visigoths?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's an interesting concept of how do the Romans see their empire? Does it have a boundary? What are those boundaries?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of didn't supply what they had promised, and so they turned against the Romans with good reason. So the Romans blundered in these things too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So is it correct that the Visigoths fought on the side of the Romans against Attila the Hun?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a bunch of strife.<|eot_id|>"}

That's fascinating. But often, we kind of agree that's something that you've talked about quite a bit is the military perspective is the one that defines the rise and fall of empires. You have a really great lecture series called The Decisive Battles of World History, which is another fascinating perspective to look at world history. What makes a battle decisive?<|eot_id|>"}

So you could pick one of those battles and say that was decisive in setting them on this new path.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's also an opportunity to demonstrate a new technology. And if that technology is effective, it changes history because that was either tactical or literally the technology used. So how important is technology, that technological advantage in war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>more quickly to the new technology will often be the one that wins, and we've seen that story over and over and over again in<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's also interesting how much geography that you mentioned a few times affects wars, the result of wars, the rise and fall of empires, all of it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there is something to that where Roman culture spread successfully is where people grow the same crops. And that's just one of those fundamental things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.

So they were fighting across a larger space- time zone in terms of their technology to move, then World War II took place across.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in a sense, World War II was quite contained.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Smaller. Yeah.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably the biggest problems are the sources themselves, the incompleteness of them, and this gets more intense the farther back we go in time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in every dorm room? A Frisbee. So that's the level of interpretation you have to beware of.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>by being aware of both of those, you can maybe begin to get some grasp, however tentative, on the truth as you might perceive it,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To ask a ridiculous question. When our time, you and I, we together become ancient history, when historians, let's say, 2, 3, 4,000 years from now, look back at our time, and you try to look at the details and reconstruct from that the big picture, what was going on, what do you think they'll say?<|eot_id|>"}
