Hannibal is facing this army of 80, 000 Romans about, and he comes up with strategy called double envelopment. I mean, we can go into it later if you want, but it's this famous strategy where he basically sucks the Romans in, surrounds them on all sides. And in one afternoon at the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal kills about 60,000 Romans. Now, just to put that in perspective, that's more Romans hacked to death in one afternoon with swords than Americans died in 20 years in Vietnam.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Gregory Aldrete, a historian specializing in ancient Rome and military history.

And nowadays, we think of that as an unusual thing, and just psychologically, that's a huge thing. You would've seen multiple of your siblings die. If you were a woman, for example, if you were lucky enough to make it to let's say age 13, you probably would have to give birth four or five times in order just to keep the population from dying out. Those kind of grim mortality statistics, I think, are a huge difference psychologically between the ancient world and the modern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But fundamentally, do you think human nature changed much?

They mucked around in the dirt for a couple decades and they died. They never saw a battle. They never saw a work of art. They never saw a philosopher.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Roman Empire last? That's one of those great questions. The conventional answer is usually sometime in the fifth century, so the 400s AD, so about another 500 years, let's say. So nice kind of even division, 500 years of Republic, 500 years of empire. But you can make very good cases for lots of other dates for the end of the Roman Empire. I actually think it goes all the way through the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, so another 1500 years, but that's a whole other discussion. But so that's your three phases of Roman history,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And in some fundamental way, it still persists today, given how much of its ideas define our modern life, especially in the western world.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, that's what Etruscan kings wore, probably. Gladiator games. We associate those very intensely with the Romans. Well, they probably stole that from the Etruscans. A lot of Roman religion. Jupiter is a thunder God, all sorts of divination. The Romans love to chop open animals and look at their livers and predict the future, that comes from the Etruscans. Watching the flight of birds to predict the future, that comes from the Etruscans. There's a lot of central elements of what we think of as Roman civilization, which actually are borrowings, let's say, from these older, slightly mysterious Etruscans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's a really powerful thing. It's a powerful aspect of a civilization to be able to, we can call it stealing which is a negative connotation, but you can also see its integration basically. Yes, steal the best stuff from the peoples you conquer or the peoples that you interact with. Not every empire does that. There's a lot of nations and empires that when they conquer, they annihilate versus integrate. And so, it's an interesting thing to be able to culturally... The form that the competitiveness takes is that you want to compete in the realm of ideas in culture versus compete strictly in the realm of military conquest.<|eot_id|>"}

Rome kind of loses every battle, but wins the war. Pyrrhus one of, actually, his officers has a great line as they're going back to Greece.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So that's the secret to Rome's early success.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's not the military strategy. It's not some technological asymmetry of power. It's literally just manpower.<|eot_id|>"}

The next guy, Hadrian's from Spain, and then a century later, you have Septimius Severus, who's from North Africa. You would later get guys from Syria.

They have kids within the system, their kids become Roman Legionaries, and you've thoroughly integrated what could have been your biggest enemies, right? Your greatest threat.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's just brilliant, brilliant process of integration.

So, I mean, you can just look at a map and see this stuff coming. Sometimes geography is inevitability, and I think in the course of the wars between Rome and Carthage called the Punic Wars, there is this geographic inevitability to them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you speak to the Punic Wars?

I mean, the Battle of Gettysburg, which lasted three days and was one of the bloodiest battles of civil war, I think the actual deaths at that were maybe like 15,000.

So he's writing this entire history as a way to try and understand how did the Romans do it? We were these wonderful superior people, and they came around in 50 years, bang, that's the end of us. So that's his motivation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could you maybe speak to any interesting details of the military genius of Hannibal or Scipio?

On the eastern front, they had a bunch of these cauldron battles where they would go around and try to encircle huge chunks of the Soviet, the Russian army, and do the same thing. Supposedly even in the Gulf War, it was part of the US strategy for the invasion of Iraq to do this kind double envelopment maneuver. So it's something that for the rest of military history, has been an inspiration to other armies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you speak to maybe, the difference between heavy infantry and cavalry, the usefulness of it in the ancient world?<|eot_id|>"}

So this is the new Roman system with flexibility versus the old invincible Alexander system with the heavily armed sarissa with those long 15-foot poles. And the key moment in the battle is where they lock together And in a head-on clash, the Macedonians are going to win, but the Romans have the flexibility to break off a little section of their army, run around to the side, and attack that formation from the side, and they win the battle. So they prove tactically superior because of their flexibility.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Bottom line is a one centimeter thick linothorax, laminated, or even sewn. It doesn't have to be laminated. Layer of linen is about as good protection as two millimeters of bronze, which was the thickest, comparable, body armor of bronze at the time. And we're talking fourth century, fifth century BC here, so classical and Hellenistic Greece, and that would've protected you from, let's say, random arrow strikes on the battlefield. So you could have gotten hit by arrows and they simply wouldn't have gone through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are the benefits?

In fact, probably, this is interesting, any woman in the ancient world could have made one of these because they were the ones who spun thread and sewed it into fabric. So I can easily see in a household a mother making this for her son, a wife making it for her husband. So it's a form of armor you could have made domestically that would've been maybe not the greatest armor, but pretty good, pretty comparable to bronze armor.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's amazing that you used all the materials they had at the time and none of the modern techniques, but I should probably say, maybe you can speak to that, they were probably much better at doing that than you are, right?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and it's cheap. But in the ancient world, they did have basically the equivalent of super glues. I mean, we found, for example, a helmets that were fished out river in Germany that had metal parts glued together that after 2,000 years of immersion and water were still glued together. So they had some great glues. We just don't know what the recipes for them were. So we went the opposite tack and said, \"Well, we're just going to make something that we know they could have made.\" So it was at least this good, you know what I'm saying?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But actually, this is a materials thing, but I think glue, aside from helping glue things together, it can also be a thing that serves as armor.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... the integrity of the material. That's an art and the size probably that they understood deeply.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's all of the above, because again, every piece of armor in the ancient world was an individual creation. So I think if you had some spare leather, you put that in. If you wanted to make one that was just sewn together, or even quilted stuffed with stuff you do that, maybe you were good at gluing stuff, you use that. So I think there's no one answer. We investigated one possibility because we just had limited time and money and resources, but I think all these other things existed at the same time and we're variants of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just as a small aside, I just think this is a fascinating journey you went on. I love it. Sort of answering really important questions about, in this case, armor about military equipment and technology that archeologists can't answer by using all the literary, so all the sources you can to understand what it looked like, what were the materials, using the materials at the time, and actually doing ballistic testing. It's really cool. It's really cool that you see that there's a hole in the literature and nobody studied it, and going hard and doing it the right way to sort of uncover this.

I did a book on floods where I had to get really heavy into vectors of disease and hydraulics and engineering and all that stuff, and I think, again, having that sort of hard science combined with a humanist background, helps with those sorts of projects.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, like you said, I think the details help you understand deeply the big picture of history.

Let's not whitewash them. I mean, they had moments when they would just wipe out entire cities. But on the whole, they were much more about trying to bring people into the Roman world.

And I mean, the most famous Roman order of all time, Cicero, is a guy who made his entire career in the law courts. And that's how he made his reputation, was able to parlay that into political power and eventually was elected to the highest office in the Roman government. But it's purely because of his skill, his facility, using words at giving speeches in public.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So they loved the puzzle and the game of law, the sort of untangling really complicated legal situations and coming up with new laws that help you tangle and untangle the situations.<|eot_id|>"}

So that's all tied up in the Roman orator too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we're talking a bit about the details of the laws.

It's a special status.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you mentioned slaves, slavery, that's something that is common throughout human history.

I was enslaved.

And the odd thing is, in the city of Rome, many of the worst jobs, so if you're just a laborer hauling crap around at the docks or things like that, you might well be a free person and a slave would hold a skilled job.

I mean, you can go to a museum today and see this little bronze collar with a tag on it that's talking about a human being as if they're this kind of animal that's run away. And this is very telling too. We're talking about Roman law. Under Roman law, technically, when a slave runs away, the crime that he's committing is theft because he's stolen himself from his master. So again, it's this very dehumanizing view of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And just a reminder to people in America thinking about this, we have a certain view and picture to what slavery is, a reminder that all of human history, most of human history has had slaves of all colors, of all religions. That's within us, to select a group of people, call them the other, use them as objects, abuse them. And I would say, as a person who believes the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man, all of us, every person listening to this is capable of being owner of a slave if they're put in the position, of capable of hating the other, of forming the other, of othering other people. And we should be very careful not to look ourselves in the mirror and remind ourselves that we're human. It's easy to think, \"Okay, well, there's these slaves and slave owners through history. And I would've never been one of those.\" But just like as we would be farmers, we could be both.

I mean, he's doing this to further his own political power, but he's presenting himself as a populist in essence, even though he aspires to be a dictator. Right? But it's a way of winning the people's support because that's a tool for him and his struggle with other aristocrats.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So a dictator in populist clothing.<|eot_id|>"}

Is it going to be Lepidus? Is it going to be Sextus Pompey? Is it going to be Octavian?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So now, looking back at all that history, it just feels like history turns on so many interesting accidents.

It depends on how you define good, but a good king/emperor, different than Caesar in terms of humility, at least being able to play, not to piss off everybody. But it could have been so many other people. That could have been the fall of Rome. So it's a fascinating little turn of history. Maybe Caesar saw something in this individual.

He calls himself Imperator, which is traditionally something that soldiers shout at, a victorious general who's won a battle. And now he takes this as a permanent title. So, it implies he's a good general. And by the way, it's from Imperator that we get the word emperor, an empire. So, originally it's a military title, a spontaneous military acclamation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just fascinating that he figured out a way through public image, through branding to gain power, maintain power, and still pacify the boiling turmoil that led to the civil wars.<|eot_id|>"}

And secondly, even though Augustus always seemed sickly his constitution, he lives forever. He rules for like 50 years, and by the time he dies, there's no one literally almost left alive who can remember the Republic.

She seemed to have actually cared about Egypt and identified with it and succeeded at a time with all these famous people in being a real mover and shaker and a force in events.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, she's probably one of the most influential women in human history.<|eot_id|>"}

And on the breastplate right in the middle of the stomach is a Parthian handing over a golden eagle legionary standard to a Roman. So, this is what Augustus thought of as his greatest achievement.

The culture and history of the Mediterranean Basin, the western world, and even global history itself, were all profoundly shaped and influenced by the actions and legacy of Octavian.

Everybody knows that certain musical tones will make you feel a certain way.\" Think of movies today: in a horror movie, they're going to play strident, tense music. In a romantic scene, you're going to have strings, and it'll make you feel a certain way. When you hear the Jaws theme, you feel tense. Cicero said, \"The orator's body is like a lyre.\" A lyre is a musical instrument. \"And you have to learn to play on your own body as a musical instrument to affect the emotions of your audience.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think he might be onto something, especially given how central public speaking was in Roman culture.<|eot_id|>"}

In fact, in the ancient world, the most famous Greek orator was a guy named Demosthenes. And once a guy came up to Demosthenes and said, \"Demosthenes, tell me: what are the three most important things in giving a speech?\" And Demosthenes said, \"Well, they are delivery, delivery, and delivery.\" That even the most brilliant speech, if accompanied by a boring delivery, is going to be less effective than a terrible speech given in an engaging and exciting or funny way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Speaking of modern day and gestures, what do you think of Donald Trump, who has these very unique kind of gestures?

If you watch some of his speeches; even just turn off the sound and watch them; he's doing all kinds of stuff. And he's really emphasizing his points in a very creative way. This is what's fascinating about oratory and public speaking, is it's this two-edged sword. You can use these techniques for good, or you can absolutely use them for evil.

You're right, he's channeling the resentment of the people and using that to his personal advantage and for cynical, evil really, purposes. But oratory is like that. The question I always end up asking my students, after studying Cicero and all these techniques, I say, \"Okay, this is great oratory. But do you like this? Is this good that this works on human beings?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I remember Noam Chomsky once was asked, \"Why do you speak in such a monotone way?\" And he said, \"Well, I want the truth of my statement, the content of my statements to speak; that I don't want you to get deluded by me because I'm such a charismatic and eloquent speaker.

So not enough gesticulation is a problem. Too much gesticulation is a problem. You have to hit the sweet spot. It has to seem natural. It has to seem varied.

So I think that's a real transition point where religion started to become so foregrounded.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... most of the time?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a really important idea to remember. Same with the US president, frankly, in terms of the grand arc of history, what is the actual impact? But I would say the big one is probably starting wars, major global wars or ending them in both directions. And then taxation too, as you said. What was the taxation? What was the economic system? What was the role of taxation in the Roman Empire?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>originally, there was this notion that's shameful, again, the only thing that's a worthwhile profession is farming. So rich Romans would get involved in what we would call business manufacturing, particularly long distance trade with ships, but they would often do it through sort of front companies or employees who did it on their behalf, officially, and then they funneled the profits to the guy funding it because they don't want to be soiled with business, which is beneath them. So the Romans had a lot of weird attitudes about the economy that I think in some ways didn't help.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But nevertheless, they had many of the elements of the modern economic system with taxation, the record keeping.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They were good at record keeping. So the Romans... I mean, the census is a Roman word. They're the ones that came up with that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And obviously, the laws around everything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. So in certain ways, yes, they were extremely sophisticated. And of course, the biggest thing about people in the ancient world and today is that they weren't stupider than us. I mean, sometimes you get this assumption, oh, well, in the ancient world, they just weren't as smart or something. No, no, no. They were fully as intelligent as we were. They didn't have access to the same technology as we do, but that doesn't mean they were any less smart.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can we talk about the Crisis of the Third century and the aforementioned Western and Eastern Roman Empires, how it's split?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the economy is kind of tanking. Then there's less money coming in as taxes. So when one guy finally wins, he jacks up the tax rate to try and make up for it, but now, there's fewer people able to pay, and it's all just a vicious cycle. The Romans start to debase the coinage, which means you take in a gold coin, you melt it down, mix it in with 10% something less valuable, and then stamp it and say it's worth the same. Well, people aren't stupid. They're going to know that's only 90% of that gold coin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They've invented inflation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and he tries to stabilize the economy. One of the things he does is he issues a new solid gold coin that he guarantees is solid gold. And he calls it a Solidus, a solid coin. He famously issues a price edict where he says, \"This is the maximum it's legal to charge for any good or service.\" So it's attempt to curb inflation. And that's not going to work, but it helps. Kind of amusingly on Diocletian's price edict, can you guess what the most expensive sort of item is? Hiring a lawyer. So some things never change, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, that's interesting. I mean, in that system, there's probably a huge amount of lawyers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>naturally fragment. And at times, they try systems where they split it into four. So under Diocletian, he tries the tetrarchy, where he splits the empire into four, and you actually have sort of four emperors working together as a team. More commonly, it just splits east, west. So from that point on, you really start to have the history of the Western Empire going in one direction, the Eastern Empire in the other. You tend to have two emperors, though there are moments occasionally where they reunite. So that's a big development as well. And that's a turning point.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the most common date that people say, maybe you can correct me on this, that the Roman Empire fell was 476 AD. They're referring to the \"fall\", quote, unquote, of the Western Roman Empire. So why did the Roman Empire fall?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have to ask yourself, who counts as a real Roman by that point? Because for a while now, the Romans themselves are often coming from barbarians, are crossing that boundary, Roman generals. They might get raised as a Hun, then serve with the Roman army for a while, then not, or a Visigoths or not. That's been going on for a long time. So what makes someone a real Roman? How do you tell that the guy kicked out in 476, was a, quote, \"real Roman\", and the barbarian king who took his place wasn't? That's a very arbitrary decision.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's so many interesting things there. So of course, you described really eloquently the decline that started after Marcus Aurelius, and there's a lot of competing ideas there. And the tensions-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just to interrupt you, I hate wishy-washy answers, which is what I kind of said. So I will give you this, I think by the end of the 5th century AD, the Western Roman Empire has transformed into something different. So I don't know what date I can pick for that, but I can say by around 500, I don't know that we can call whatever exists there the Roman Empire anymore.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And of course, the barbarians make everything complicated because they seem to be willing to fight on every side, and they're like fluid, which they integrate fast, and it just makes the whole thing really tricky to say, yeah, who's a Roman, who is not? And at which point did it-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And barbarians have been forming large parts of the Roman army for centuries. Yeah, it's extremely fluid and not at all just clear sides here. So it's a mess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From a military perspective, perhaps, what are some things that stand out to you on the pressure from the barbarians, the conflicts, whether it's the Hans or the Visigoths?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>if you look back at someone like Virgil, at the time of Augustus, he said, well, the Gods granted Rome empire without end. So it's that open-ended thing. But even under Augustus, he seems to be pulling back and saying, \"Well, I'm going to kind of stop at the Rhine. I'm going to kind of stop at the Danube. We don't need to keep expanding forever in the way we've been doing.\" So I mean, that's an interesting concept of how do the Romans see their empire? Does it have a boundary? What are those boundaries? What does that mean?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then barbarians were very much making that boundary even more difficult to kind of define it even if you wanted to.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the empire? And in return, we will fight for you against external enemies.\" And the Romans make these deals with some of the Goths. In fact, they made a pretty good deal with the Goths, one group of Goths to do exactly that. You can settle within the boundaries. We'll feed you, we'll give you a certain amount of stuff, and you fight for us. And then the Romans treated them really badly. They kind of didn't supply what they had promised, and so they turned against the Romans with good reason. So the Romans blundered in these things too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So is it correct that the Visigoths fought on the side of the Romans against Attila the Hun?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the lunch, Attila goes back and says, \"Eh, I changed my mind. We're going to go back up to France, hang around for another year. We'll finish off the Romans later.\" And Christian sources say, \"Saints appeared in the sky with flaming swords and scared away Attila.\" Some other sources say, \"Well, the Pope gave Attila a huge bribe to go away for a while,\" believe whichever you like, but then Attila ends up dying on his wedding night before he comes back under mysterious circumstances and so that never materializes. And the Huns kind of fragment after his death.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what was the definitive blow by the barbarians, by the Visigoths?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it was surrounded by swamps, so it was more defensible. But there is something important about that old symbolic capital now just collapsing in terms of population, numbers, really no longer having importance because literally its food supply is cut off by losing those areas of the empire. And of course, the capital... Constantine had founded a new second capital at what used to be Byzantium, a Greek city on the Bosporus, which becomes Constantinople. He names it not very modestly after himself, and that now is really the dominant city for any of the Roman Empire's eastern or western.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you're actually living in that century, the 5th century, it's kind of like the Western Roman Empire dies with a whimper. It's not like-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a bunch of strife.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>sort of late Roman little ice age and everything goes downhill and that's what caused it. There's some that say things like disease. There were a whole series of waves of plague that started to hit under Marcus Aurelius and continued after him, which seemed to have caused real serious death and economic disruption. I mean, that's a decent explanation. Another popular one is moral decline, which I don't think really works well. You even get the people saying lead poisoning, but that's not true because they were drinking out of the same pipes when the empire was expanding, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's fascinating. That's fascinating. But often, we kind of agree that's something that you've talked about quite a bit is the military perspective is the one that defines the rise and fall of empires. You have a really great lecture series called The Decisive Battles of World History, which is another fascinating perspective to look at world history. What makes a battle decisive?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>either allow some new people or idea or institution to either grow or have its growth curbed. So at various points, we have empires that were expanding and basically were stopped at some battle. And so you say, \"Well, if they been stopped there, they might have gone on to dominate this whole area.\" Or conversely, you could say, \"Rome wasn't...\" They were one place before the second Punic War. After the second Punic War, they were its dominant force. So you could pick one of those battles and say that was decisive in setting them on this new path.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's also an opportunity to demonstrate a new technology. And if that technology is effective, it changes history because that was either tactical or literally the technology used. So how important is technology, that technological advantage in war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's this moment of incredibly fast technological change. Going into World War II, everybody thinks it's all about battleships. Who's got the biggest battleships? Four years later, battleships are just junk. Let's just scrap them. It's all about aircraft carriers and that's everything war at sea. So you have these moments of, particularly in warfare, almost accelerated technological change where things happen very rapidly and the civilization or the nation or the army that adapts more quickly to the new technology will often be the one that wins, and we've seen that story over and over and over again in<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's also interesting how much geography that you mentioned a few times affects wars, the result of wars, the rise and fall of empires, all of it. As silly as it is, it's not the people or the technology, it's like sometimes literally that there's rivers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the Roman Empire isn't any of these maps with political borders. It would be a map that shows the zone in which it's possible to cultivate olives.\" So if you simply get a map and map onto it where you could grow olives during this time, let's say, 1st century AD, it corresponds exactly, I mean really closely, to the areas that are most heavily Romanized. Now, I'm not going to say that, but there is something to that where Roman culture spread successfully is where people grow the same crops. And that's just one of those fundamental things.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, you so beautifully put that the perspective can change dramatically how you see history, I mean, you could probably tell world history through what? Through olives, cinnamon and gold.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>foods. And of course, the cliche for the Romans of what barbarians eat is red meat. They're herders, so they're not farmers, but they follow herds of cow around, which a totally different lifestyle. They eat dairy products, and they drink beer. And I tell my students sometimes that if you were to stick a Roman in a time machine and send them to where we live, which I teach in Wisconsin, Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Roman would step out, look around, see all the beer, the brats, and the cheese, say, \"I know who you guys are. You're barbarians.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Barbarians. That's another way to draw the boundary between olive oil, wine, wheat, and meat, dairy, and beer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But it's more fundamental because it's different forms of life because if you're a farmer, you grow certain crops. And if you're a farmer, you tend to stay in one place. You tend to build cities. If you're following herds of cows around, you don't build cities, you have a totally different lifestyle. So it's diet, but it's more fundamental underlying things about your entire culture.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And many of the barbarians were nomadic tribes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Some of them are, yeah, definitely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Fascinating. I mean, this is just yet another fascinating way to-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's dietary determinism, geographic determinism. Yeah, these things are big.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>On the topic of war, it may be a ridiculous span of time and scale, but how do you think the world wars of the 20th century compare to the wars that we've been talking about of the Roman Empire, of Greece, and so on?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we sort of, I don't know, somehow factor for transportation time, I mean, I think you can argue that that was a bigger war than World War II. In World War II, if you hopped on a plane, you could get from the US to China in a week or something, right? In little hops. I mean, in the ancient world, if you wanted to go from Spain to Egypt, it would take you a month. So they were fighting across a larger space- time zone in terms of their technology to move, then World War II took place across.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in a sense, World War II was quite contained.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Smaller. Yeah. I mean, if we adjust for that sort of factor, so that was a global war, I think that would be very familiar.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you think the atomic bomb, nuclear weapons changed war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interesting moment right now, I mean, I'm getting way beyond ancient history here, but for a long time, we had this sort of stasis with the nuclear standoff, with mutually assured destruction between the US sort of block of nations and the Soviet ones, and it worked. Now, we're entering this kind of time when a lot more countries are going to start becoming nuclear capable. We might have a resurgence of just building new weapons, platforms with China, seems very eager to expand their nuclear arsenal in all sorts of ways. So it's unnerving time, let's say, right now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's a terrifying experiment to find out if nuclear weapons... When a lot of nations have nuclear weapons, is that going to enforce civility and peace, or is it actually going to be a destabilizing and ultimately civilization destroying?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>over again. And the two mistakes are not understanding the terrain, that it's a rocky mountainous area that people can always hide in caves. And it's not understanding the fundamentally tribal nature of that area that that's where the real allegiance is in these tribes. It's not in a centralized government. And that's the same era Alexander made, as the British made in the 19th century, as the Russians, as the Americans. And it's so depressing as a historian who studies history to see these things being repeated over and over again and you know exactly what's going to happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For leaders not to be learning lessons of history. You co-wrote a book precisely on this topic, The Long Shadow of Antiquity: What have the Greeks and Romans Done For Us? What are the some key elements of antiquity that are reflected in the modern world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>unique parts of our culture or things that we think are just innate to human nature or actually rooted in the past. So this is another power of the past thing, and this is just a long specific list of examples really. So I mean, we go through government and education and intellectual stuff and art and architecture and a lot of the things we've been talking about today, language, culture, medicine. But even things like habits, the way we celebrate things, the way we get married. Our married rituals have all sorts of things in common with Roman weddings.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The calendar.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>decisions about the future without understanding the past. And that's not just true with your own life, but it's in understanding others. So it's not only your own past you have to understand, but you have to understand other people, what's influencing them. So you can't interact with others unless you understand where they're coming from. And the answer to where they're coming from is where they came from and what shaped them and what forces affect them. So I think it's absolutely vital to have some understanding of the past in order to make competent decisions in the present.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What are some of the problems when we try to gain lessons from history and look back? We've spoken about them a bit, the bias of the historian, maybe what are the problems in studying history and how do we avoid them?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably the biggest problems are the sources themselves, the incompleteness of them, and this gets more intense the farther back we go in time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So if you say, \"I want to write a book about the 19th century,\" there is more material available for almost any topic you want to pick than you could possibly go through in your lifetime. If you say, \"I want to write a book about the Roman world,\" this is a very different thing. In my office, I have a bookshelf that's, I don't know, eight feet high, 10 feet wide, and it contains pretty much all the main surviving Greek and Roman literary texts, okay?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what you had for the civilization.

And it's round. So obviously, they're sun worshipers. And if you can decipher the inscription, you'll see that obviously they all worship the great sun god Wham-O. It's like, what do you find in every dorm room? A Frisbee. So that's the level of interpretation you have to beware of. And there's examples, where we've done exactly this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we have to have intellectual humility when we look back into the past.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>trying to reconstruct and to understand a society. It's even more fun where it's, yeah, you have to try to empathize.

But this is what we're doing with ancient civilizations. And as I talked about earlier, sometimes you'll feel great sympathy there. Sometimes you'll feel incomprehension. But by being aware of both of those, you can maybe begin to get some grasp, however tentative, on the truth as you might perceive it,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To ask a ridiculous question. When our time, you and I, we together become ancient history, when historians, let's say, 2, 3, 4,000 years from now, look back at our time, and you try to look at the details and reconstruct from that the big picture, what was going on, what do you think they'll say?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>terms or in self-awareness, or have learned from what's come before. I mean, that's all you can try and do is do a little bit better than whatever came before you to look back at what happened and try to do something. Livy, I mean, one of the great Roman historians, the beginning of his work, A History of Rome, which is this massive thing, he says, \"The utility and the purpose of history is this. It provides you an infinite variety of experiences and models, noble things to imitate and shameful things to avoid.\" And I think he's right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And they would perhaps be better at highlighting which shameful things we started avoiding and which noble things we started imitating.

Well, in that grand perspective, what gives you hope about our future as a humanity, as a civilization?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to this point, what makes us special is the ability to store up an accumulation of knowledge and to pass that knowledge on to the next generation.

Otherwise, we'd all just be starting ground zero kind of just from the beginning. So our ability to store up knowledge and pass it on, I think is our special power as human beings.
