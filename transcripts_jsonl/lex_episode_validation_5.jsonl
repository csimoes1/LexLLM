{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, there's two things. The first most important one was that the planet and the biosphere have evolved together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Together.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then we can, from an outside perspective, analyze planets based on the initial conditions they create.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the point now, now there may be other kinds of principles that actually ... Co-evolution actually has its own. Not deterministic, you're done with determinism.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I agree.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I would agree.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We're talking about temperature where water can be on the surface.

They try to protect them, don't talk about them, don't talk about their location and all this kind of stuff. And I've begun to internalize and understand that perspective of why you're doing that.

So the three ways responses you mentioned is scientific triumphalism, and then on the other side is rejecting science completely, both on the left and the right. I think the postmodernist on the left and the anti-establishment people on the right, and then just pseudoscience that kind of does this in-between thing.

I mean, it has to do with PhDs, it has to do with sitting on an academic throne, all those things. And the human nature with the egos and so on, it builds. And of course, that nobody likes arrogance.

It's difficult to have the rigor of science on top of experience. And so as science advances, we might get better and better.

So imitating humans, and I wouldn't discount either the possibility that through imitation you can achieve what you would call consciousness or agency or the ability to have experience. I think for most of us humans to think, oh, that's just fake. That's copying. But there's some degree to which us, we humans are just copying each other. We just are really good imitation machines coming from babies. We were born in this world and we're just learning to imitate each other. And through the imitation and the tension in the disagreements in the imitations. We gain personality, perspective, all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I don't think LLMs will get there because they can't.

This is a paper, but reflecting on two recent collections, this article reviews the four E paradigm with a view to assessing the strengths and weaknesses. It's fascinating.

Maybe it's the genetics, maybe it's the biochemistry in my brain, but I generally have that joy about experience, amorphous joy.
