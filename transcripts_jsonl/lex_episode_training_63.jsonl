Actually, one very real practical way it makes things worse is when you censor people, it doesn't change their opinion. It just encourages them to not share it with people who will get them in trouble. It leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Greg Lukianoff, free speech advocate, First Amendment attorney, president and CEO of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.

Co-author with Rikki Schlott of a new book coming out in October that you should definitely pre-order now called, The Canceling of the American Mind, which is a definitive accounting of the history, present, and future of cancel culture. A term used and overused in public discourse, but rarely studied and understood with the depth and rigor that Greg and Rikki do in this book, and in part in this conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones that should encourage bold risk-taking, not conformity. This is a Lex Fridman Podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Greg Lukianoff. Let's start with a big question. What is cancel culture? Now, you've said that you don't like the term as it's been quote \"dragged through the mud and abused endlessly\" by a whole host of controversial figures. Nevertheless, we have the term, what is it?<|eot_id|>"}

It's taxpayer funded and generally the legislature is involved.

And that's something where the university, the way you deal with that tension in First Amendment law is essentially of the one positive duty that the government has. The first, the negative duty, the thing that it's not allowed to do is censor you. But its positive duty is that if I want to say awful things, or for that matter, great things that aren't popular in a public park, you can't let the crowd just shout me down. You can't allow what's called a heckler's veto.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Heckler's veto. That's so interesting, because I feel like that comes into play on social media as well.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interesting data in the book about how driving people off of Twitter, for example, in 2017, and then again I think in 2020, driving people to gab led to greater radicalization among those people. It's a very predictable force. Censorship doesn't actually change people's minds and it pushes them in directions that actually, by very solid research, will actually make them more radicalized. So yeah, I think that the attempt to ban hate speech, it doesn't really protect us from it but it gives the government such a vast weapon to use against us that we will regret giving them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a way to look at extreme cases to test this idea out a little bit? So if you look on Campus, what's your view about allowing, say, white supremacists on Campus to do speeches or KKK?<|eot_id|>"}

And in the process, he actually deradicalized a number of Klans members when they actually realized that this Black man who had befriended them actually was compassionate, was a decent person. They realized all their pre-conceptions were wrong. So it can have a deradicalizing factor, by the way. But even when it doesn't, it's still really important to know what the bad people in your society think. Honestly, in some ways, for your own safety, it's probably more important to know what the bad people in your society actually think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know what you think about that but I personally think that freedom of speech in cases like that like KKK and Campus can do more harm in the short term but much more benefit in the long term. Because you can sometimes argue for this is going to hurt in the short term. But I mean, Harvey said this, it's like consider the alternative. Because you've just made the case for this potentially would be a good thing even in the short term.And it often is, I think, especially in a stable society like ours. Whether it's strong middle class, all these kinds of things where people have the comforts, the reason through things. But to me, it's like even if it hurts in the short term, even if it does create more hate in the short term, the freedom of speech has this really beneficial thing which is it helps you move towards the truth, the entirety of society towards a deeper, more accurate understanding of life on earth, of society, of how people function, of ethics, of metaphysics, of everything. And that, in the long term, is a huge benefit. It gets rid of the Nazis in the long term, even if it adds to the number of Nazis in the short term.<|eot_id|>"}

And the reality check part of this is people will always bring up, \"What about the Klan on Campus?\" I'm like, \"They're never invited. I haven't seen a case where they've been invited.\" Usually, the Klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse... And that's why we shouted down Ben Shapiro and that's why you can't have Bill Maher on Campus. That's why... And it's like, \"Okay.\" And it's a little bit of that what about-ism again about being like, \"Well, that thing over there is terrible and therefore this comedian shouldn't come.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I do have a question maybe by way of advice.<|eot_id|>"}

That's something I have to come face to face with on occasion. My natural inclination before I started the podcast was I would talk to anyone and including people which I'm still interested in who are the current members of the KKK. And to me, there's a responsibility to do that with skill and that responsibility has been weighing heavier and heavier on me because you realize how much skill it actually takes because you have to know to understand so much. Because I've come to understand that the devil is always going to be charismatic, the devil's not going to look like the devil. And so, you have to realize you can't always come to the table with a deep compassion for another human being. You have to have 90% compassion and another 90% deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue and that takes just a huge amount of effort. But I don't know if there's thoughts you have about this, how to handle speech in a way without censoring, bringing it to the surface, but in a way that creates more love in the world.<|eot_id|>"}

So the more time you give to a particular conversation, really deep thought and historical context and studying the people, how they think, looking at all different perspectives, looking at the psychology of the person, the upbringing, their parents, their grandparents, all of this. The more time you spend with that, the better the quality of the conversation is because you get to really empathize with the person, with the people he or she represents, and you get to see the common humanity, all of this. Interviewers often don't do that work. So the best stuff I've seen is interviews that are part of a documentary. But even now, documentaries are like there's a huge incentive to do as quickly as possible. There's not an incentive to really spend time with the person.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Truth is hard to know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it is true that there is a left-leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that, what happens is on articles, which I mostly appreciate, that don't have a political aspect to them, scientific articles or technical articles, they can be really strong. Even history, just describing the facts of history that don't have a subjective element, strong. Also, just using my own brain, I can filter out if it's something about January 6th, or something like this, I know I'm going to be like, whatever's going on here, I'm going to kind of read it, but mostly I'm going to look to other sources, I'm going to look to a bunch of different perspectives on it. It's going to be very tense, there's probably going to be some kind of bias, maybe some wording will be such, which is this is where Wikipedia does its thing, the way they word stuff will be biased, the choice of words. But the Wikipedia editors themselves are so self-reflective they literally have articles describing these very effects, of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talked about it.<|eot_id|>"}

One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me that Community Notes on X does better is the accessibility of becoming an editor, it's difficult to become an editor, and it's not as visible, the process of editing. So I would love, like you said, a stream, for everyone to be able to observe this debate between people with integrity, of when they discuss things like January 6th, of very controversial topics, to just see how the process of the debate goes, as opposed to being hidden in the shadows, which it currently is in Wikipedia. You can access that, it's just hard to access. And I've also seen how they will use certain articles on certain people. Articles about people I've learned to trust less and less, because they literally will use those to make personal attacks. And this is something you write about, they'll use descriptions of different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't, to me at least, feel like an accurate representation of the person. And it's like writing an article about Einstein, mentioning something about theory of relativity and then saying that he was a womanizer and abuser and controversy. Yeah, he is, Feynman also, they're not exactly the perfect human in terms of women. But there's other aspects to this human, and to capture that human properly, there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean, they really try to be self-reflective and try to stop this, but they will lean into the drama if it matches the bias. But again, the world, I believe, is much better because Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in these adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies, the idea of a stream is really, really interesting, because you get more and more people into this discourse where the value is, let's try to get the truth.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Thinking that your cause is social justice in many cases can lead people to think, I can be as cruel as I want in pursuit of this, when a lot of times it's just a way to vent some aggression on a person that you think of only as an abstraction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I think it's important for people to realize that whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you want to put out there, there's real people that can get hurt. You can really get people to one, be the worst version of themselves, or two, possibly take their own life, and it's not as real.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>now we know words can hurt? Guys, you didn't have to come up with a special little thing that you teach children to make words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place, it wouldn't even make sense, the saying, it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength when the bullies have noticed you're a little weird. This might be a little personal. And it helps, it really does help to be like, listen, okay, assholes are going to say asshole things, and I can't let them have that kind of power over me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah, it still is a learning experience because it does hurt.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But for the good people out there who actually just sometimes think that they're venting, think about it, remember that there are people on the other side of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, for me it hurts my faith in humanity, I know it shouldn't, but it does sometimes, when I just see people being cruel to each other, it floats a cloud over my perspective of the world that I wish didn't have to be there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. That was always my flippant answer to, if mankind is basically good or basically evil, being the biggest debate in philosophy, and being like, well, the problem, first is there's nothing basic about humanity.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. What gives you hope about this whole thing? About this dark state that we're in as you describe, how can we get out, what gives you hope that we will get out?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Harvard a lot, but I'm going to pick on them a little bit more. I talk a lot about class, again, and there's a great book called Poison Ivy by Evan Mandery, which I recommend to everybody, it's outrageous, it sounds like me on a rant at Stanford, which was, and I think the stat is elite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they have from the bottom 50 or 60% depending on the school. And when you look at how much they actually replicate class privilege, it's really distressing. So everybody should read Poison Ivy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And above all else, if you're weird, continue being weird.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, please.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest, in the most beautiful way, people I've ever met, Greg, thank you for the really important work you do. This was-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everybody watch Kid Cosmic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I appreciate the class, the hilarious that you brought here today, man. This was an amazing conversation, thank you for the work you do. Thank you, thank you. And for me, who deeply cares about education, higher education, thank you for holding the MITs and the Harvards accountable for doing right by the people that walk their halls. So thank you so much for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Greg Lukianoff. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Noam Chomsky, \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked, so was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
