He's the author of Unleashing Liberty, co-author with Jonathan Haidt of Coddling of the American Mind. Co-author with Rikki Schlott of a new book coming out in October that you should definitely pre-order now called, The Canceling of the American Mind, which is a definitive accounting of the history, present, and future of cancel culture. A term used and overused in public discourse, but rarely studied and understood with the depth and rigor that Greg and Rikki do in this book, and in part in this conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones that should encourage bold risk-taking, not conformity. This is a Lex Fridman Podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, dear friends, here's Greg Lukianoff. Let's start with a big question. What is cancel culture? Now, you've said that you don't like the term as it's been quote \"dragged through the mud and abused endlessly\" by a whole host of controversial figures.

Because you've just made the case for this potentially would be a good thing even in the short term.And it often is, I think, especially in a stable society like ours. Whether it's strong middle class, all these kinds of things where people have the comforts, the reason through things. But to me, it's like even if it hurts in the short term, even if it does create more hate in the short term, the freedom of speech has this really beneficial thing which is it helps you move towards the truth, the entirety of society towards a deeper, more accurate understanding of life on earth, of society, of how people function, of ethics, of metaphysics, of everything.

And to me, there's a responsibility to do that with skill and that responsibility has been weighing heavier and heavier on me because you realize how much skill it actually takes because you have to know to understand so much. Because I've come to understand that the devil is always going to be charismatic, the devil's not going to look like the devil. And so, you have to realize you can't always come to the table with a deep compassion for another human being. You have to have 90% compassion and another 90% deep historical knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue and that takes just a huge amount of effort.

So the more time you give to a particular conversation, really deep thought and historical context and studying the people, how they think, looking at all different perspectives, looking at the psychology of the person, the upbringing, their parents, their grandparents, all of this. The more time you spend with that, the better the quality of the conversation is because you get to really empathize with the person, with the people he or she represents, and you get to see the common humanity, all of this. Interviewers often don't do that work. So the best stuff I've seen is interviews that are part of a documentary.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's been projects throughout the internet that have done an incredible job of that, but have been also very flawed. Wikipedia is an example of a big leap forward in doing that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's pretty damn impressive. What's your overall take? I mean, I'm mostly impressed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit Wikipedia, one of which is each editor for themselves declares, I'm into politics and I really am a left leaning guy, so I really shouldn't be editing political articles because I have bias.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They declare their biases, and they often do a good job of actually declaring the biases. But they'll still, they'll find a way to justify themselves, like something will piss them off and they want to correct it, because they love correcting untruth into truth. But the perspective of what is true or not is affected by their bias.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Truth is hard to know.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it is true that there is a left-leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that, what happens is on articles, which I mostly appreciate, that don't have a political aspect to them, scientific articles or technical articles, they can be really strong. Even history, just describing the facts of history that don't have a subjective element, strong. Also, just using my own brain, I can filter out if it's something about January 6th, or something like this, I know I'm going to be like, whatever's going on here, I'm going to kind of read it, but mostly I'm going to look to other sources, I'm going to look to a bunch of different perspectives on it. It's going to be very tense, there's probably going to be some kind of bias, maybe some wording will be such, which is this is where Wikipedia does its thing, the way they word stuff will be biased, the choice of words. But the Wikipedia editors themselves are so self-reflective they literally have articles describing these very effects, of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talked about it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That sounds healthier than most environments.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's incredibly healthy, but I think you could do better. One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me that Community Notes on X does better is the accessibility of becoming an editor, it's difficult to become an editor, and it's not as visible, the process of editing. So I would love, like you said, a stream, for everyone to be able to observe this debate between people with integrity, of when they discuss things like January 6th, of very controversial topics, to just see how the process of the debate goes, as opposed to being hidden in the shadows, which it currently is in Wikipedia. You can access that, it's just hard to access. And I've also seen how they will use certain articles on certain people. Articles about people I've learned to trust less and less, because they literally will use those to make personal attacks. And this is something you write about, they'll use descriptions of different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't, to me at least, feel like an accurate representation of the person. And it's like writing an article about Einstein, mentioning something about theory of relativity and then saying that he was a womanizer and abuser and controversy. Yeah, he is, Feynman also, they're not exactly the perfect human in terms of women. But there's other aspects to this human, and to capture that human properly, there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean, they really try to be self-reflective and try to stop this, but they will lean into the drama if it matches the bias. But again, the world, I believe, is much better because Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in these adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies, the idea of a stream is really, really interesting, because you get more and more people into this discourse where the value is, let's try to get the truth.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>very much, it made such a difference, because I could be open about that. And the other thing was, have you heard this conference Dialogue?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh yes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>me and my family that I was starting to be afraid it would be, that taking the stuff on might actually have a happy ending.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, one thing that just stands out from that is the pain of cancellation can be really intense. And that doesn't necessarily mean losing your job, but just even, you can call it bullying, you can call it whatever name, but just some number of people on the internet, and that number can be small, saying bad things to you, that can be a pretty powerful force to the human psyche, which was very surprising. And then the flip side also of that, it really makes me sad how cruel people can be.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this, when a lot of times it's just a way to vent some aggression on a person that you think of only as an abstraction.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So I think it's important for people to realize that whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you want to put out there, there's real people that can get hurt. You can really get people to one, be the worst version of themselves, or two, possibly take their own life, and it's not as real.<|eot_id|>"}

And for me, who deeply cares about education, higher education, thank you for holding the MITs and the Harvards accountable for doing right by the people that walk their halls. So thank you so much for talking today. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Greg Lukianoff. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Noam Chomsky, \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked, so was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.\" Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
