{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Ivanka Trump, businesswoman, real estate developer, and former senior advisor to the president of the United States. I've gotten to know Ivanka well over the past two years. We've become good friends, hitting it off right away over our mutual love of reading, especially philosophical writings from Marcus Aurelius, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Victor Franco, and so on. She is a truly kind, compassionate, and thoughtful human being. In the past, people have attacked her, in my view, to get indirectly at her dad, Donald Trump, as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism. These attacks obscured many projects and efforts, often bipartisan, that she helped get done, and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being. Through all that, she never returned the attacks with anything but kindness and always walked through the fire of it all with grace. For this, and much more, she is an inspiration and I'm honored to be able to call her a friend. Oh, and for those living in the United States, happy upcoming 4th of July. It's both an anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence and an anniversary of my immigrating here to the U.S. I'm forever grateful for this amazing country, for this amazing life, for all of you who have given a chance to a silly kid like me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ivanka Trump. You said that ever since you were young, you wanted to be a builder, that you loved the idea of designing beautiful city skylines, especially in New York City. I love the New York City skyline. So, describe the origins of that love of building.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>got older and as I got involved in real estate, I realized that it was so multidisciplinary. You have, of course, the design, but you also have engineering, the brass tacks of construction. There's time management, there's project planning. Just the duration of time to complete one of these iconic structures, it's enormous. You can contribute a decade of your life to one project. So, while you have to think big picture, it means you really have to care deeply about the details because you live with them. So, it allowed me to flex a lot of areas of interest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love that confidence of youth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's funny because we're all so insecure, right? In the most basic interactions, but yet, our ambitions are so unbridled in a way that kind of makes you blush as an adult. And I think it's fun. It's fun to tap into that energy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, where everything is possible. I think some of the greatest builders I've ever met, kind of always have that little flame of everything is possible, still burning. That is a silly notion from youth, but it's not so silly. Everybody tells you something is impossible, but if you continue believing that it's possible and to have that sort of naive notion that you could do it, even if it's exceptionally difficult, that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects ever done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Going out to space or building a new company where like everybody said, it's impossible, taking on that gigantic company and disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done, or doing huge building projects where, like you said, so many people are involved in making that happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We get conditioned out of that feeling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We start to become insecure, and we start to rely on the input or validation of others, and it takes us away from that core drive and ambition. So, it's fun to reflect on that and also to smile, right? Because whether you can execute or not, time will tell. But yeah, no, that was very much my childhood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course, it's important to also have the humility of once you get humbled and realize that it's actually a lot of work to build.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I still am amazed just looking at big buildings, big bridges, that human beings are able to get together and build those things. That's one of my favorite things about architecture is just like, wow. It's a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something epic, much bigger than themselves, and it's like a statue that represents that and it can be there for a long time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think, in some ways, you look out at different city skylines and it's almost like a visual depiction of ambition realized, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a testament to somebody's dream. Not somebody, a whole ensemble of people's dreams and visions and triumphs, and in some cases, failures, if the projects weren't properly executed. So, you look at these skylines, and it's a testament to that. I actually heard once architecture described as frozen music. That really resonated with me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love thinking about a city skyline as an ensemble of dreams realized.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I remember the first time I went to Dubai and I was watching them dredging out and creating these man-made islands. And I remember somebody once saying to me, they're an architect, an architect actually who collaborated with us on our tower in Chicago. He said that the only thing that limited what an architect could do in that area was gravity and imagination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but gravity is a tricky one to work against, and that's where civil engineer is one of my favorite things. I used to build bridges in high school for physics classes. You have to build bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative to their own weight. You study how good it is by finding its breaking point. And that was a deep appreciation for me, on a miniature scale of on a large scale, what people are able to do with civil engineering because gravity is a tricky one to fight against.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It definitely is. And bridges, I mean, some of the iconic designs in our country are incredible bridges.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, if we think of skylines as ensembles of dreams realized, you spent quite a bit of time in New York. What do you love about and what do you think about the New York City skyline? What's a good picture? We're looking here at a few. I mean, looking over the water.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work. And especially when a lot of those buildings were built, there was this incredible competition happening between New York and Chicago for kind of dominance of the sky and for who could create the greatest skyline, that sort of race to the sky when skyscrapers were first being built, starting in Chicago and then, New York surpassing that in terms of height, at least, with the Empire State Building. So, I love contextualizing the skylines as well, and thinking back to when different components that are so iconic were added and the context in which they came into being.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got to ask you about this. There's a pretty cool page that I've been following on X, Architecture & Tradition, and they celebrate traditional schools of architecture. And you mentioned Gothic, the tapestry. This is in Chicago, the Tribune Tower in Chicago. So, what do you think about that, the old and the new mixed together? Do you like Gothic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think it's hard to look at something like the Tribune Tower and not be completely in awe. This is an unbelievable building. Look at those buttresses and you've got gargoyles hanging off of it. And this style was reminiscent of the cathedrals of Europe, which was very in vogue in the 1920s here in America. Actually, I mentioned the Woolworth Tower before. The Woolworth Tower was actually referred to as the Cathedral of Commerce, because it also was in that Gothic style.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Amazing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's almost not replicable. It personally really resonates with me because one of the first projects I ever worked on was building Trump Chicago, which was this beautiful, elegant, super modern, all glass skyscraper, right across the way. So, it was right across the river. So, I would look out the windows as it was under construction, or be standing quite literally on rebar of the building, looking out at the Tribune and incredibly inspired. And now, the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river, but also the Tribune building and other buildings on Michigan Avenue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you like it when the reflective properties of the glass is part of the architecture?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of sort of a composition that comes together. I think in this case, the glass on Trump Chicago is very beautiful. It was designed by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, a major architecture firm who actually did the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is, I think, an awe-inspiring example of modern architecture. But glass is tricky. You have to get the shade right. Some glass has a lot of iron in it and gets super green, and that's a choice. And sometimes you have more blue properties, blue-silver, like you see here, but it's part of the character.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you know what it's actually going to look like when it's done? Is it possible to imagine that? Because it feels like there's so many variables.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it. So, you have to spend a lot of time with the actual materials, not just the beautiful artistic renderings, which can be incredibly misleading. The goal is actually that the end result is much, much more compelling than what the architect or artist rendered. But oftentimes, that's very much not the case. Sometimes also, you mentioned context, sometimes I'll see renderings of buildings, I'm like, wait, what about the building right to the left of it that's blocking 80% of its views of the ... Architects, they'll remove things that are inconvenient. So, you have to be rooted in-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In reality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In reality. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I love the notion of living with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of the drawings.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, both are probably important, because you have to dream the thing into existence, but you also have to be rooted in what the thing is actually going to look like in the context of everything else.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the underlying principles of the page I just mentioned, and I hear folks mention this a lot, is that modern architecture is kind of boring, that it lacks soul and beauty. And you just spoke with admiration for both modern and for Gothic, for older architecture. So, do you think there's truth that modern architecture is boring?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm living in Miami currently, so I see a lot of super uninspired glass boxes on the waterfront, but I think exceptional things shouldn't be the norm. They're typically rare. And I think in modern architecture, you find an abundance of amazing examples of super compelling and innovative building designs. I mean, I mentioned the Burj Khalifa. It is awe-inspiring. This is an unbelievably striking example of modern architecture. You look at some older examples, the Sydney Opera House. And so, I think there's unbelievable ... There you go. I mean, that's like a needle in the sky.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Reaching out to the stars.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on the most basic level. So, I think actually, it's a really, really exciting time for innovation in architecture. And I think there are some incredible examples of modern design that are really exciting. But generally, I think Roosevelt said that, \"Comparison is the thief of joy.\" So, it's hard. You look at the Tribune Building, you look at some of these iconic structures. One of the buildings I'm most proud to have worked on was the historical Old Post Office building in Washington D.C. You look at a building like that and it feels like it has no equal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also, there's a psychological element where people tend to want to complain about the new and celebrate the old.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Always. It's like the history of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just, people are always skeptical and concerned about change. And it's true that there's a lot of stuff that's new that's not good, it's not going to last, it's not going to stand the test of time, but some things will. And just like in modern art and modern music, there's going to be artists that stand the test of time and we'll later look back and celebrate them, \"Those were the good times.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you just step back, what do you love about architecture? Is it the beauty? Is it the function?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tell you that they got engaged in the lobby of your building or they got married in the ballroom, and share with you some of those experiences. So, to me, that's equally as beautiful, the use cases for these unbelievable projects. But I think it's all of it. I love that you've got the construction and you've got the design, and you've got then the interior design, and you've got the financing elements, the marketing elements, and it's all wrapped up in this one effort. So, to me, it's exciting to sort of flex in all of those different ways.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Like you said, it's dreams realized, hard work realized. I mean, probably on the bridge side is why I love the function. In terms of function being primary, you just think of the millions-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh my gosh, look at that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... bridges-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Go down. Look at that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. This is Devil's Bridge in Germany.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I wouldn't say it's the most practical design, but look how beautiful that is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, this is probably ... Well, we don't know. We need to interview some people whether the function holds up, but in terms of beauty, and then, what we're talking about, using the water for the reflection and the shape that it creates, I mean, there's an elegance to the shape of a bridge.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>See, it's interesting that they call it Devil's Bridge because to me, this is very ethereal. I think about the ring, the circle, life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's nothing about this that makes me feel ... Maybe they're just being ironic in the names.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Unless that function's really flawed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. Maybe-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Nobody's ever successfully crossed it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could cross the bridge. Yeah. But I mean, to me, there's just iconic ... I love looking at bridges because of the function. It's the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge. I mean, those are probably my favorites in the United States. Just in a city, to be able to look out and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge, and thinking of all the millions of cars that pass, the busyness, us humans getting together and going to work, building cool stuff. And just the bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it creates. It's cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the connectivity as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The network of roads all come together. So, there, the bridge is the ultimate combination of function and beauty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I remember when I was first learning about bridges, studying the cable stay versus the suspension bridge. And I mean, you actually built many replicas, so I'm sure you'll have a point of view on this, but they really are so beautiful. And you mentioned the Brooklyn Bridge, but growing up in New York, that was as much a part of the architectural story and tapestry of that skyline as any building that's seen in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What in general is your philosophy of design and building in architecture?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, some of the most recent projects I worked on prior to government service were the Old Post Office building and almost simultaneously, Trump Doral in Miami. So, these were both two just massive undertakings, both redevelopments, which in a lot of cases, having worked on ground-up construction redevelopment projects, are in a lot of ways much more complicated because you have existing attributes, but also a lot of limitations you have to work within, especially when you're repurposing a use. So, the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue was-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>would oversee every single decision we made. But in advance of even having the opportunity to do it, there was a close to two-year request for proposal, like a process that was put out by the General Services Administration. So, it was this really arduous government procurement process that we were competing against so many different people for the opportunity, which a lot of people said it was a gigantic waste of time. But I looked at that and I think so did a lot of the other bidders and say, \"It's worth trying to put the best vision forward.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you fell in love with this project? This-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I fell in love. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, is there some interesting details about what it takes to do renovation, about some of the challenges or opportunities? Because you want to maintain the beauty of the old and now upgrade the functionality, I guess, and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the building magical in the first place.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Office. But it required a level of precision. And I think in real estate, you have a lot of people who design on plan and a lot of people who are in the business of acquiring and flipping. So, it's more financial engineering than it is building. And they don't spend the time sweating these details that make something great and make something functional. And you feel it in the end result. But I mean, blood, sweat, tears, years of my life for those projects, and it was worth it. I enjoyed, almost, I enjoyed almost every minute of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, to you, it's not about the flipping, to you, it's about the art and the function of the thing that you're creating?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's design on plan? I'm learning new things today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>room was on a blueprint and then, I'd go to Washington and I'd walk that floor and I'd realize that there was a column that ran right up through the middle of the space where the bed was supposed to be, or the toilet was supposed to be, or the shower. So, there's a lot of things that are missed when you do something conceptually without rooting it in the actual structure. And that's why I think even with ground-up construction as well, people who aren't constantly on their job sites, constantly walking the projects, there's a lot that's missed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, there's a wisdom to the idea that we talked about before, live with the materials and walking the construction site, walking the rooms. I mean, that's what you hear from people like Steve Jobs, like Elon. That's why you live on the factory floor. That's why you constantly obsess about the details of the actual, not of the plans, but the physical reality of the product. I mean, the insanity of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive working together on making it perfect, making the iPhone, the early designs, prototypes, making that perfect, what it actually feels like in the hand. You have to be there as close to the metal as possible to truly understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And you have to love it in order to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. It shouldn't be about how much it's going to sell for and all that kind of stuff. You have to love the art.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Because for the most part, you can probably get 90, maybe even 95% of the end result, unless something has terribly gone awry, by not caring with that level of almost like maniacal precision. But you'll notice that 10% for the rest of your life. So, I think that extra effort, that passion, I think that's what separates good from great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we go back to that young Ivanka, the confidence of youth, and if we could talk about your mom. She had a big influence on you. You told me she was an adventurer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Olympic skier and a businesswoman. What did you learn about life from your mother?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>executive and builder. Just this all-around trailblazing businesswoman. I also learned from her, aside from that element, how to really enjoy life. I look back and some of my happiest memories of her are in the ocean- ... memories of her are in the ocean, just lying on our back, looking up at the sun and just so in the moment or dancing. She loved to dance, so she really taught me a lot about living life to its fullest. And she had so much courage, so much conviction, so much energy, and a complete comfort with who she was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about that? Olympic athlete. The trade-off between ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that, and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy every moment of life. That trade-off. What do you think about that trade-off?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>made her value those moments more as an adult. I think she was a great balance of the two that we all hope to find, and she was able to find both incredibly serious and formidable. I remember as a little girl, I used to literally traipse behind her at the Plaza Hotel, which she oversaw and actually was her old post office. It was this unbelievable historic hotel in New York City, and I'd follow her around at construction meetings and on job sites. And there she is, dancing. See? That's funny that that's the picture you pull up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sorry. The two of you just look great in that picture.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's great. She had such a joy to her and she was so unabashed in her perspective and her opinions. She made my father look reserved, so whatever she was feeling, she was just very expressive and a lot of fun to be around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So she, as you mentioned, grew up during the Prague Spring in 1968, and that had a big impact on human history. My family came from the Soviet Union. And then the story of the 20th century is a lot of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, tried the ideas of communism, and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering. So why do you think the communist ideology failed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>As a young girl, she was on the junior national Ski team for Czechoslovakia. My grandfather used to train her. They used to put the skis on her back and walk up the mountain in Czechoslovakia because there were no ski lifts. She actually made me do that when I was a child just to let me know what her experience had been. If I complained that it was cold out, she's like, \"Well, you didn't have to walk up the mountain. You'd be plenty warm if you had carried the skis up on your back, up the last run.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel like they made people tougher back then, like my grandma. And you mentioned, it's funny, they go through some of the darkest things that a human being can go through and they don't talk about it, and they have a general positive outlook on life that's deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be. How bad it could get. My grandma survived Holodomor in Ukraine, which was a mass starvation brought on by the collectivist policies of the Stalin regime, and then she survived the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Never talked about it. Probably went through extremely dark, extremely difficult times, and then just always had a positive outlook on life. And also made me do very difficult physical activity, as you mentioned, just to humble you. Kids these days are soft kind of energy, which I'm deeply, deeply grateful for on all fronts, including just having hardship and including just physical hardship flung at me. I think that's really important.<|eot_id|>"}

And she told me that eventually all those local police officers, they came to love her because one of the things she'd do is smuggle stuff back from these countries and give it to them to give their wives perfume and stockings. So she figured out the system pretty quickly, but it's a very different experience from what I was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a 14-year-old was dealing with, so I have so much respect and admiration for her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, hardship clarifies what's important in life. You and I have talked about Man's Search for Meaning, that book. Having an ultimate hardship clarifies that finding joy in life is not about the environment, it's about your outlook on that environment. And there's beauty to be found in any situation. And also, in that particular situation, when everything is taken from you, the thing you start to think about is the people you love. So in the case of Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl thinking about his wife and how much he loves her, and that love was the flame, the warmth that kept him excited. The fun thing to think about when everything else is gone. So we sometimes forget that with the busyness of life, you get all this fun stuff we're talking about like building and being a creative force in the world. At the end of the day, what matters is just the other humans in your life, the people you love.<|eot_id|>"}

And I think what he showed is that we can cultivate these virtues within ourselves regardless of the situation we find ourselves in. And in some ways, I think the meaning of life is the search for meaning in life. It's the relationships we have and we form. It's the experience we have. It's how we deal with the suffering that life inevitably presents to us. And Viktor Frankl does an amazing job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances, and I think it's just super inspiring to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He also shows that you can get so much from just small joys, like getting a little more soup today than you did yesterday. It's the little stuff. If you allow yourself to love the little stuff of life, it's all around you. It's all there. So you don't need to have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy, that kind of stuff. It's all around us. The ability to eat. When I was in the jungle and I got severely dehydrated, because there's no water, you run out of water real quick. And the joy I felt when I got to drink. I didn't care about anything else.

But I would see him do that on a lot of different issues. He would ask people on the work level what their thoughts were. Ideas, concepts, designs. And there was almost like a Socratic first principles type of way he questioned people, trying to get down to trying to reduce complex things to something really fundamental and simple. So I try to do that myself to the best I can, and I think it's something I very much learned from him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've seen great engineers, great leaders do just that. You see, you want to do that a lot, which is basically ask questions to push simplification. Can we do this simpler? The basic question is, \"Why are we doing it this way? Can this be done simpler?\" And not taking as an answer that this is how we've always done it. It doesn't matter that's how we've always done it. What is the right way to do it? And usually, the simpler it is, the more correct the way. It has to do with costs, has to do with simplicity of production, manufacture, but usually simple is best.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And it's oftentimes not the architecture or the engineers. It's in Elon's case probably the line worker who sees things more clearly. So I think making sure it's not just that you're asking good questions, you're asking the right people those same good questions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why a lot of the Elon companies are really flat in terms of organizational design, where anybody on the factory floor can talk directly to Elon. There's not this managerial class, this hierarchy, where [inaudible 00:58:16] have to travel up and down the hierarchy, which large companies often construct this hierarchy of managers where no one manager, if you ask them the question of what have you done this week, the answer is really hard to come up with. Usually, it's going to be a bunch of paperwork, so nobody knows what they're actually do. So when it's flat, you can actually get as quickly as possible with when problems arise, you can solve those problems as quickly as possible. And also, you have a direct, rapid, iterative process where you're making things simpler, making them more efficient, and constantly improving. Yeah. It's interesting. You see this in government. A lot of people get together, a hierarchy is developed, and sometimes it's good, but very often just slows things down. And you see great companies, great, great companies, Apple, Google, Meta, they have to fight against that bureaucracy that builds, the slowness that large organizations have. And to still be a big organization and act like a startup is the big challenge.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's super difficult to deconstruct that as well once it's in place. It's circumventing layers and asking questions, probing questions, of people on the ground level is a huge challenge to the authority of the hierarchy. And there's tremendous amount of resistance to it. So it's how do you grow something, in the case of a company, in terms of a culture that can scale but doesn't lose its connection to real and meaningful feedback? It's not easy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've had a lot of conversations with Jim Keller, who's this legendary engineer and leader, and he has talked about you often have to be a little bit of an asshole in the room. Not in a mean way, but it is uncomfortable. A lot of these questions, they're uncomfortable. They break the general politeness and civility that people have in communication. When you get a meeting, nobody wants to be like, \"Can we do it way different?\" Everyone wants to just like, \"This lunch is coming up, I have this trip planned on the weekend with the family.\" Everyone just wants comfort. When humans get together, they gravitate towards comfort. Nobody wants that one person that comes in and says, \"Hey, can we do this way better and way different, and everything we've gotten comfortable with, throw it out?\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not only do they not want that, but the one person who comes in and does that puts a massive target on their back and is ultimately seen as a threat. Nobody really gets fired for maintaining the status quo, even if things go poorly. It's the way it was always done.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, humans are fascinating.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And really have that first principles type of orientation, especially in those large bureaucratic contexts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So amongst many other things, you created a fashion brand.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Saks to Bloomingdale's and beyond. And I think it really resonated with people in an amazing way and probably not dissimilar to how I have this incredible experience every time somebody comes up to me and tells me that they were married in a space that I had painstakingly designed, I have that experience now with my fashion company. The number of women who will come up tell me that they loved my shoes or they loved the handbags, and I've had women show me their engagement rings. They got engaged with us and it's really rewarding. It's really beautiful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When I was hanging out with you in Miami, the number of women that came up to you saying they love the clothing, they love the shoes is awesome.<|eot_id|>"}

And then you overlay that with great design and we also created this really comfortable, beautifully designed, super feminine product offering that was also affordably priced. So I think it was the trifecta of those three things that I think it made it stand out for so many people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know if it's possible to articulate, but can you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing, what you go through to bring an idea to life?<|eot_id|>"}

But I always wanted to bring the best talent in. So I was hiring great designers and printmakers and copywriters. And so I had this almost like... That conductor analogy. I had this incredible group of, in this case, women assembled who had very strong points of view themselves and it created a great team.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So yeah, I mean, great team is really sort of essential.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But there's this thing of taste, which is really interesting because it's hard to articulate what it takes, but basically knowing A versus B what looks good. Or without A-B comparison to say, \"If we changed this part, that would make it better.\" That sort of designer taste, that's hard to make explicit what that is, but the great designers have that taste, like, \"This is going to look good.\" And it's not actually... Again, the Steve Jobs thing, it's not the opinion poll. You can't poll people and ask them what looks better. You have to have the vision of that. And as you said, you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your taste is good, such that you can curate, you can direct teams. You can argue that no, no, no, this is right. Even when there's several people that say, \"This doesn't make any sense.\" If you have that vision, have the confidence, this will look good. That's how you come up with great designs. It's a mixture of great tastes as do develop over time and the confidence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>love most about all of these creative pursuits is that ability to work with the best people. Right now I'm working with my husband. We have this 1400 acre island in the Mediterranean and we're bringing in the best architects and the best brands. But to have a point of view and to challenge people who are such artists respectfully, but not to be afraid to ask questions, it takes a lot of confidence to do that. And it's hard. So these are actually just internal early renderings. So we're in the process of doing the master planning now, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is beautiful.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it. And it may not be this. This is sort of, as I said, early conceptual drawings, but it gives a sense of wanting to honor the topography that exists. And this is obviously very modern, but making it feel right in terms of the context of the vegetation and the terrain that exists is, and not just have a beautiful glass box. Obviously you want glass. You want to look out and see that gorgeous blue ocean, but how do you do that in a way that doesn't feel generic and isn't a squandered opportunity to create something new?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And it's integrated with a natural landscape. It's a celebration of the natural landscape around it. So I guess you start from this dream-like... Because this feels like a dream. And then when you're faced with the reality of the building materials and all the actual constraints of the building, then it evolves from there, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And I mean so much of architecture you don't see, but it's decisions made. So how do you create independent structures where you look out of one and don't see the other? How do you ensure the stacking and the master plan works in a way that's harmonious and view corridors? And all of those elements, all of those components of decision-making are super appreciated, but not often thought about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's a view corridor?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To make sure that the top unit, you're not looking out and seeing a whole bunch of units, you're looking out and seeing the ocean. So that's where you take this and then you start angling everything and you start thinking about, \"Well, in this context, do we have green roofs?\" If there's any hint of a roof, it's camouflaged by vegetation that matches what already exists on the island. That's where the engineers become very important. How do you build into a mountainside while being sensitive to the beauty of the island?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's almost like a mathematical problem. I took a class, computational geometry in grad school, where you have to think about these view corridors. It's like a math problem, but it's also an art problem because it's not just about making sure that there's no occlusions to the view. You have to figure out when there is occlusions, what is a vegetation. So you have to figure all that out. And there's probably... So every single room, every single building is a thing that adds extra complexity.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>how does the sun rise and set? So how do you want to angle the hotel in relation to the sunrise and the sunset? You obviously want people to experience those. So which do you favor the directionality of the wind and on an island, and in this case, the wind's coming from the north and the vegetation is less lush on the northern end. So do you focus more on the southern end and have the horseback riding trails and amenities up towards the north? So there are these really interesting decisions and choices you get to reflect on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a fascinating sort of discussion to be having. And probably there's actual constraints on infrastructure issues. So all of those are constraints.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the grade of the land, if it's super steep. So also finding the areas of topography that are flatter but still have the great views. So it's fun. I think real estate and building, it's like a giant puzzle. And I love puzzles.

And that's a really interesting... How texture matters, how color matters. And I think oftentimes interior design is not... It doesn't take the same priority.

I don't know how much you've looked into robots, but there's a way to communicate love and affection from a robot that I'm really fascinated by. And a lot of cartoonists do this too. When you create cartoons and non-human-like entities, you have to bring out the joy.

Just the recognizing you and catching your eye and just showing his excitement by wiggling his butt and tail and all this intense joy that overtakes his body, that moment of recognizing something. It's the double take, that moment of where this joy of recognition takes over your whole cognition and you're just there and there's a connection. And then the other person gets excited and you both get excited together. It's kind of like that feeling... How would I put it? When you go to airports and you get to see people who haven't seen each other for a time all of a sudden recognize each other in their meeting and they're all run towards each other in a hug? That moment. By the way, that's awesome to watch. There's so much joy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you come back and your dog sees you like it's the first time. So I love replicating that in robots. They actually say children... One of the reasons why Peek-A-Boo is so successful is that they actually don't remember not having seen you a few seconds prior. There's a term for it, but I remember when my kids were younger, you leave the room and you walk back in 30 seconds later and they experienced the same joy as if you had been gone for four hours. And we grow out of that. We become very used to one another.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I kind of want to forever be excited by the Peek-A-Boo phenomena, the simple joys. We're talking about on fashion, having the confidence of taste to be able to sort of push through on this idea of a design. But you've also mentioned somebody you admire is Rick Rubin in his book, The Creative Act. It has some really interesting ideas, and one of them is to accept self-doubt and imperfection. So is there some battle within yourself that you have on sort of striving for perfection and for the confidence and always kind of having it together versus accepting that things are always going to be imperfect?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of my comfort zone. So I think that's always lived with me, and I think it probably always will. I think you have to have humility in anything you do that you could be better and strive for that. I think as you get older, it softens a little bit as you have more reps, as you have more examples of having been thrown in the deep end and figured out how to swim. You get a little bit more comfortable in your abstract competency. But if that fear is not in you, I think you're not challenging yourself enough.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Harness the fear. The other thing he writes about is intuition, that you need to trust your instincts and intuition. That's a very recruitment thing to say. So what percent of your decision making is intuition or what percent is through rigorous careful analysis, would you say?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>personal level, if you're acting in accordance with your core values, it just feels good. And even if it would be the right decision for others, if you're acting outside of your integrity or core values, it doesn't feel good and your intuition will signal that to you. You'll never be comfortable. So I think because of that, I start oftentimes with my intuition and then I put it through a rigorous test of whether that is in fact true. But very seldom do I go against what my initial instinct was, at least at this point in my life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I had actually a discussion yesterday with a big time business owner investor who's talking about being impulsive and following that on a phone call, shifting the entire everything... Giving away a very large amount of money and moving it in another direction on an impulse. Making a promise that he can't at that time deliver, but knows if he works hard, he'll deliver and all... Just following that impulsive feeling. And he said now that he has a family, that probably some of that impulse is quieted down a little bit. He's more rational and thoughtful and so on, but wonders whether it's sometimes good to just be impulsive and to just trust your gut and just go with it. Don't deliberate too long because then you won't do it. It's interesting. It's the confidence and stupidity maybe of youth that leads to some the greatest breakthroughs, and there's a cost to wisdom and deliberation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is. But I actually think in this case, as you get older, you may act less impulsively, but I think you're more like attuned with... You have more experience, so your gut is more well honed. So your instincts are more well honed. I think I found that to be true for me. It doesn't feel as reckless as when I was younger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Amongst many other things. You were on The Apprentice. People love you on there.

In the lobby of Trump Tower, that's where the war rooms and boardrooms of the candidates were, the contestants were. And then we would go up in the elevator to our office. We would work all day, and then we'd come down and we'd evaluate the task. It was this weird real life television thing experience in the middle of our... Sort of on the bookends of our work day.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Like my father was.

And I think there are a lot of performers like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I just in general love to see people that have found the thing that makes them come alive. I, as I mentioned, went to the jungle recently with Paul Rosolie, and he's a guy who just belongs in the jungle. That's a guy where when I got a chance to go with him from the city to the jungle, and you just see this person change, of the happiness, the joy he has when he first is able to jump in the water of Amazon River and to feel like he's home with the crocodiles, and all that, with his calling friends and probably dances around in the trees with the monkeys. So this is where he belongs, and I love seeing that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You felt that. I mean, I watched the interview you did with him and he felt that his passion and enthusiasm, it radiated. And I mean, I love animals. I love all animals. Never loved snakes so much. And he almost made me, now I appreciate the beauty of them much more than I did prior to listening to him speak about them. But it's an infectious thing. He actually, we were talking about skyscrapers before. I loved it. He called trees skyscrapers of life, and I thought that was so great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and they are. They're so big. Just like skyscrapers or large buildings, they also represent a history, especially in Europe. I like to think, looking at all these ancient buildings, you like to think of all the people throughout history that have looked at them, have admired them, have been inspired by them. The great leaders of history. In France it's like Napoleon, just the history that's contained within a building, you almost feel the energy of that history. You can feel the stories emanate from the buildings. And that same way when you look at giant trees that have been there for decades, for centuries in some cases, you feel the history, the stories emanate. I got a chance to climb some of them, so you feel like there's a visceral feeling of the power of the trees. It's cool.<|eot_id|>"}

That's an experience I'd love to have, be that disconnected.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Being in the jungle among the trees, among the animals, you remember that you're forever a part of nature. You're fundamentally our nature, Earth is a living organism and you're a part of that organism. And that's humbling, that's beautiful, and you get to experience that in a real, real way. It sounds simple to say, but when you actually experience it stays with you for a long time. Especially if you're out there alone. I got a chance to spend time in the jungle solo, just by myself. And you sit in the fear of that, in the simplicity of that, all of it, and just no sounds of humans anywhere. You're just sitting there and listening to all the monkeys and the birds trying to have sex with each other, all around you just screaming. And I mean, I romanticize everything, there's birds that are monogamous for life, like macaws, you could see two of them flying. They're also, by the way, screaming at each other.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's really funny, because there aren't that many animal species that are monogamous.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and we feel sort of so consequential in the context of even our own lives.

And I feel that way when I'm on the ocean on a surfboard. It's really humbling to be so small amidst that vast sea. And it feels really beautiful with no noise, no chatter, no distractions, just being in the moment. And it sounds like you experienced that in a very, very real way in the Amazon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the power of the waves is cool.

And I think in surfing, one of the things I love about it is I feel like a lot of water sports you're manipulating the environment. And there's something that can be a little violent about it, like you look at windsurfing. Whereas with surfing, you're in harmony with it. So you're not fighting it, you're flowing with it. And you still have the agency of choosing which waves you're going to surf, and you sit there and you read the ocean and you learn to understand it, but you can't control it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's it like to fall in your face when you're trying to surf?

You just have to flow with it until inevitably there's a break and then paddle like hell back out to the line, or to the beach, whatever you're feeling.

So you learn so much about what motivates people, what drives people, what their concerns are, and you grow so much as a result of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you're in the White House, people, unlike in any other position, people have a sense that all the troubles they're going through, maybe you can help, so they put it all out there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>raw, vulnerable, and real way. It's shocking and eyeopening and super motivating. I remember once I was in New Hampshire, and early on, right after my father had announced his candidacy, and a man walks up to me in the greeting line and within around five seconds he had started to tell me a story about how his daughter had died of an overdose, and how he was worried his son was also addicted to opioids, his daughter's friends, his son's friends. And it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking, and it's something that I would experience every day in talking with people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And those stories just stay with you.<|eot_id|>"}

And you can get these stories when you go to a bar in the middle of nowhere and just sit and talk to people and they start sharing. And it reminds you of how beautiful the country is. It reminds you of several things. One, that people, well, it shows you that there's a lot of different accents, that's for one. But aside from that, that people are struggling with all the same stuff. And at least at that time, I wonder what it is now, but at that time, I don't remember. On the surface, there's political divisions, there's Republicans and Democrats, and so on, but underneath it people were all the same. The concerns were all the same, there was not that much of a division. Right now, the surface division has been amplified even more maybe because of social media, I don't know why. So, I would love to see what the country's like now. But I suspect probably it's still not as divided as it appears to be on the surface, what the media shows, what the social media shows. But what did you experience in terms of the division?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's always been incredibly vicious. I think in the toxic swirl of social media it's more amplified, and there's more democratization around participating in it perhaps, and it seems like the voices are louder, but it feels like it's always been that. But I don't believe most people are like that. And you meet people along the way and they're not leading with what their politics are. They're telling you about their hopes for themselves and their communities. And it makes you feel that we are a whole lot less divided than the media and others would have us believe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Although, I have to say, having duals sounds pretty cool. Maybe I just romanticize westerns, but anyway. All right, I miss Clint Eastwood movies. Okay. But it's true. You read some of this stuff in terms of what politics used to be in the history of the United States. Those folks went pretty rough, way rougher, actually. But they didn't have social media, so they had to go real hard. And the media was rough too. So all the fake news, all of that, that's not recent. It's been nonstop. I look at the surface division, the surface bickering, and that might be just a feature of democracy. It's not a bug of democracy, it's a feature. We're in a constant conflict, and it's the way we resolve, we try to figure out the right way forward. So in the moment, it feels like people are just tearing each other apart, but really we're trying to find a way, where in the long arc of history it will look like progress. But in the short term, it just sounds like people making stories up about other and calling each other names, and all this kind of stuff, but there's a purpose to it. I mean, that's what freedom looks like, I guess is what I'm trying to say, and it's better than the alternative.<|eot_id|>"}

So you hear stories like that, and then you get asked, \"Will you come with me?\" And it's really hard to say no. I spent four years in Washington. I feel like I left it all in the field. I feel really good about it, and I feel really privileged to have been able to do what I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A chance to help many people.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>after meeting with lawmakers, convincing them of why this is good policy, going into their districts, campaigning in their districts, helping them convince their constituents of why it's important, of why childcare support is important, of why paid family leave is important, of different policies that impact working American families. So it's hard, but it's really rewarding. And then to get it done, I mean, just the child tax credit alone, 40 million American families got an average of $2,200 each year as a result of the doubling of the child tax credits. That was one component of tax cuts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When I was researching this stuff, you just get to think the scale of things. The scale of impact is 40 million families, each one of those is a story, is a story of struggle, of trying to give a large part of your life to a job while still being able to give love and support and care to a family, to kids, and to manage all of that. Each one of those is a little puzzle that they have to solve. And it's a life and death puzzle. You can lose your home, your security, you can lose your job, you can screw stuff up with parenting, so you can mess all of that up and you're trying to hold it together, and government policies can help make that easier, or can in some cases make that possible. And you get to do that a scale out of five or 10 families, but 40 million families. And that's just one thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And her center was so successful because in part of different policies we worked on, including the childcare block grants that went to the state. She ended up opening additional centers, I visited her at one of them in Colorado. Now she has a huge focus on helping teenage moms who don't have the resources to afford quality childcare for their kids come into her centers and programs. And it's stories like that of the hardships people face, but also what they do with opportunity when they're given it, that really powers you through tough moments when you're in Washington.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What can you say about the process of bringing that to life? So, the child tax credits, so doubling them from a $1,000, $2,000 per child, what are the challenges of that? Getting people to compromise? I'm sure there's a lot of politicians playing games with that because maybe it's a Republican that came up with an idea or a Democrat that came up with an idea, and so they don't want to give credit to the idea. And there's probably all kinds of games happening where when the game is happening, you probably forget about the families. Each politician thinks about how they can benefit themselves, if you get the serving part of the role you're supposed to be in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There were definitely people I met with in Washington who I felt that was true of. But they all go back to their districts and I assume that they all have similar experiences to what I had, where people share their stories. So there'd be something really cynical about thinking they forget, but some do.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You helped get people together. What's that take? Trying to people to compromise, trying to get people to see the common humanity?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in hopes that one day they would have the votes to get exactly what they want. But I was surprised by how little discussion there was. So I think part of it is be willing to have those tough discussions with people who may not share your viewpoint and be an active listener when they point out flaws and they have suggestions for changes, not believing that you have a monopoly on good ideas. And I think there has to be a lot of humility in architecting these things. And a policy should benefit from that type of well-rounded input.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Be able to see, like you said, well-designed policies. There's probably the details are important too. Just like with architecture and you walk the rooms, there's probably really good designs of policies, economic policy that helps families that delivers the maximum amount of money or resources to families that need it and is not a waste of money. So there's probably really nice designs there and nice ideas that are bipartisan that has nothing to do with politics, has to do with just great economic policy, just great policies. And that requires listening.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Requires trust, too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Trust.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that policy. I really figured out who was willing to deviate from their talking points when the door was closed and who wasn't. And it takes some courage to do that, especially without surety that it would actually get done, especially if they've campaigned on something that was slightly different. And not everyone has that courage. So through tax cuts, I learned the people who did have that courage and I went back to that, well time and time again on policies that I thought were important, some were bipartisan. The Great American Outdoors Act is something, it's incredible policy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love that one.<|eot_id|>"}

So galvanizing the private sector to join us in that effort. So whether it's the legislative side, like the actual legislation of Perkins CTE, which was focused on vocational education or whether it's the ability to use the White House to galvanize the private sector, we got over 16 million commitments from the private sector to retrain or re-skill workers into the jobs of tomorrow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's so many aspects of education that you helped on, access to STEM and computer science education. So the CTE thing, you're mentioning modernizing career and technical education. And that's millions, millions of people. The act provided nearly $1.3 billion annually to more than 13 million students to better align the employer needs and all that kind of stuff. Very large scale policies that help a lot of people.

It's something that you may experience at far-flung destinations across the world, but it's happening there and it's happening here as well. And so through a coalition of people that on both sides of the aisle that I came to trust and to work well with, we were able to get legislation which the president signed, passed nine pieces of legislation, combating trafficking at home and abroad and digital exploitation of children.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much of a toll does that take seeing all the problems in the world at such a large scale, the immensity of it all? Was that hard to walk around with that just knowing how much suffering there is in the world? As you're trying to help all of it, as you're trying to design government policies to help all of that, it's also a very visceral recognition that there is suffering in the world.

But even helping families try to stay afloat, trying to break out or escape poverty, all of that, you get to see those stories of struggle. It's not easy. But the people that really feel the humanity of that, feel the pain of that are probably the right people to be politicians. But it's probably also why you can't stay in there too long.<|eot_id|>"}

We were able to shelter and protect them and allow them to have as normal as upbringing as was possible in the context we were living. And they brought me and continue to bring me so much, so much joy.

He's like, \"Mom, just experience it.\" I'm like, \"Yes, you're right Joseph, just experience it.\" So those kids have taught me so much about sort of reconnecting with what's real and what's true and being present in the moment and experiencing joy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>They always give you permission to sort of reignite the inner child to be a kid again. Yeah. And it's interesting what you said that the puzzle of noticing each human being, what makes them beautiful, the unique characteristics, what they're good at, the way they want to be mentored. I often see that, especially with coaches and athletes, young athletes aspiring to be great. Each athlete needs to be trained in a different way. For example, with some, you need a softer approach. With me, I always like a dictatorial approach. I like the coach to be this menacing figure. That's what brought out the best in me. I didn't want to be friends with the coach. I wanted almost, it's weird to say, but yelled at to be pushed. But that doesn't work for everybody. And that's a risk you have to take in the coach context of, because you can't just yell at everybody. You have to figure out what does each person need. And when you have kids, I imagine the puzzle is even harder.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you just plop down on the floor and start playing magnet tiles and that's where they need you. So those of us who have sort of alpha personalities who sometimes it's just witness, witness what they need. Play with them and allow them to lead the play. Don't force them down a road you may think is more interesting or productive or educational or edifying. Just be with them, observe them, and then show them that you are genuinely curious about the things that they are genuinely curious about.

I was talking to a friend yesterday and she has four kids and they fight a lot and she generally wants to break up the fights, but she's like, \"I'm not sure if I'm just supposed to let them fight. Can they figure it out?\" But you always break them up because I'm told that it's okay for them to fight. Kids do that. They kind of figure out their own situation. That's part of the growing up process. But you want to always, especially if it's physical, they're pushing each other. You want to kind of stop it. But at the same time, it's also part of the play, part of the dynamics. And that's a puzzle you also have to figure out.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>each other in a way that all kids do and we start to project into the future and catastrophize. If my two sons are going through a moment where they're like oil and water, anything one wants to do the other doesn't want to do. It's a very interesting moment. So my instinct is they're not going to like each other when they're 25. You sort of project into the future as opposed to recognizing this is a stage that I too went through, and it's normal, and it's not building it in your mind into something that's unnecessarily consequential.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's short-term formative conflict.<|eot_id|>"}

How do you walk through the fire of that? You've been very stoic about the whole thing. I don't think I've ever seen you respond to an attack. You just let it pass over you. You stay positive and you focus on solving problems and you didn't engage. While being in DC you didn't engage into the back and forth fire of the politics. So what's your philosophy behind that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>concept with my kids a lot, and I'm not willing to pay the price of that fleeting and momentary satisfaction of sort of swinging back because I think it would be too expensive for my soul. And that's how I made peace with it, because I think that feels more true for me. But it is a little bit contrary in politics. It's definitely a contrarian viewpoint to not get into the fray. Actually, some day, I love Dolly Parton says that she doesn't condemn or criticize. She loves and accepts. And I like that. It feels right for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I also like that you said that words have power. Sometimes people say, \"Well, words, when you speak negatively of others, ah, that's just words.\" But I think there's a cost to that. There's a cost, like you said, to your soul, and there's a cost in terms of the damage it can do to the other person, whether it's to their reputation publicly or to them privately. It just as a human being psychologically. And in the place that it puts them because they they start thinking negatively in general and then maybe they respond and there's this vicious downward spiral that happens, that almost like we don't intend to, but it destroys everybody in the process. You quoted Alan Watts, I love him, in saying, \"You're under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago.\" So how have the years in DC and the years after changed you?<|eot_id|>"}

And I think that's where my kids have been my teachers just being fully present and enjoying the little moments. And it doesn't mean I'm any less driven than I was before. It's just more a part of me than being sort of the all-consuming energy one has in their 20s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just like you said, with your mom be able to let go and enjoy the water, the sun, the beach, and enjoy the moment, the simplicity of the moment.<|eot_id|>"}

I mean, you mentioned also there, I've seen commutations where it's an opportunity to step in and consider the ways that the justice system does not always work well like in cases when it's nonviolent crime and drug offenses, there's a case of a person you mentioned that received a life sentence for selling weed. And it's just the number... It's like hundreds of thousands of people are in the federal prison, in jail, in the system for selling drugs. That's the only thing. With no violence on their record whatsoever. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity. There's the details matter, but oftentimes, the justice system does not do right in the way we think right is, and it's nice to be able to step in and help people indirectly.<|eot_id|>"}

But you see with Alice, the ripple effect of the commutation granted to her and her ability and the impact she'll have within her family, with her grandkids. And now, she's an advocate for so many others who are voiceless. It felt like the perfect way to end four years, to be able to call those parents and call those kids in some cases and give them the news that a loved one was coming home.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I just love the cool image of you, Kim Kardashian, and Alice just dancing on Adele's show with the kids. I love it.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She had connected us. It was beautiful. It was really beautiful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way Adele can hold just the badassness she has on stage, she does heartbreak songs better than anyone. Or no, it's not even heartbreak. What's that genre of song, like Rolling in the Deep, like a little anger, a little love, a little something, a little attitude, and just one of the greatest voices ever. All that together just her by herself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you can strip it down and the power of her voice. I think about that. One of the things we were talking about live music, one of the amazing things now is there's so much incredible concert material that's been uploaded to YouTube. So sometimes I just sit there and watch these old shows. We both love Stevie Ray Vaughan, like watching him perform. You can even find old videos of Django Reinhardt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got me.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I got you-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Stevie Ray Vaughan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Texas Flood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We had this moment, which is hilarious that you said one of the songs you really like of Stevie's is Texas Flood.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, my bucket list is to learn how to play it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a bucket list. This is a bucket list item. You made me feel so good because for me, Texas Flood was the first solo on guitar I've ever learned because for me, it was the impossible solo. And then so I worked really hard to learn it. It's like one of the most iconic sort of blues songs, Texas blues songs. And now, you made me fall in love with the song again and want to play it out live, at the very least, put it up on YouTube because it's so fun to improvise. And when you lose yourself in the song, it truly is a blues song. You can have fun with it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I hope you do do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Throw on a Stevie Ray Vaughan-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Regardless, I want you to play it for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>100%. 100%.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But he's amazing. And there's so many great performers that are playing live now. I just saw Chris Stapleton's show. He's an amazing country artist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's too good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's so good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That guy is so good.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Lukas Nelson's-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Lukas Nelson's amazing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a year. I mean, I should have chosen a different song, but Ou es-tu mon amour?, one of his songs, was... And it was like finger style and I was just going through and grinding it out. And that's kind of how I started to learn to play, by playing that song. But to see these old videos of him playing without all his fingers and the skill and the dexterity, one of my favorite live performances is actually who really influenced Adele is Aretha Franklin. And she did a version of Amazing Grace. Have you ever seen this video?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I cry. Look up... It was in LA. It was like the Temple Missionary Baptist Church. Talk about stripped down. She's literally a... I mean, just listen to this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you could do one note and you could just kill it. The pain, the soulfulness.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The spirit you feel in her when you watch this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's true. Adele carries some of that spirit also. Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. And you can take away all the instruments with Adele and just have that voice and it's so commanding and it's so... Anyway, you watch this and you see the arc of also the experience of the people in the choir and them starting to join in. And anyway, it's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love watching Queen, like Freddie Mercury, Queen performances in terms of vocalists and just great stage presence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That Live Aid performance is considered one of the best of all, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've watched that so many times. He's so cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Can we pull up that for a second? Go to that part where he's singing Radio Ga Ga and they're all mimicking in his arm movements. It's so cool. Radio ga ga. All we hear is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Look at that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Radio ga ga.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, man. I miss that guy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's an example of a person that was born to be on stage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So good. Well, we were talking surfing, we were talking jiu-jitsu. I think live music is one of those kind of rare moments where you can really be present, where something about the anticipation of choosing what show you're going to go to and then waiting for the date to come. And normally, it happens in the context of community. You go with friends and then allowing yourself to sort of fall into it is incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've been training jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Trying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, I've seen you do jiu-jitsu. You're very athletic. You know how to use your body to commit violence. Maybe there's better ways of phrasing that, but anyway-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's been a skill that's been honed over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, what do you like about jiu-jitsu?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>around for people who I could work with in Miami, and they recommended the Valente Brothers' studio. And you've met all three of them now. They're these remarkable human beings, and they've been so wonderful for our family. I mean, first, starting with Arabella, I used to take her and then she'd kind of encouraged me and she'd sort of pull me into it and I started doing it with her. And then Joseph and Theo saw us doing it, they wanted to start doing it. So now they joined and then Jared joined. So now, we're all doing jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>aware of the broader context of what's happening around you, which is really healthy and good as well. But it's been beautiful. Actually, the Valente Brothers, they have this 753code that was developed with some of the samurai principles in mind. And all of my kids have memorized it and they'll talk to me about it. Theo, he's eight years old, he's able to recite all 15. So benevolence and fitness and nutrition and flow and awareness and balance. And it's an unbelievable thing. And they'll actually integrate it into conversations where they'll talk about something that... Yeah, rectitude, courage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty. So this is not about jiu-jitsu techniques or fighting techniques. This is about a way of life, about the way you interact with the world with other people. Exercise, nutrition, rest, hygiene, positivity, that's more on the physical side of things. Awareness, balance, and flow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>soul, effectively, is how they break it out. And the kids can only advance and get their stripes if they really internalize this, they give examples of each of them. And my own kids will come home from school and they'll tell me examples of how things happened that weren't aligned with the 753code. So it's a framework much like religion is in our house and can be for others. It's a framework to discuss things that happen in their life, large and small, and has been beautiful. So I do think that body-mind connection is super strong in jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's many things I love about the Valente Brothers, but one of them is the how rooted it is in philosophy and history of martial arts in general. A lot of places, you'll practice the sport of it, maybe the art of it, but to recognize the history and what it means to be a martial artist broadly on and off the mat, that's really great. And the other thing that's great is they also don't forget the self-defense root, the actual fighting roots. So it's not just a sport, it's a way to defend yourself on the street in all situations. And that gives you a confidence in, just like you said, an awareness about your own body and awareness about others. Sadly, we forget, but it's a world full of violence or the capacity for violence. So it's good to have an awareness of that and the confidence how to essentially avoid it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>100%. I've seen it with all of my kids and myself, how much they've benefited from it. But that self-defense component and the philosophical elements of... Pedro will often tell them about wuwei and sort of soft resistance and some of these sort of more eastern philosophies that they get exposed to through their practice there that are sort of non-resistance, that are beautiful and hard concepts to internalize as an adult, but especially when you're 12, 10, and 8 respectively. So it's been an amazing experience for us all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love people like Pedro because he's finding books that are in Japanese and translating them to try to figure out the details of a particular history. He's an ultra scholar of martial arts, and I love that. I love when people give everything, every part of themselves to the thing they're practicing. People have been fighting each other for a very long time. From the Colosseum on. You can't fake anything. You can't lie about anything. It's truly honest. You're there and you either win or lose. And it's simple. And it's also humbling, that the reality of that is humbling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And oftentimes in life, things are not that simple, not that black and white.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's nice to have that sometimes. That's the biggest thing I gained from jiu-jitsu, is getting my ass kicked, was the humbling. And it's nice to just get humbled in a very clear way. Sports in general are great for that. I think surfing probably because I can imagine just face planting, not being able to stay on the board. It's humbling. And the power of the wave is humbling. So just like your mom, you're an adventurer. Your bucket list is probably like 120 pages.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There are things that just popped to mind that you're thinking about, especially in the near future? Just anything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like it'd be such a great experience to do with my kids and I'd love to have that experience with them. I also told Arabella, we were talking about this archery competition that happens in Mongolia, and she loves horseback riding. So I'm like, I feel like that would be an amazing thing to experience together. I want to get barreled by a wave and learn how to play Texas Flood. I want to see the Northern Lights. I want to go and experience that. I feel like that would be really beautiful. I want to get my black belt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Black belt? Nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I asked you, \"How long did it take?\" So I want to get my black belt in jiu-jitsu. That's going to be a longer-term goal, but within the next decade. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Outer space?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A lot of things. I'd love to go to space. Not just space. I think I'd love to go to the moon.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Like step on the moon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Or float in close proximity, like that famous photo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. With just you in a...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The space suit. I feel like Mars is, [inaudible 03:00:18] at this point in my life... Well, the moon's like four days, feels more manageable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know. But the sunset on Mars is blue. It's the opposite color. I hear it's beautiful. It might be worth it. I don't know.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You negotiate with Theo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Let me know how it goes. Let me know how it goes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think actually, just even going to space where you can look back on Earth. I think that just to see this little-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Pale blue dot?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... pale blue dot, just all the stuff that ever happened in human civilization is on that. And to be able to look at it and just be in awe, I don't think that's a thing that will go away.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>inclination, like the human desire to conquer territory and expand the footprint of civilization. That sometimes feels much more rooted in dominance and conquest than curiosity, wonder. And obviously, I think there's maybe an existential imperative for it at some point, or a strategic and security one. But I hope that what feels inevitable at this moment, I mean, you know Elon Musk and what he's doing with SpaceX and Jeff Bezos and others, it feels like it's not an if, it's a when at this point. I hope it also underscores the need to protect what we have here.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I hope it's the curiosity that drives that exploration. And I hope the exploration will give us a deeper appreciation of the thing we have back home, and that Earth will always be home and it's a home that we protect and celebrate. What gives you hope about the future of this thing we have going on? Human civilization, the whole thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think I feel a lot of hope when I'm in nature.
