{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|><|introduction|><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Ivanka Trump, businesswoman, real estate developer, and former senior advisor to the president of the United States. I've gotten to know Ivanka well over the past two years. We've become good friends, hitting it off right away over our mutual love of reading, especially philosophical writings from Marcus Aurelius, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts, Victor Franco, and so on. She is a truly kind, compassionate, and thoughtful human being. In the past, people have attacked her, in my view, to get indirectly at her dad, Donald Trump, as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism. These attacks obscured many projects and efforts, often bipartisan, that she helped get done, and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being. Through all that, she never returned the attacks with anything but kindness and always walked through the fire of it all with grace. For this, and much more, she is an inspiration and I'm honored to be able to call her a friend. Oh, and for those living in the United States, happy upcoming 4th of July. It's both an anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence and an anniversary of my immigrating here to the U.S. I'm forever grateful for this amazing country, for this amazing life, for all of you who have given a chance to a silly kid like me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ivanka Trump. You said that ever since you were young, you wanted to be a builder, that you loved the idea of designing beautiful city skylines, especially in New York City. I love the New York City skyline. So, describe the origins of that love of building.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>unbridled in a way that kind of makes you blush as an adult. And I think it's fun. It's fun to tap into that energy.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, where everything is possible. I think some of the greatest builders I've ever met, kind of always have that little flame of everything is possible, still burning. That is a silly notion from youth, but it's not so silly. Everybody tells you something is impossible, but if you continue believing that it's possible and to have that sort of naive notion that you could do it, even if it's exceptionally difficult, that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects ever done.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Going out to space or building a new company where like everybody said, it's impossible, taking on that gigantic company and disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done, or doing huge building projects where, like you said, so many people are involved in making that happen.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>We get conditioned out of that feeling.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that and also to smile, right? Because whether you can execute or not, time will tell. But yeah, no, that was very much my childhood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course, it's important to also have the humility of once you get humbled and realize that it's actually a lot of work to build.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I still am amazed just looking at big buildings, big bridges, that human beings are able to get together and build those things. That's one of my favorite things about architecture is just like, wow. It's a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something epic, much bigger than themselves, and it's like a statue that represents that and it can be there for a long time.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I think, in some ways, you look out at different city skylines and it's almost like a visual depiction of ambition realized, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you look at these skylines, and it's a testament to that. I actually heard once architecture described as frozen music. That really resonated with me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love thinking about a city skyline as an ensemble of dreams realized.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on our tower in Chicago. He said that the only thing that limited what an architect could do in that area was gravity and imagination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but gravity is a tricky one to work against, and that's where civil engineer is one of my favorite things. I used to build bridges in high school for physics classes. You have to build bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative to their own weight. You study how good it is by finding its breaking point. And that was a deep appreciation for me, on a miniature scale of on a large scale, what people are able to do with civil engineering because gravity is a tricky one to fight against.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It definitely is. And bridges, I mean, some of the iconic designs in our country are incredible bridges.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, if we think of skylines as ensembles of dreams realized, you spent quite a bit of time in New York. What do you love about and what do you think about the New York City skyline? What's a good picture? We're looking here at a few. I mean, looking over the water.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>skylines as well, and thinking back to when different components that are so iconic were added and the context in which they came into being.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I got to ask you about this. There's a pretty cool page that I've been following on X, Architecture & Tradition, and they celebrate traditional schools of architecture. And you mentioned Gothic, the tapestry. This is in Chicago, the Tribune Tower in Chicago. So, what do you think about that, the old and the new mixed together? Do you like Gothic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mentioned the Woolworth Tower before. The Woolworth Tower was actually referred to as the Cathedral of Commerce, because it also was in that Gothic style.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Amazing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And now, the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river, but also the Tribune building and other buildings on Michigan Avenue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you like it when the reflective properties of the glass is part of the architecture?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>gets super green, and that's a choice. And sometimes you have more blue properties, blue-silver, like you see here, but it's part of the character.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How do you know what it's actually going to look like when it's done? Is it possible to imagine that? Because it feels like there's so many variables.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of it that's blocking 80% of its views of the ... Architects, they'll remove things that are inconvenient. So, you have to be rooted in-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In reality.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>In reality. Exactly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And I love the notion of living with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of the drawings.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, both are probably important, because you have to dream the thing into existence, but you also have to be rooted in what the thing is actually going to look like in the context of everything else.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the underlying principles of the page I just mentioned, and I hear folks mention this a lot, is that modern architecture is kind of boring, that it lacks soul and beauty. And you just spoke with admiration for both modern and for Gothic, for older architecture. So, do you think there's truth that modern architecture is boring?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>older examples, the Sydney Opera House. And so, I think there's unbelievable ... There you go. I mean, that's like a needle in the sky.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Reaching out to the stars.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was the historical Old Post Office building in Washington D.C. You look at a building like that and it feels like it has no equal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Also, there's a psychological element where people tend to want to complain about the new and celebrate the old.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Always. It's like the history of time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's just, people are always skeptical and concerned about change. And it's true that there's a lot of stuff that's new that's not good, it's not going to last, it's not going to stand the test of time, but some things will. And just like in modern art and modern music, there's going to be artists that stand the test of time and we'll later look back and celebrate them, \"Those were the good times.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you just step back, what do you love about architecture? Is it the beauty? Is it the function?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>elements, and it's all wrapped up in this one effort. So, to me, it's exciting to sort of flex in all of those different ways.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Like you said, it's dreams realized, hard work realized. I mean, probably on the bridge side is why I love the function. In terms of function being primary, you just think of the millions-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Oh my gosh, look at that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>... bridges-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Go down. Look at that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. This is Devil's Bridge in Germany.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I wouldn't say it's the most practical design, but look how beautiful that is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, this is probably ... Well, we don't know. We need to interview some people whether the function holds up, but in terms of beauty, and then, what we're talking about, using the water for the reflection and the shape that it creates, I mean, there's an elegance to the shape of a bridge.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>See, it's interesting that they call it Devil's Bridge because to me, this is very ethereal. I think about the ring, the circle, life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's nothing about this that makes me feel ... Maybe they're just being ironic in the names.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Unless that function's really flawed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, exactly. Maybe-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Nobody's ever successfully crossed it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Could cross the bridge. Yeah. But I mean, to me, there's just iconic ... I love looking at bridges because of the function. It's the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge. I mean, those are probably my favorites in the United States. Just in a city, to be able to look out and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge, and thinking of all the millions of cars that pass, the busyness, us humans getting together and going to work, building cool stuff. And just the bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it creates. It's cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And the connectivity as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. The network of roads all come together. So, there, the bridge is the ultimate combination of function and beauty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in New York, that was as much a part of the architectural story and tapestry of that skyline as any building that's seen in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What in general is your philosophy of design and building in architecture?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a lot of limitations you have to work within, especially when you're repurposing a use. So, the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue was-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so beautiful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>looked at that and I think so did a lot of the other bidders and say, \"It's worth trying to put the best vision forward.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you fell in love with this project? This-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I fell in love. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, is there some interesting details about what it takes to do renovation, about some of the challenges or opportunities? Because you want to maintain the beauty of the old and now upgrade the functionality, I guess, and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the building magical in the first place.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>blood, sweat, tears, years of my life for those projects, and it was worth it. I enjoyed, almost, I enjoyed almost every minute of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, to you, it's not about the flipping, to you, it's about the art and the function of the thing that you're creating?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What's design on plan? I'm learning new things today.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think even with ground-up construction as well, people who aren't constantly on their job sites, constantly walking the projects, there's a lot that's missed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, there's a wisdom to the idea that we talked about before, live with the materials and walking the construction site, walking the rooms. I mean, that's what you hear from people like Steve Jobs, like Elon. That's why you live on the factory floor. That's why you constantly obsess about the details of the actual, not of the plans, but the physical reality of the product. I mean, the insanity of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive working together on making it perfect, making the iPhone, the early designs, prototypes, making that perfect, what it actually feels like in the hand. You have to be there as close to the metal as possible to truly understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And you have to love it in order to do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Right. It shouldn't be about how much it's going to sell for and all that kind of stuff. You have to love the art.<|eot_id|>"}

So, I think that extra effort, that passion, I think that's what separates good from great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If we go back to that young Ivanka, the confidence of youth, and if we could talk about your mom. She had a big influence on you. You told me she was an adventurer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Olympic skier and a businesswoman. What did you learn about life from your mother?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>living life to its fullest. And she had so much courage, so much conviction, so much energy, and a complete comfort with who she was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about that? Olympic athlete. The trade-off between ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that, and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy every moment of life. That trade-off. What do you think about that trade-off?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>follow her around at construction meetings and on job sites. And there she is, dancing. See? That's funny that that's the picture you pull up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'm sorry. The two of you just look great in that picture.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>opinions. She made my father look reserved, so whatever she was feeling, she was just very expressive and a lot of fun to be around.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So she, as you mentioned, grew up during the Prague Spring in 1968, and that had a big impact on human history. My family came from the Soviet Union. And then the story of the 20th century is a lot of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, tried the ideas of communism, and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering. So why do you think the communist ideology failed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>didn't have to walk up the mountain. You'd be plenty warm if you had carried the skis up on your back, up the last run.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I feel like they made people tougher back then, like my grandma. And you mentioned, it's funny, they go through some of the darkest things that a human being can go through and they don't talk about it, and they have a general positive outlook on life that's deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be. How bad it could get. My grandma survived Holodomor in Ukraine, which was a mass starvation brought on by the collectivist policies of the Stalin regime, and then she survived the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Never talked about it. Probably went through extremely dark, extremely difficult times, and then just always had a positive outlook on life. And also made me do very difficult physical activity, as you mentioned, just to humble you. Kids these days are soft kind of energy, which I'm deeply, deeply grateful for on all fronts, including just having hardship and including just physical hardship flung at me. I think that's really important.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the fact that you could get an orange in the winter, but she couldn't be too excited by it that she'd become a flight risk.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, boy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a 14-year-old was dealing with, so I have so much respect and admiration for her.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, hardship clarifies what's important in life. You and I have talked about Man's Search for Meaning, that book. Having an ultimate hardship clarifies that finding joy in life is not about the environment, it's about your outlook on that environment. And there's beauty to be found in any situation. And also, in that particular situation, when everything is taken from you, the thing you start to think about is the people you love. So in the case of Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl thinking about his wife and how much he loves her, and that love was the flame, the warmth that kept him excited. The fun thing to think about when everything else is gone. So we sometimes forget that with the busyness of life, you get all this fun stuff we're talking about like building and being a creative force in the world. At the end of the day, what matters is just the other humans in your life, the people you love.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's the simple stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to us. And Viktor Frankl does an amazing job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances, and I think it's just super inspiring to me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He also shows that you can get so much from just small joys, like getting a little more soup today than you did yesterday. It's the little stuff. If you allow yourself to love the little stuff of life, it's all around you. It's all there. So you don't need to have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy, that kind of stuff. It's all around us. The ability to eat. When I was in the jungle and I got severely dehydrated, because there's no water, you run out of water real quick. And the joy I felt when I got to drink. I didn't care about anything else. Speaking of things that matter in life, I would start to fantasize about water, and that was bringing me joy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can tap into this feeling at any time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. I was just tapping in, just to stay positive.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just go into your bathroom, turn on the sink and watch the water to feel good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, for sure. For sure. It's good to have stuff taken away for a time. That's why struggle is good, to make you appreciate it. To have a deep gratitude for when you have it. And water and food is a big one, but water is the biggest one. I wouldn't recommend it necessarily, to get severely dehydrated to appreciate water, but maybe every time you take a sip of water, you can have that kind of gratitude.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I haven't accepted or internalized all of this wisdom, so to speak, but it was just funny.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in that regard. So I'm the opposite. I start with, \"Well, I want to be comfortable,\" and that helps me be confident and in command.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A foundation for fashion for you is comfort.

You see, you want to do that a lot, which is basically ask questions to push simplification. Can we do this simpler? The basic question is, \"Why are we doing it this way? Can this be done simpler?\" And not taking as an answer that this is how we've always done it. It doesn't matter that's how we've always done it. What is the right way to do it?

Usually, it's going to be a bunch of paperwork, so nobody knows what they're actually do. So when it's flat, you can actually get as quickly as possible with when problems arise, you can solve those problems as quickly as possible. And also, you have a direct, rapid, iterative process where you're making things simpler, making them more efficient, and constantly improving. Yeah. It's interesting. You see this in government. A lot of people get together, a hierarchy is developed, and sometimes it's good, but very often just slows things down.

Again, the Steve Jobs thing, it's not the opinion poll. You can't poll people and ask them what looks better. You have to have the vision of that. And as you said, you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your taste is good, such that you can curate, you can direct teams. You can argue that no, no, no, this is right.

Just the recognizing you and catching your eye and just showing his excitement by wiggling his butt and tail and all this intense joy that overtakes his body, that moment of recognizing something. It's the double take, that moment of where this joy of recognition takes over your whole cognition and you're just there and there's a connection. And then the other person gets excited and you both get excited together. It's kind of like that feeling... How would I put it? When you go to airports and you get to see people who haven't seen each other for a time all of a sudden recognize each other in their meeting and they're all run towards each other in a hug?

But you've also mentioned somebody you admire is Rick Rubin in his book, The Creative Act. It has some really interesting ideas, and one of them is to accept self-doubt and imperfection.

Giving away a very large amount of money and moving it in another direction on an impulse. Making a promise that he can't at that time deliver, but knows if he works hard, he'll deliver and all... Just following that impulsive feeling. And he said now that he has a family, that probably some of that impulse is quieted down a little bit. He's more rational and thoughtful and so on, but wonders whether it's sometimes good to just be impulsive and to just trust your gut and just go with it. Don't deliberate too long because then you won't do it. It's interesting.

You can feel the stories emanate from the buildings. And that same way when you look at giant trees that have been there for decades, for centuries in some cases, you feel the history, the stories emanate.

It sounds simple to say, but when you actually experience it stays with you for a long time. Especially if you're out there alone. I got a chance to spend time in the jungle solo, just by myself. And you sit in the fear of that, in the simplicity of that, all of it, and just no sounds of humans anywhere. You're just sitting there and listening to all the monkeys and the birds trying to have sex with each other, all around you just screaming. And I mean, I romanticize everything, there's birds that are monogamous for life, like macaws, you could see two of them flying. They're also, by the way, screaming at each other.

It reminds you of several things. One, that people, well, it shows you that there's a lot of different accents, that's for one. But aside from that, that people are struggling with all the same stuff. And at least at that time, I wonder what it is now, but at that time, I don't remember. On the surface, there's political divisions, there's Republicans and Democrats, and so on, but underneath it people were all the same. The concerns were all the same, there was not that much of a division. Right now, the surface division has been amplified even more maybe because of social media, I don't know why. So, I would love to see what the country's like now. But I suspect probably it's still not as divided as it appears to be on the surface, what the media shows, what the social media shows.

Maybe I just romanticize westerns, but anyway. All right, I miss Clint Eastwood movies. Okay. But it's true. You read some of this stuff in terms of what politics used to be in the history of the United States. Those folks went pretty rough, way rougher, actually. But they didn't have social media, so they had to go real hard. And the media was rough too. So all the fake news, all of that, that's not recent. It's been nonstop. I look at the surface division, the surface bickering, and that might be just a feature of democracy. It's not a bug of democracy, it's a feature. We're in a constant conflict, and it's the way we resolve, we try to figure out the right way forward. So in the moment, it feels like people are just tearing each other apart, but really we're trying to find a way, where in the long arc of history it will look like progress. But in the short term, it just sounds like people making stories up about other and calling each other names, and all this kind of stuff, but there's a purpose to it.

The scale of impact is 40 million families, each one of those is a story, is a story of struggle, of trying to give a large part of your life to a job while still being able to give love and support and care to a family, to kids, and to manage all of that. Each one of those is a little puzzle that they have to solve. And it's a life and death puzzle. You can lose your home, your security, you can lose your job, you can screw stuff up with parenting, so you can mess all of that up and you're trying to hold it together, and government policies can help make that easier, or can in some cases make that possible.

I'm sure there's a lot of politicians playing games with that because maybe it's a Republican that came up with an idea or a Democrat that came up with an idea, and so they don't want to give credit to the idea.

There's probably the details are important too.

I often see that, especially with coaches and athletes, young athletes aspiring to be great. Each athlete needs to be trained in a different way. For example, with some, you need a softer approach. With me, I always like a dictatorial approach. I like the coach to be this menacing figure. That's what brought out the best in me. I didn't want to be friends with the coach. I wanted almost, it's weird to say, but yelled at to be pushed. But that doesn't work for everybody.

That's part of the growing up process. But you want to always, especially if it's physical, they're pushing each other. You want to kind of stop it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot. We've talked about a lot of musicians. Who do you enjoy? You mentioned Adele, seeing her perform, hanging out with her.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>who she believed in was very beautiful. So anyway, that was an extraordinary concert experience for my kids to be able to have that moment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What a story. So that's the...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Then here we are dancing at Adele.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly, exactly. It's like that turning point.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Six years later was almost to the day, six years later.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that policy, that meeting of the minds resulted in a major turning point in her life and Alice's life. And now you're even dancing with Adele.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And now we're at Adele.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, you mentioned also there, I've seen commutations where it's an opportunity to step in and consider the ways that the justice system does not always work well like in cases when it's nonviolent crime and drug offenses, there's a case of a person you mentioned that received a life sentence for selling weed. And it's just the number... It's like hundreds of thousands of people are in the federal prison, in jail, in the system for selling drugs. That's the only thing. With no violence on their record whatsoever. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity. There's the details matter, but oftentimes, the justice system does not do right in the way we think right is, and it's nice to be able to step in and help people indirectly.<|eot_id|>"}

I love it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, Kim wasn't at the Adele show, but-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, she's the... Got it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>She had connected us. It was beautiful. It was really beautiful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The way Adele can hold just the badassness she has on stage, she does heartbreak songs better than anyone. Or no, it's not even heartbreak. What's that genre of song, like Rolling in the Deep, like a little anger, a little love, a little something, a little attitude, and just one of the greatest voices ever. All that together just her by herself.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there and watch these old shows. We both love Stevie Ray Vaughan, like watching him perform. You can even find old videos of Django Reinhardt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got me.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I got you-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Stevie Ray Vaughan.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... Texas Flood.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We had this moment, which is hilarious that you said one of the songs you really like of Stevie's is Texas Flood.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, my bucket list is to learn how to play it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a bucket list. This is a bucket list item. You made me feel so good because for me, Texas Flood was the first solo on guitar I've ever learned because for me, it was the impossible solo. And then so I worked really hard to learn it. It's like one of the most iconic sort of blues songs, Texas blues songs. And now, you made me fall in love with the song again and want to play it out live, at the very least, put it up on YouTube because it's so fun to improvise. And when you lose yourself in the song, it truly is a blues song. You can have fun with it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I hope you do do that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Throw on a Stevie Ray Vaughan-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But he's amazing. And there's so many great performers that are playing live now. I just saw Chris Stapleton's show. He's an amazing country artist.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's too good.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was in LA. It was like the Temple Missionary Baptist Church. Talk about stripped down. She's literally a...

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The spirit you feel in her when you watch this.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's true. Adele carries some of that spirit also. Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you see the arc of also the experience of the people in the choir and them starting to join in. And anyway, it's amazing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love watching Queen, like Freddie Mercury, Queen performances in terms of vocalists and just great stage presence.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That Live Aid performance is considered one of the best of all, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've watched that so many times. He's so cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>part where he's singing Radio Ga Ga and they're all mimicking in his arm movements. It's so cool. Radio ga ga. All we hear is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Look at that.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's an example of a person that was born to be on stage.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And normally, it happens in the context of community. You go with friends and then allowing yourself to sort of fall into it is incredible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've been training jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. Trying.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, I've seen you do jiu-jitsu. You're very athletic. You know how to use your body to commit violence. Maybe there's better ways of phrasing that, but anyway-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's been a skill that's been honed over time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I mean, what do you like about jiu-jitsu?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Theo saw us doing it, they wanted to start doing it. So now they joined and then Jared joined. So now, we're all doing jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm. That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and awareness and balance. And it's an unbelievable thing. And they'll actually integrate it into conversations where they'll talk about something that... Yeah, rectitude, courage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty. So this is not about jiu-jitsu techniques or fighting techniques. This is about a way of life, about the way you interact with the world with other people. Exercise, nutrition, rest, hygiene, positivity, that's more on the physical side of things. Awareness, balance, and flow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>things that happen in their life, large and small, and has been beautiful. So I do think that body-mind connection is super strong in jiu-jitsu.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's many things I love about the Valente Brothers, but one of them is the how rooted it is in philosophy and history of martial arts in general. A lot of places, you'll practice the sport of it, maybe the art of it, but to recognize the history and what it means to be a martial artist broadly on and off the mat, that's really great. And the other thing that's great is they also don't forget the self-defense root, the actual fighting roots. So it's not just a sport, it's a way to defend yourself on the street in all situations. And that gives you a confidence in, just like you said, an awareness about your own body and awareness about others. Sadly, we forget, but it's a world full of violence or the capacity for violence. So it's good to have an awareness of that and the confidence how to essentially avoid it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>hard concepts to internalize as an adult, but especially when you're 12, 10, and 8 respectively. So it's been an amazing experience for us all.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I love people like Pedro because he's finding books that are in Japanese and translating them to try to figure out the details of a particular history. He's an ultra scholar of martial arts, and I love that. I love when people give everything, every part of themselves to the thing they're practicing. People have been fighting each other for a very long time. From the Colosseum on. You can't fake anything. You can't lie about anything. It's truly honest. You're there and you either win or lose. And it's simple. And it's also humbling, that the reality of that is humbling.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And oftentimes in life, things are not that simple, not that black and white.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's nice to have that sometimes. That's the biggest thing I gained from jiu-jitsu, is getting my ass kicked, was the humbling. And it's nice to just get humbled in a very clear way. Sports in general are great for that. I think surfing probably because I can imagine just face planting, not being able to stay on the board. It's humbling. And the power of the wave is humbling. So just like your mom, you're an adventurer. Your bucket list is probably like 120 pages.<|eot_id|>"}
