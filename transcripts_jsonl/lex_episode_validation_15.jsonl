And then there's the foreign nanny state where effectively we are subsidizing other countries that aren't paying their fair share of protection or other resources we provide them. If I was to summarize my ideology, in a nutshell, it is to terminate the nanny state in the United States of America in all of its forms, the entitlement state, the regulatory state and the foreign policy nanny state. Once we've done that, we've revived the republic that I think would make George Washington proud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy about the future of conservatism in America. He has written many books on this topic, including his latest called Truths: The Future of America First. He ran for president this year in the Republican primary and is considered by many to represent the future of the Republican Party. Before all that, he was a successful biotech entrepreneur and investor with a degree in biology from Harvard and a law degree from Yale. As always, when the topic is politics, I will continue talking to people on both the left and the right with empathy, curiosity and backbone. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Vivek Ramaswamy. You are one of the great elucidators of conservative ideas, so you're the perfect person to ask. What is conservatism? What's your, let's say, conservative vision for America?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>some policy commitments and principles, merit, free speech, self-governance, rule of law. And then I think culturally what does it mean to be a conservative is it means we believe in the anchors of our identity, in truth, the value of the individual family, nation and God beat race, gender, sexuality and climate. If we have the courage to actually stand for our own vision. And that's a big part of what's been missing. And it's a big part of not just through the campaign, but through a lot of my future advocacy, that's the vacuum I'm aiming to fill.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, we'll talk about each of those issues. Immigration, the growing bureaucracy of government, religion is a really interesting topic, something you've spoken about a lot, but you've also had a lot of really tense debates. So you're a perfect person to ask to steel man the other side.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let me ask you about progressivism.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you steel man the case for progressivism and left- wing ideas?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a good of why the left believes they have a compelling case for the government stepping into correct for historical or present inequalities. I can give you my counter rebuttal of that, but the best statement of the left, I think that it's the fact that we've been imperfect in living up to those ideals. In order to fix that, we're going to have to take steps that are severe steps if needed to correct for those historical inequalities before we actually have true equality of opportunity in this country. That's the case for the left-wing view in modern America.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what's your criticism of that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not just fame or currency or whatever it is. There's just going to be different outcomes for different people in different spheres of lives. And that's what meritocracy demands. It's what it requires. And so the left's vision of group equity necessarily comes at the cost of meritocracy. And so those would be my two reasons for opposing the view is one is it's not meritocratic, but number two is it often even has the effect of hurting the very people they claimed to have wanted to help. And I think that's part of what we're seeing in modern America.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you had a pretty intense debate with Mark Cuban, a great conversation. I think it's on your podcast actually.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes. Yeah, it was great.<|eot_id|>"}

Well, speaking of good guys, he messages me all the time with beautifully eloquent criticism. I appreciate that, Mark. What was one of the more convincing things he said to you? You're mostly focused on kind of DEI.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>last four years across this country. It's been pretty rampant. I think it leaves America worse off. The beauty of America is we're a country where we should be able to have institutions that are stronger from different points of view being expressed. But my number one criticism of the DEI agenda is not even that it's anti-meritocratic, it is anti-meritocratic, but my number one criticism is it's actually hostile to the free and open exchange of ideas by creating often legal liabilities for organizations that even permit certain viewpoints to be expressed. And I think that's the biggest concern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think what Mark would say is that diversity allows you to look for talent in places where you haven't looked before and therefore find really special talents, special people. I think that's the case he made.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>regimes in part enforced by the government to do it. Today, to be a government contractor, for example, you have to adopt certain racial and gender representation targets in your workforce. That's not the free market working. So I think you can't have it both ways either. It's going to be good for companies and companies are going to do what's in their self-interest. That's what capitalists like Mark Cuban and I believe. But if we really believe that, then we should let the market work rather than forcing it to adopt these top-down standards. That's my issue with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know what it is about human psychology, but whenever you have a sort of administration, a committee that gets together to do a good thing, the committee starts to use the good thing, the ideology behind wish there's a good ideal, to bully people and to do bad things. I don't know what it is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>shifted away from just combating wokeness because that's just a symptom, I think, versus combating actual bureaucracy itself. The rise of this managerial class, the rise of the deep state. We talk about that in the government, but the deep state doesn't just exist in the government. It exists I think in every sphere of our lives, from companies to nonprofits to universities. It's the rise of we call the managerial class, the committee class, the people who professionally sit on committees, I think are wielding far more power today than actual creators, entrepreneurs, original ideators and ordinary citizens alike.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you need managers, but as few as possible. It seems like when you have a giant managerial class, the actual doers don't get to do. But like you said, bureaucracy is a phenomena of both the left and the right. This is not-<|eot_id|>"}

He even invented a number of musical instruments that Mozart and Beethoven went on to use. That's just Benjamin Franklin. So you think, \"Oh, he's a one-off.\" Everybody say, okay, he was the one zany founder who was also a creative scientific innovator who happened to be one of the founders of the country. Wrong, it wasn't unique to him. You have Thomas Jefferson. What are you sitting in right now? You're sitting on a swivel chair. Okay.

And the likes of Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin and I could give you examples of John Adams or Robert Livingston, you go straight down the list of founding fathers who were inventors, creators, pioneers, explorers, who also were the very people who came together to sign the Declaration of Independence. And so yeah, this rise of bureaucracy in America in every sphere of life, I view it as anti-American actually. And I hope that conservatives and liberals alike can get behind my crusade certainly to get in there and shut most of it down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, speaking of shutting most of it down, how do you propose we do that? How do we make government more efficient? How to make it smaller? What are the different ideas of how to do that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>way I would do it, 75% headcount reduction across the board in the federal bureaucracy, send them home packing, shut down agencies that shouldn't exist, rescind every unconstitutional regulation that Congress never passed. In a true self-governing democracy, it should be our elected representatives that make the laws and the rules not unelected bureaucrats. And that is the single greatest form of economic stimulus we could have in this country, but it is also the single most effective way to restore self-governance in our country as well. And it is the blueprint for, I think, how we save this country.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's pretty gangster, 75%. There's this kind of almost meme like video of Argentinian President Javier Milei, where on a whiteboard, he has all the I think 18 ministries lined up and he's ripping, \"Department of Education, gone,\" and he's just going like this. Now, the situation in Argentina is pretty dire and the situation in the United States is not, despite everybody saying the empire is falling, this is still, in my opinion, the greatest nation on earth. Still, the economy is doing very well. Still, this is the hub of culture, the hub of innovation, the hub of so many amazing things. Do you think it's possible to do something like firing 75% of people in government when things are going relatively well?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>raise not only the civic character of the United States, now we feel, okay, the people we elect to run the government, they've got the power back, they're running the government again, as opposed to the unelected bureaucrats who wield the power today, it would also stimulate the economy. The regulatory state is like a wet blanket on the American economy. Most of it is unconstitutional. All we require is leadership with a spine to get in there and actually do what conservative presidents have maybe gestured towards and talked about, but have not really effectuated ever in modern history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And by the way, that kind of thing would attract the ultra-competent that actually want to work in government.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Exactly. Which you're missing today because right now, the government would swallow them up. Most competent people feel like that bureaucratic machine will swallow them whole. You clear the decks of 75% of them, real innovators can then show up.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's kind of this cynical view of capitals where people think that the only reason you do anything is to earn more money, but I think a lot of people would want to work in government to build something that's helpful to a huge number of people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dilutes the sense of mission out of any organization, whether it's a company or government agency or bureaucracy. And once you've done that, then you lose the ability to track the best and the brightest, because in order for somebody to achieve the maximum of their potential, they have to know what it's towards. There has to be a mission in the first place. Then you're not getting the best and brightest, you get more from the committee class, and that becomes a self-perpetuating downward spiral, and that is what the blob of the federal bureaucracy really looks like today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you said something really profound. At the individual scale of the individual contributor, doer, creator, what happens is, you have a certain capacity to do awesome shit, and then there's barriers that come up. We have to wait a little bit. This happens, there's friction always. When humans together are working on something, there's friction. And so, the goal of a great company is to minimize that friction, minimize the number of barriers. And what happens is, the managerial class, the incentive is for it to create barriers.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the maximum of their own potential contributions. And I certainly feel that myself. I probably identify as being a member of that creator class most closely. It's just what I've done, I create things. And I think we live in an environment in the United States of America where we're still probably the best country on earth where that creator has that shot, so that's the positive side of it, but one where we are far more constrictive to the creator class than we have been when we've been at our best, and that's what I want to see change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can you steelman the perspective of somebody that looks at a particular department, Department of Education, and are saying that the amount of pain that will be caused by closing it and firing 75% of people will be too much?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a beautiful thing to do. You don't see that happen enough in the American consciousness, in the American culture of, when an institution has achieved its purpose, celebrate it, and then move on. And I think that that culture in our government would result in a vastly restrained scope of government, rather than, today it's a one-way ratchet. Once you cause it to come into existence, you cause new things to come into existence, but the old one that came into existence continues to persist and exist as well, and that's where you get this metastasis over the last century.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, what kind of things do you think government should do that the private sector, the forces of capitalism would create drastic inequalities or create the kind of pain we don't want to have in government?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>seeking prosperity, you're free to do it, but if you're hurting somebody, else without their consent, in the process, the government is there to enforce what is really just a different form of enforcing a private property right. So, I would say that those are two central functions of government, is to preserve national boundaries in the national security of a homeland, and number two is to protect and preserve private property rights and the enforcement of those private property rights. And I think, at that point, you've described about 80 to 90% of the proper role of a government.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about infrastructure?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this. But broadly speaking, 80 to 90% of the goal of the federal government, I'm not going to say 100, 80 to 90% of the goal of the existence of a federal government, of government, period, should be to protect national boundaries and provide security for the people who live there, and to protect the private property rights of the people who reside there. If we restore that, I think we're well on our way to a revival of what our founding fathers envisioned, and I think many of them would give you the same answer that I just did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, if we get government out of education, would you be also for reducing this as a government in the states for something like education?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>accounts, or whichever mechanism it is, to opt out of that, if that's done locally, I'll have views on that that tend to go further in the direction of true educational choice and diversity of choice. The implementation of charter schools, the granting of state charters, or even lowering the barriers to granting one, I favor those kinds of policies. But if we've gotten the federal government out of it, that's achieved 75% of what I think we need to achieve, that I'm focused on solving other problems, and leave that to the states and municipalities to cover from there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, given this conversation, what do you think of Elon's proposal of the Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump Administration, or really, any administration?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I'm, of course, biased because Elon and I had discussed that for the better part of the last year and a half, which I think it's a great idea. It's something that's very consistent with the core premise of my presidential candidacy. I got to know him, as I was running for US president, in a couple of events that he came to, and then we built a friendship after that. So, obviously, I think it's a great idea.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Who do you think is more hardcore on the cutting, you or Elon?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a very large number of very powerful people that have gotten used to and a budget that's increasing, and the number of wars and military conflicts that's increasing.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So this is the number one priority. It's like there's difficulty levels here. The DOD would be, probably, the hardest, so let's take that on. What's your view on the Military Industrial Complex, Department of Defense, and wars in general?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Chief of the United States of America, yet, on paper, supposedly we're still are supposed to call him that. But at least in theory, we're supposed to have civilian control of the US Military. And I think that one of the things that that leader needs to do is to ask the question of, again, the mission. What's the purpose of this US Military in the first place? At the top of the list should be to protect the homeland and the people who actually live here, which we're failing to do. So, that's where I land on that question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, okay, there's a lot of stuff to ask. First of all, on Joe Biden, do you mean he's functionally not in control of the US Military because of the age factor or because of the nature of the presidency?<|eot_id|>"}

One of the things that I wish, and this is on me, not anybody else, that I should have done better, was to make that more crystal clear as a focus without getting distracted by a lot of the shenanigans, let's just say, that happened as side-shows during a presidential campaign.

I think we're going to fix a lot of them in the next four years if Donald Trump's president.

I don't want to see the bureaucracy expand in a pro-conservative direction. I want to see the bureaucracy shrink in every direction.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>For my own benefit, to be honest, selfish.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You also don't lose your shit. So you don't take it personally. You don't get emotional, but you get emotional sort of in a positive way. You get passionate, but you don't get... I've never seen you broken to where they get you outraged, probably because you just love the heat.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>curious about that, I mean the climate change protestors that have interrupted my events, I'm as fascinated by the psychology of what's moving them and what they might be hungry for as I am concerned about rebutting the content of what they're saying to me. And I think that that's certainly something I care to revive. We don't talk about in politics that much, but reviving that sense of curiosity I think is in a certain way, one of the ways we're going to be able to disagree, but still remain friends and fellow citizens at the end of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I agree with you. I think fundamentally most people are good. And one of the things I love most about humans is the very thing you said, which is curiosity. I think we should lean into that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>have to be an expert trained in one of those things to be able to engage in it, but actually maybe, just maybe you might even be better at each of those things because you're curious about the other, the Renaissance man, if you will. I think we've lost a little bit of that concept in America, but it's certainly something that is important to me. And this year it's been kind of cool. After leaving the campaign, I've been doing a wide range of things. I've been picking up my tennis game again. I practiced at the Ohio State-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're damn good at tennis. I was watching you-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I used to be better, but I'm picking it up again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Somebody online was trying to correctly, I think you shot a very particular angle of that video. I think they were criticizing your backhand was weak potentially because you're-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That would be fair criticism. But it's gotten better again. It's gotten better recently. I've been playing, I've been practicing with the Ohio State team in the morning. They're like number one in the country or close to it. Now the guys on the team play, but there's a couple coaches who were recently on the team, one of whom used to be, a guy used to play within the juniors who invited me out. So I hit with them in the mornings alongside the team. My goal-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, don't say it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I should be careful here. Oh no, my hips are telling others, so I've been playing so many days a week-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, no, please don't.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>... that I set a goal for myself to play in a particular tournament, but we'll see if that happens or not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, no.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a very cool movie to be a part of. I have actually started a couple companies, one company in particular that I think is going to be significant this year, guiding some of the other businesses that I've gotten off the ground in the past. So for me, I'm re-energized now where I was involved in the thick of politics for a full year there. And getting a little bit of oxygen outside of politics, doing some things in the private sector has actually given me a renewed sense of energy to get back into driving change through public service.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, it's been fun watching you do all these fascinating things, but I do hope that you have a future in politics as well, because it's nice to have somebody that has rigorously developed their ideas and is honest about presenting them and is willing to debate those ideas out in public space. So I would love for you and people like you to represent the future of American politics. So Vivek, thank you so much. For every time I'm swiveling this chair, I'm thinking of Thomas Jefferson.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's good. That was my goal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So big shout out to Thomas Jefferson for the swivel chair, and thank you so much for talking today, Vivek. This was fun.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thank you, man. One final fact on Thomas Jefferson, whether you cut this or not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Of course.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He wrote 16,000 essays in his life, letters, right? So he said, \"I've written four books in four years.\" That is nothing compared to how prolific this guy was. Anyway, anyway, good stuff, man. Thanks for having me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Neither of us will ever live up to anything close to Thomas Jefferson.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I love your curiosity, man. Thanks for reading the book and appreciated your feedback on it as well. And hopefully we'll do this again sometime.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yep. Thank you brother.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Thanks dude.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy.

And now let me leave you with some words from George Orwell. \" Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
