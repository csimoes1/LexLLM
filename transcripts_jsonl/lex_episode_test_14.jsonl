This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ed Barnhart.

So a lot of their things were built out of dirt and trees and feathers and textiles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But is it possible that all that land that's not covered by trees is actually hiding stone, for example, some architecture, some things that are just very difficult to find for archeologists.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>here and there where the river dug deep. And even then only in the dry season, because that river rises over 100 feet every year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, that's one of the things, having visited that area, just interacting with waterfalls and seeing the water, I was humbled by the power of water to shape landscapes and probably erase history in the context that we're talking about of civilizations. Water can just make everything disappear over a period of centuries and millennia, and so if there's something existed a very long time ago, thousands of years ago, it's very possible it was just eaten up by nature.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's probably a lot that are just under the ocean, and just the wave action have destroyed them and what they haven't destroyed buried deep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Under the ocean. So you think Atlantis ever existed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the crater Akrotiri is strangely advanced for its age. And so if there's anything that's a model for Atlantis, as Plato explained it, it's Akrotiri.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Akrotiri, the ancient Greek city, it says, \"The settlement was destroyed in the Theran eruption sometime in the 16th century BCE and buried in volcanic ash, which preserved the remains of the frescoes and many objects and artworks.\" So we don't know how advanced that civilization was.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>at night. It was a vibrant city with a lot of, especially in terms of hydraulic engineering, it's very advanced for being 3,500 years old.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if you check it out, here's an image of the excavation. What a project.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can tell that it's just part of it because it's pretty close to where the crater begins. So the city itself was probably much larger.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in this case, there's a lot of evidence, but like we said, there could be civilizations that there is very little evidence of because of the natural environment that destroys all the evidence.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If it does exist, at least the model of it, I think this is probably what he was talking about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there could be other civilizations of which Plato has never written that we have no record of?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And it's humbling to think that entire civilizations with all the dreams, the hope, the technological innovation, the wars, the conflicts, the political tensions, all of that, the social interactions, the hierarchies, all of that, the art can be just destroyed like that and forgotten, completely lost to ancient history.<|eot_id|>"}

But we're barely getting started in terms of historical civilizations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So humans, homo sapiens evolved, but they didn't start civilizations right away. There was a long period of time when they did not form these complex societies. So how do we, let's say, 300,000 years ago in Africa, actually go from there to creating civilizations?<|eot_id|>"}

So once humans figured out how to stay in a place, I think there, that's the initial trigger to what would become civilization.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of questions I want to ask here. What do you think is the motivation for societies? Is it the carrot or the stick? So you said, is it when resources run out, when the old way of life is no longer feeding everybody, then you have to figure stuff out? Or is it more the carrot of there's always this human spirit that wants to explore, that wants to maybe impress the rest of the village or something like this with the new discovery they made in venturing out and coming out with different ideas or technological innovation, let's call it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think that it's much more the carrot than the stick. When things get ugly, the stick comes out, but usually the carrot does the job.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The really interesting story is how the first people came to the Americas. To me, that's pretty gangster, to go from Asia all the way potentially during the ice Age or maybe at the end of the ice age or during that whole period not knowing what the world looks like going into the unknown. Can you talk to that process? How did the first people come to the Americas?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to live. I listened to some of your podcasts, that guy, Jordan Jonas, he cut the mustard, but I wouldn't have made it crossing there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there you go. The fact that those guys exist, that somebody like Jordan Jonas exists, people that survive and thrive in these harsh conditions, that's an indication that it's possible. So when do you think and how did the first people come?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that, but now it's really very clear that they came over at least by 30,000 and the bridge opened and closed, then open and closed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's during the Ice Age?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, that's crazy, right? That is crazy.<|eot_id|>"}

If it's like 30,000 to 60,000 years ago, was it just gradual movement of these nomadic tribes as they follow the animals? Or was it like one explorer that pushed the tribe to just go, go, go, go, and go maybe across 100 years travel all the way across maybe into North America, where Canada is now, and then big leaps in movement versus gradual movement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>evidence to say they came in mass across Oceania. So they made it probably by boat along the coast all the way to South America.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's some kind of cultural engine that drove them to explore. So if you had to bet all your money, it happened like tens of thousands of years ago, but in a very rapid pace. There's these explorers. They went all the way to South America and there established their more stable existence. And from there, South America, Mesoamerica, North America was gradually expanded into that area?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and did North America and Central America, and the very first wave made it all the way down to South America and got isolated there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Isolated.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then mixed in with the next groups that came.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those guys on that island. We'll leave them be.\" So now it looks like that's the heart of Celtic tradition, but actually it's the fringe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if it is 60,000 years ago, these are really early humans?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>date of 40,000 years.\" But I think we're going to come back around to start readdressing some of these based on new evidence at hand.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And that's the interesting thing. The early human spread throughout the world and then, like you said, perhaps have gotten isolated, and then civilizations sprung from there, and they all have similar elements even though they were isolated. That's really interesting. That's really interesting that there's multiple cradles of civilization, not just one. One good idea, those ideas naturally come up. Those structures naturally come up.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>theory of parallel human development, that humans across the universe go through certain stages of development and that, that could be the answer to it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Which one do you lean on?

And it was not an Egyptian pyramid, but it was a pyramid and it was thousands of years before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is the motivation to build a pyramid?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>clay, then it will really not smell.\" I really think that the very first pyramids in Peru were about trash management. Talk about deflating, huh?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. But then they probably saw it and they were impressed and humbled by the enormity of the construction, and they were like, maybe the next guy thought, \"Maybe we should keep building these kinds of things.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>but it's full of bodies. And I think it's an echo of an old thing where they used to be putting bodies in shell mounds.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So where and who were the first civilizations in South America, Mesoamerica?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I really think we're making headway in this generation, and it's exciting to be part of piecing this old religion and its mythology back together.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just as since a lot of people refer to Christopher Columbus as the person who discovered America, I read that the Vikings reached North America much earlier in 1000 C.E.

But I also have a faith in human ingenuity that we humans like to create a really difficult situation and then come up with ways to get out of that difficult situation.

I am almost certain that the Maya would just gut laugh at what I think I know what they were.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder, do you ever think about what we just as a human civilization are wrong about the most?
