{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's pretty weird, isn't it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How are you going to ask, \"I want two of those.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You just don't. And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in Piraha. It's not possible, there's no words for that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Edward Gibson, or Ted, as everybody calls him. He's a psycholinguistics professor at MIT. He heads the MIT language lab that investigates why human languages look the way they do, the relationship between cultural language and how people represent, process and learn language. Also, you should have a book titled Syntax: A Cognitive Approach, published by MIT Press coming out this fall so look out for that. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Edward Gibson. When did you first become fascinated with human language?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>as to what it was I was told to do. I didn't understand what the theory was behind it, but I found it very interesting.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you look at grammar, you're almost thinking about it like a puzzle, almost a mathematical puzzle.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>interesting thing to do for a year, because it was a single year program. And then I ended up spending my whole life doing it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Fundamentally, your journey through life was one of a mathematician and a computer scientist. And then you discovered the puzzle, the problem of language, and approached it from that angle to try to understand it from that angle, almost like a mathematician or maybe even an engineer.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a real theory of things in any way. And so I just thought this seemed like an interesting area where there wasn't enough good work.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did you ever come across the philosophy angle of logic? If you think about the 80s with AI, the expert systems where you try to maybe sidestep the poetry of language and some of the syntax and the grammar and all that stuff and go to the underlying meaning that language is trying to communicate and try to somehow compress that in a computer representable way? Did you ever come across that in your studies?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is easier. And so I thought at least figuring out the forms of human language, which sounds really hard but is actually maybe more attractable.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting. You think there is a big divide, there's a gap, there's a distance between form and meaning, because that's a question you have discussed a lot with LLMs because they're damn good at form.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I think that's what they're good at, is form. And that's why they're good, because they can do form, meanings are ...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there's ... Oh, wow. It's an open question.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How close form and meaning are. We'll discuss it but to me studying form, maybe it's a romantic notion it gives you. Form is the shadow of the bigger meaning thing underlying language. Language is how we communicate ideas. We communicate with each other using language. In understanding the structure of that communication, I think you start to understand the structure of thought and the structure of meaning behind those thoughts and communication, to me. But to you, big gap.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you find most beautiful about human language? Maybe the form of human language, the expression of human language.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>know about, about 95% fit that pattern. It's about half and half, half are verb initial like English and half are verb final like Japanese.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just to clarify, verb initial is subject-verb-object.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Verb final is still subject-object-verb.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's correct. Yeah, the subject is generally first<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's so fascinating. I ate an apple, or I apple ate.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. And it's fascinating that there's a pretty even division in the world amongst those, 45%.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>ends up making dependencies shorter than if you cross them. If you cross them, you just end up ... It's possible, you can do it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mean within a language?<|eot_id|>"}

It's fascinating that you can break down a sentence into a tree and then every word is hanging onto another, is depending on it.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do not think so, I don't think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay. There's no linguist sitting there mad at this.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No. In every language, I think everyone agrees that all sentences are trees at some level.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Can I pause on that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Sure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because to me just as a layman, it is surprising that you can break down sentences in mostly all languages.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it gets used in language. That's how you decide what the category of a word is, not by the meaning but how it gets used.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How it's used. What's usually the root? Is it going to be the verb that defines the event?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Usually, usually. Yes, yes. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>If I don't say a verb, then there won't be a verb.

What if you're doing poetry and messing with stuff, then rules go out the window.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>around with a word order. Probably Russian poetry is going to be quite different from English poetry because the word order is much less constrained.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a much more extensive culture of poetry throughout the history of the last hundred years in Russia. And I always wondered why that is but it seems that there's more flexibility in the way the language is used.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>morphemes in English. There's the root, which is the verb.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>irregulars in English. The frequent ones, the common words tend to be irregular. There's many, many more low frequency words and those are regular ones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The evolution of the irregulars are fascinating because it's essentially slang that's sticky because breaking the rules.

Morphology is what, the study of morphemes?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>called infixes, where you have some general form for the root and you put stuff in the middle, you change the vowels, stuff like that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating, that's fascinating. In general, there's what, two morphemes per word? One or two, or three.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>morphology, there may be 10 morphemes on the end of a root, okay. And so there may be millions of forms of a given word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, okay. I'll ask the same question over and over, just sometimes to understand things like morphemes, it's nice to just ask the question, how do these kinds of things evolve? You have a great book studying how the cognitive processing, how language used for communication, so the mathematical notion of how effective language is for communication, what role that plays in the evolution of language. But just high level, how does a language evolve where English is two morphemes or one or two morphemes per word, and then Finnish has infinity per word. How does that happen? Is it just people ...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a really good question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>for us to convey, to process. But that's a naive view, and I don't ... I think it's probably right, it's naive and probably right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I don't know if it's naive. I think it's simple.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Simple, yeah. [inaudible 00:23:47].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think naive is an indication that's incorrect somehow. It's trivial, too simple. I think it could very well be correct. But it's interesting how sticky ... It feels like two people got together. It just feels like once you figure out certain aspects of a language that just becomes sticky and the tribe forms around that language, maybe the tribe forms first and then the language evolves. And then you just agree and you stick to whatever that is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>them just like we like them. Bright colors are great, they're beautiful, but they just don't need to talk about them, they don't have to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Probably color words is a good example of how language evolves from function, when you need to communicate the use of something, then you invent different variations. And basically you can imagine that the evolution of a language has to do with what the early tribe's doing, what problems are facing them and they're quickly figuring out how to efficiently communicate the solution to those problems, whether it's aesthetic or functional, all that stuff, running away from a mammoth or whatever. But I think what you're pointing to is that we don't have data on the evolution of language because many languages have formed a long time ago, so you don't get the chatter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not for a whole lot of ... Long-term language evolution, we don't have a lot. We have snapshots, is what we've got of current languages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You get an inkling of that from the rapid communication on certain platforms. On Reddit, there's different communities and they'll come up with different slang, usually from my perspective, driven by a little bit of humor or maybe mockery or whatever, just talking shit in different kinds of ways. And you could see the evolution of language there because I think a lot of things on the internet, you don't want to be the boring mainstream. You want to deviate from the proper way of talking. And so you get a lot of deviation, rapid deviation. Then when communities collide, you get ... Just like you said, humans adapt to it. And you could see it through the lines of humor. It's very difficult to study but you can imagine a hundred years from now, well, if there's a new language born for example, we'll get really high resolution data.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>contact, a lot of contact with French. And it became a vermedial language with no case marking. And so it became this verb initially thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's evolving.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>evolve maybe very much in 20 years, is maybe what you're talking about but over 50 and 100 years, things change a lot, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We'll now have good data on it, which is great.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But some of them will. We don't know. We certainly don't know. I think-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think if we're humble, there could be some interesting trees out there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>better. I do think there are people working on that, as you pointed out though, people working on whale speak, for instance. That's really fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you a wild out there sci-fi question. If we make contact with an intelligent alien civilization and you get to meet them, how surprised would you be about their way of communicating? Do you think you would be recognizable? Maybe there's some parallels here to when you go to the remote tribes.<|eot_id|>"}

How do you show up to a tribe and socialize? I mean, I guess colors and counting is one of the most basic things to figure out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a big part of this is that's how a lot of people know a lot of languages is they're willing to talk to other people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a tough one where you just show up knowing nothing.<|eot_id|>"}
