The theories and explanations about how did that happen, for me, this really very helpful theories for understanding the Soviet collapse. So the mobilization from below the collapse of the center, against the background of economic collapse, against the background of ideological implosion, that's how I look at the fall of the Soviet Union and that's how I look at the theories that explain that collapse.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's a story of geography, ideology, economics.

And then came back in full force in the late '80s and early '90s. So the most important story for me, this is the story of the continuing collapse of the Russian Empire and the rise of not just local nationalism, but also rise of Russian nationalism that turned out to be as a destructive force for the imperial or multi-ethnic, multinational state, as was Ukrainian nationalism or Georgian or Estonian for that matter.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You said a lot of interesting stuff there. In 1917, Bolsheviks, internationalists, how that plays with the idea of Russian Empire and so on. But first, let me ask about US influence on this. One of the ideas is that through the Cold War, that mechanism, US had major interest to weaken the Soviet Union, and therefore the collapse could be attributed to pressure and manipulation from the United States. Is there truth to that?<|eot_id|>"}

I basically treat him with great respect, but destruction of the Soviet Union was not one of those achievements. He was on the other side of that divide. But the politics, the political campaign, of course, have their own rules.

That's the outcome of the different processes of the 20th century. Look, Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time. Czechoslovakia goes through what can be called a civilized divorce, a very, very rare occurrence in the fall of multinational states.

The Russia or Russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from 1991, so there is no national republics in the Russian Federation that would have more rights than the Russian administrative units. The structure is different, the nationality policies are different, the level of Russification is much higher. So it is in many ways already a post-imperial formation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you're right about that moment in 1991, the role that Ukraine played in that, seems to be a very critical role.

Imperial projects, at least in the context of the late 20th century, they costed money. It wasn't a money-making machine as it was back in the 18th and 19th century. And the combination of all this factors led to the processes in which Ukraine's decision to go independent spelled the end to the Soviet Union. And if today anybody wants to restore, not the Soviet Union, but some form of Russian control over the post-Soviet space, Ukraine is as important today as it was back in December of 1991.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me ask you about Vladimir Putin's statement that the collapse of the Soviet Union is one of the great tragedies of history.

So for him, the biggest tragedy is not the loss of life, the biggest tragedy is the loss of the great power status or the unity of those whom he considered to be Russian nations. So at least this is my reading, this is my understanding of what is there, what is on the paper, and what is between the lines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So both the unity of the, quote, Russian Empire and the status of the superpower?<|eot_id|>"}

This is the focus of my book. And admittedly, in that particular book, I end on the 18th century before the era of nationalism. But then there are other books like Lost Kingdom, where I bring the story all the way up to today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What aspects of the 8th and 9th century the East Slavic states permeates to today that we should understand?<|eot_id|>"}

The acceptance of Christianity from Byzantium, that became a big issue that separated then Eastern Slavs from their Western neighbors, including Czechs and Poles, but united in that way to, let's say, Bulgarians or Serbs. And the beginning of the written literature, beginning in Kyiv. So all of that is considered to be part of heritage, all of that is being contested. And this debates that were academic for a long period of time, what we see now tragically are being continued on the battlefield.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What is Kyiv?

And that was the story of the first Kievan dynasty, and Kyiv as the capital of that huge empire that was going from the Baltics to today, central Ukraine, and then was trying to get through the southern Ukraine to the Black Sea, that was a major, major European state kingdom, if you want to call it, of medieval Europe. Creating a lot of tradition in terms of dynasty, in terms of language, in terms of religion, in terms of, again, historical mythology. So Kyiv is central for the nation-building myth of a number of groups in the region.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In one perspective and narrative, Kyiv is at the center of this Russian Empire. At which point does Moscow come to prominence as the center of the Russian Empire?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, the Russian Empire is a term and really creation of the 18th century.

It is included in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. So that's the moment when that destiny, the way how it was imagined by the 19th century Russian historian, was eventually fulfilled. Moscow was in control of all these lands.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To what degree are the Slavic people one people, and this is the theme that will continue throughout, I think, versus a collection of multiple peoples? Whether we're talking about the Kievan Rus or we're talking about the 19th century Russian Empire conception.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dealing with different peoples. We know that language is not everything. Americans speak a particular way of English, Australians speak a particular variant of English. But for reasons of geography, history, we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity, these are different nations and different peoples. And there are some parts of political tradition more in common, others are quite different. So the same when it comes to language, the same when it comes to political tradition, to the loyalty to the political institution, applies to Slavic nations. Again, there is nothing particularly unique about the Slavs in that regard.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote the book, The Cossack Myth: History and Nationhood in the Age of Empires. It tells the story of an anonymous manuscript called The History of the Rus. It started being circulated in the 1820s. I would love it if you can tell the story of this. This is supposedly one of the most impactful texts in history, modern history. So what's the importance of this text? What did it contain? How did it define the future of the region?<|eot_id|>"}

But it turned it, given the conditions of the time, into the claim for the special role of Cossacks as a nation, creating that this is a separate nation, Russian nation. And that is the challenge of nationalism that no empire really survived, and the Russian Empire was not an exception. So, there's a turning point when the discourse switches from loyalty based on the integration of the elites to the loyalty based on attachment to your nation, to your language, and to your culture, and to your history.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that was like the initial spark, the flame, that led to nationalist movements.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That was the beginning and the beginning that was building a bridge between the existence of the Cossack state in the 17th and 18th century that was used as a foundation for the Cossack mythology, Ukrainian national mythology, went into the Ukrainian National Anthem, and the new age and the new stage where the Cossacks were not there anymore, whether they were professors, intellectuals, students, members of the national and organizations. And it started, of course, with romantic poetry, it was started with collected folklore, and then, later goes to the political stage, and eventually the stage of mass politics.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So to you, even throughout the 20th century under Stalin, there was always a force within Ukraine that wants it to be independent.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the form of radical nationalism in the parts of Ukraine that were controlled by Poland and Romania, and part of that was also controlled by Czechoslovakia and later Hungary. So, in those parts outside of the Soviet Union, the form of the national mobilization, the key form of national mobilization, became radical nationalism. In Soviet Ukraine, it was national communism that came back in the 1960s and 1970s. And then, in the 1991, the majority of the members of the Ukrainian Parliament, who voted for independence, were members of the Communist Party. So that spirit on certain level never died.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, there's national communism and radical nationalism. Well, let me ask you about the radical nationalism, because that is a topic that comes up in the discussion of the war in Ukraine today. Can you tell me about Stepan Bandera? Who was he, this controversial far-right Ukrainian revolutionary?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>or in the German concentration camp, or in exile. But the myth of Bandera lived. And all the members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and then the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, that fought against the Soviets all the way into the early 1950s, they were called Banderites. They were called Banderites by the Soviet authorities. They were known also in that way to the local population. So, there was a faraway leader that barely was there on the spot, but whose name was attached to this movement for, really, liberation of Ukraine at that time. Again, the battle that failed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The fact that he collaborated with the Nazis sticks. From one perspective, he's considered by many to be a hero of Ukraine for fighting for the independence of Ukraine. From another perspective, coupled with the fact that there's this radical, revolutionary extremist flavor to the way he sees the world, that label just stays that he's a fascist, he's a Nazi. To what degree is this true? To what degree is it not?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>today, not by all, and probably not by the majority, but by many people in Ukraine, as a symbol of fighting against the Soviet Union and, by extension, against Russia and Russian occupation. So, his popularity grew after February 24, 2022 as a symbol of that resistance. Again, we are talking here about myth and mythology, because Bandera was not leading the fight against the Soviet occupation in Ukraine because, at that time, he was just simply not in Ukraine. He was in Germany. And you can imagine that geography mattered at that time much more than it matters today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a million questions to ask here. I think it's an important topic, because it is at the center of the claimed reason that the war continues in Ukraine. So, I would like to explore that from different angles. But just to clarify, was there a moment where Bandera chose Nazi Germany over the Red Army when the war already began? So, in the list of allegiances, is Ukraine's independence more important than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially?<|eot_id|>"}

So, there is no question that they are just classic nationalists. So, the goal is, nationalism is the principle according to which the, or at least one definition is, according to which the cultural boundaries coincide with political boundaries. So, their goal was to create political boundaries that would coincide with the geographic boundaries in the conditions of the World War II, and certainly making deals with whoever would either support, as I said, or tolerate that project of theirs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, I would love to find the line between nationalism, even extreme nationalism, and fascism and Nazism. So, for Bandera, the myth, the Bandera the person, let's look at some of the ideology of Nazism. To which degree did he hate Jews? Was he anti-Semitic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>research done that, in particularly, Italian fascism had influence on the thinking of people in that organization, including people at the top. But it is also very important to keep in mind that they call themselves nationalist and revolutionaries. And despite the fact that in 1939 and 1940 and 1941, it was very beneficial for them to declare themselves to be Ukrainian fascists and establish this bond, not just with Italy, but with Nazi Germany. They refused to do that. And then, they used to recall their independence. So, influences, yes, but clearly, it's a different type of political project.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, let me fast-forward into the future and see to which degree the myth permeates. Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?<|eot_id|>"}

I don't know answer. But that's the question that I think is interesting to answer, how Ukraine ended up to be the only country in the world, outside of Israel, who has a Jewish president who is, my at least understanding, is the most popular president in history, in terms of how his popularity goes after the election. So, this really, from my point of view, interesting questions, and again, we can certainly debate that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, just for context, the most popular far right party, 1-0.15% of the vote in 2019. This is before the war. So that's where things stood. It's unclear where they stand now. It'd be an interesting question whether it escalated and how much. What you're saying is that war in general can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups, of extremist nationalistic groups especially, like the far right. And it's interesting to see to what degree they have or have not risen to power in the shadows.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, no nationalist or nationalistic party actually crossed the barrier to get into the Parliament.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>forces, turned them from marginal forces into more central ones. We talked about Bandera and we talked about Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. They were the most marginal group in the political spectrum in Ukraine in the 1930s that one can only imagine. But World War II comes, and they become the most central group, because they also were, from the start go, they had the organization, the violence was basically one of their means, they knew how to fight. So, historically, wars indeed produced those results, so we are looking at Ukraine. We're trying to see what is happening there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Vladimir Putin in his interview with Tucker Carlson, but many times before, said that the current goal for the war in Ukraine is denazification, that the purpose of the war is denazification. Can you explain this concept of denazification as Putin sees it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was World War II, was fighting against fascism. So, once you use terms \"fascism,\" and \"Nazi,\" and \"denazification,\" suddenly people, not just start listening, they just stop analyzing. And as a propaganda tool, this is, of course, very powerful tool. In terms of to what degree this is the real goal or not, we discussed the importance of the far right in Europe and in Ukraine. So, if that's the real goal of the war probably, the war would have to start not against Ukraine, but probably against France or some other country, if you take this at face value.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there is something really interesting here, as you mentioned, because I've spoken to a lot of people in Russia, and you said analysis stops. In the West, people look at the word \"denazification\" and look at the things we've just discussed and almost think this is absurd. But when you talk to people in Russia, maybe it's deep in there somewhere, the history of World War II still reverberates through maybe the fears, maybe the pride, whatever the deep emotional history is there, it seems that the goal of denazification appears to be reasonable for people in Russia. They don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity or even the need for analysis, I guess, in this kind of word of denazification.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>close relatives in Russia, people who visited Ukraine who know that it's not taken over by nationalists and is not taken over by Nazis, but the media around them, the neighbors around them, the people at their work, basically, say one and the same thing. And we, as humans, in general, whatever our background, we are very, very, our mind is really, it's relatively easy to manipulate it, and to a degree that even family connections and even family ties don't sometimes help to maintain that ability to think and to analyze on your own to look at the facts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Putin has alluded to the Yaroslav Hunka incident in the Canadian Parliament September 2023. This man is a veteran of World War II on the Ukrainian side, and he got two standing ovations in the Canadian Parliament, but they later found out that he was part of the SS. So, can you explain on this, what are your thoughts on this? This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess, propagated throughout the region.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>item, in the current war. We're talking about 10,000-20,000 people in the Division, and we're talking about 2-3 million Ukrainians fighting in the Red Army. And again, it's not like Red Army is completely blameless in the way how it behaved in Prussia, in Germany, and so on and so forth. But it's basically, it's, again, we're going back to the story of Bandera. So, there is a period of collaboration, and that's what propaganda tries to define him by, or there is a Division Galizien by 20,000 people, and somehow it makes irrelevant the experience of 2-3 million people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, just to clarify, I think there is just a blunder on the Canadian Parliament side, the Canadian side, of not doing research of, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, they were just doing stupid shallow political stuff. Let's applaud, when Zelenskyy shows up, let's have a Ukrainian veteran, let's applaud a veteran of World War II, and then all of a sudden, you realize, well, there's actually complexities to wars. We can talk about, for example, a lot of dark aspects on all sides of World War II, the mass rape at the end of World War II by the Red Army, when they [inaudible 01:03:40] Germany. There's a lot of really dark complexity in it on all sides. So, that could be an opportunity to explore the dark complexity that some of the Ukrainians were in the SS, or Bandera, the complexities there, but I think they were doing not a complex thing. They were doing a very shallow applaud. And we should applaud veterans, of course, but in that case, they were doing it for show, for Zelenskyy and so on. So, we should clarify that the applause wasn't knowing, it wasn't for the SS. It was for Ukrainian, it was for World War II veterans, but the propaganda, or at least an interpretation from the Russian side, from whatever side, is that they were applauding the full person standing before them, which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran, but Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.<|eot_id|>"}

Another was the Minister of Defense, and then there was secretary in charge of the military industrial complex, Ministry of Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs. But the head of the KGB became really not just the member of Politbruo, but the member of that inner circle. And then the fact that on Andropov succeeds Brezhnev is also a manifestation of the power that KGB acquired really after Khrushchev in the 1970s, and then going into the 1980s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Who was more powerful, the KGB or the CIA during the Soviet Union?<|eot_id|>"}

The KGB was the organization that really had both the surveillance over the population within the Soviet Union and also the operations abroad. And its members, its leaders were members of the inner circle for making decisions. Again, from what I understand about the way how politics and decision work and decisions are made in the United States, the CIA, the chief of the CIA is not one of the decision-making group that providing information. Yeah, so I would say it's not day and night, but their power, political influence, political significance, very different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it understood how big the KGB was?

So, really institutionally it was a huge, huge mammoth. And another thing that we know we can sort of extrapolate from what we know from the Stasi archives, that the surveillance at home, the surveillance was really massive. The guess is the Soviets were not as effective and as meticulous and as scrupulous and as methodical as probably as Germans were. But that gives you a basic idea of how penetrated the entire society was.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think is important to understand about the KGB, if we want to also understand Vladimir Putin?

And they think about, my understanding, the operations abroad about foreign policy in general in terms of the KGB mindset of planning operations and executing particular operations and so on and so forth.

Ukraine preserved the democracy and the orientation of Ukraine toward integration in some form into Western and European structures, that Ukrainian democracy plus Western orientation was something. And in Russia, we see the strengthening of the autocratic regime under Putin, that if you look deeper, this are the processes that put the two countries on the collision course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, there's a division, a push and pull inside Ukraine on identity, on whether they're part of Russia or part of Europe.

But again, unlike Crimea, from what I understand, Russia was not really looking forward to taking possession of Donbas. Donbas was viewed as the way how to influence Ukraine to stop it from a drift toward the West.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Maybe you can tell me about the region of Donbas.<|eot_id|>"}

So, you see key figures in those positions at the start and the beginning, not being Russians from Ukraine, but being Russians from Russia and Russians from Moscow closely connected to the government structure and intelligence structure and so on. So, that is the start in the beginning, but the way how it exploded, the way it did was also a combination of the economic and ethno-cultural and linguistic factors.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For Putin, the war on Donbas and even in 2022 is a defensive war against what the Ukrainian government is doing against ethnically Russian people in Donbas.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>is certainly the argument. This is certainly the argument and pretext because what we see there is that there would be no, and there was no independent mobilization in Crimea either, in Crimea or in Donbas, without Russian presence. Without Russian occupation de facto of the Crimea, there would be no... And there was no before, at least in the previous five to six years, any mass mobilizations of Russians. There was none of such mobilizations in Donbas before Girkin and other people with parts of military units showed up there. So, it is an excuse. You've been to Ukraine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Mm-hmm.<|eot_id|>"}

Not that they didn't exist at all, but it would take quite an effort for you to find it, or sometimes even to hear Ukrainian language outside of the institutions or the farmer's market. That's the reality. That's the reality that is clear, that is visible. So, imagine under those conditions and context that someone is persecuting ethnic Russians or Russian speakers. One, to believe in something like that, one important precondition is never to step your foot in Ukraine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I should mention, maybe this is a good moment to mention, when I traveled to Ukraine, this is after the start of the war, you mentioned farmer's market, which is funny. Basically every single person I talked to, including the leadership, we spoke in Russian. For many of them, Russian is the more comfortable language even. And the people who spoke Ukrainian are more on the western side of Ukraine and young people that are kind of wanting to show that in an activist way that they want to fight for the independence of their country. So, I take your point. I wonder if you want to comment about language and maybe about the future of language in Ukraine. Is the future of language going to stabilize on Ukrainian or is it going to return to its traditional base of Russian language?<|eot_id|>"}

This is self-reporting, that doesn't mean that people exactly do what they believe that that's what they're supposed to do, and then return back to where it was by the year 2016 and 2017. So this dynamic can repeat itself, but given how long the war is going on, how big the impact, how big the stress is, and that the wave of the future is probably associated with younger people who are switching to Ukrainian. So my bet would be on Ukrainian language rising in prominence.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as we get closer to February of 2022, there's a few other key moments. Maybe let's talk about in July 2021, Putin publishing an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians. Can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pre-1917, but pre-1945. When the Russians go to pre-Bolshevik past, looking for the ideas, looking for inspiration, looking for the narratives, what they find there is empire, what they find there are imperial projects. And that's certainly the story of Putin's claim, that's the story of the argument. And to conclude the argument that he lays out there, historical argument, comes also almost directly from the narratives of the late 19s and the beginning of the 20th century. So it's not only the argument is coming from that era, but also the argumentation is coming from that era as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But those arguments are all in the flavor of empire.<|eot_id|>"}

And he started his career as a very promising Georgian writer, writing in Georgian. So he's not doing that for some personal affinity or cultural intellectual roots within Russian nation or Russian people. He is doing that for the sake of the success of his Soviet and communist project. And he has to get the largest ethnic group on board, which are Russians. But Stalin and Putin have different understanding who Russians are. Stalin already accepted Ukrainians and Belarusians, their existence Putin goes back to pre-Stalin and pre-Lenin times.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if we step back from the historical context of this and maybe the geopolitical purpose of writing such an essay, and forget about the essay altogether. I have family in Ukraine and Russia. I know a lot of people in Ukraine and Russia. Forget the war, forget all of this, they all sound the same. If I go to France, they sound different than in Ukraine and Russia. If you lay out the cultural map of the world, there's just a different beat, and music, and flavor to a people. What I'm trying to say is there seems to be a closeness between the cultures of Ukraine and Russia. How do we describe that? Do we acknowledge that and how does that add tension with the national independence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the same people, but the majority believed that they're certainly close culturally and historically nations. And from that point of view the bombardment of the Ukrainian cities became such a shock to the Ukrainians. Because deep down they maybe looked at Syria, they looked at Chechnya, and were explaining that through the fact that there was basically such a big cultural gap and difference between Russians and those countries and those nations. But my understanding at least, most of them had difficulty imagining the war of that proportion and that ferocity, and bring that war crimes and on that level.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's interesting you say that in the DNA of Ukraine versus Russia.

That the Ukrainian armed forces even before the start of this war had the highest support and popularity in Ukraine. The state today functions unbelievably effectively under attacks and missile attacks, and against city government and local government. And we are witnessing when it comes to Ukraine, we're witnessing a very important historical development where Ukrainians found their state for the first time through most of their history, and try to make a transition from successful rebels to successful managers and state builders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I talked to John Mearsheimer recently, there's a lot of people that believe NATO had a big contribution to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that was the primary cause of the war. And what we see also we talked about Tucker's interview, he was surprised, but he believed that Putin was completely honest when the first 25 minutes of interview he was talking about relations between Russia and Ukraine, was talking about history. And that was also the main focus of his essay. Essay was not on NATO and Russia, his essay was on Russia and Ukraine. So that is where the real causes are. The broader context is the fall of empire and process of disintegration of empire, not the story of NATO.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What was to clarify the reason Putin, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>drift of Ukraine toward the west and outside of the Russian sphere of influence. The invasion of 2022 perceived the same goals, keeping Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence. Once we have the resistance, quite effective resistance on the part of Ukraine, the Rammstein and coalition, international coalition in support of Ukraine. Then we see the realization of plan B, where parts of Ukrainian territory are being annexed and included in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. So the two scenarios don't exclude each other, but if scenario number one doesn't work, then scenario number two goes into play.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In the Gates of Kiev chapter, you write about Volodymyr Zelensky in the early days of the war.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the most difficult times and days. And speaking about Zelensky, every I understand reasonable leader in the West was trying to convince him to leave Ukraine and to set a government in exile in Poland or in London. And it was reasonable to accept one of his predecessors Mr. Yanukovych fled Kiev. A few months before that in Afghanistan, the president of Afghanistan fled Afghanistan. That was a reasonable thing to expect, and he turned out to be very, very unreasonable in that sense. That comes with the guts, his guts and guts people around him and Ukrainians in general.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why do you think he stayed in Kiev, this former comedian who played a president on TV, when Kiev is being invaded by the second most powerful military in the world?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those things was that if he a president and he is in the presidential office, he is there to play his role to the end. And another thing, my personal, again, I never met Volodymyr Zelensky. My personal understanding of him is that he has talent that helped him in his career before the presidency and then helps now. He feels the audience, and then channels the attitude of the audience and amplifies it. And I think that another reason why he didn't leave Kiev was that he felt the audience, the audience in that particular context for the Ukrainians.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So he had a sense that the Ukrainians would unify. Because he was quite if you look at the polls before the war, quite unpopular.

He won with 73% of the population of those who took part in the elections, his predecessor Petro Poroshenko also carried 90% of the precincts. And the same happened with Zelensky. So the country unified after 2014, to a degree it was impossible to imagine before. And Zelensky felt that Zelensky knew that, and that's where the talent of politician really matters. That's something that you can see beyond just data, and you can feel that apparently Yeltsin had that ability.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Why did the peace talks fail? There was a lot of peace talks.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that Russia will come back tomorrow and will take over everything. And once Ukrainians realize that they can win on the battlefield, once the Russians were defeated and withdrew from Kiev, the opportunity emerged to get out of the negotiations, which was very clear were leading, if not today then tomorrow to the complete destruction of Ukraine. And then of course, once the territory started to be liberated, things like butcher and massacres of the civilian population came to the fore, which made also very difficult, if not impossible to conduct negotiations from this moral and emotional point of view.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the claims that Boris Johnson, the West compromised the ability of these peace talks to be successful, basically manipulated the talks?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>answer, and I'll tell you why. Because it is very difficult for me to imagine President Zelensky to take orders from anybody in the world. Either whether it is Johnson or Joe Biden or anybody else, and basically doing things that Zelensky believes are not in his interest or in the interest of his country. I just can't imagine that anybody in the world telling Zelensky what to do, and Zelensky actually following it against his own wishes and desires. At least if that is possible, what is in the public's sphere doesn't allow us to suggest that it is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, Zelensky is a smart man and he knows that the war can only continue with the West's support.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That is a different supposition to know that it can continue with the West's support. But if talking about withdrawing from the negotiations, that's not about the continuation of the war, that you don't need Western support.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, what I mean is if he started to sense that the West will support no matter what, then maybe the space of decisions you're making is different.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>came only in late April is the Rammstein, so at least a few weeks later. So I don't know how much Boris Johnson could promise, he probably could promise to try to help and try to convince and try to work on that. If Zelensky acted on that promise he certainly was taking a risk. But the key issue, again, I'm going back where I started, it's principle unacceptance for Ukraine the conditions that were offered. And Ukraine was the moment they saw the possibility that they could fight back with Johnson's support, without Johnson's support they took the chance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what are the ways this war can end, do you think? What are the different possible trajectories, whether it's peace talks? What does winning look like for you this side? What is the role of US? What trajectories do you see that are possible?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>since Korean War. And we know that the Korean war ended in this division of Korea, but the negotiations were going on for more than two years. While those negotiations were going on, both sides were trying to improve their position there. And until there was a political change, death of Stalin, rival of Eisenhower in the United States, and the realization that the chances of succeeding on the battlefield are huge, the peace talks didn't come. So at this point, all three scenarios are possible. I don't really discount any of them. It's early to say what will happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So without any political change, let's try to imagine what are the possibilities that the war ends this year? Is it possible that it can end with compromise basically at the place it started?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Meaning back to the borders of 2022.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Back to the borders of '22, with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees, but are hopeful guarantees.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tied up not only for Putin himself, but also for his possible successors. So that means that no return to the borders of 2022 without political change in Moscow are possible. A few days after that decision in Moscow, Zelensky issued a decree saying that no negotiations with Russia. What that really meant in plain language is that basically, we're not prepared to negotiate a stable agreement with five oblasts, not just the next, but also included into the Russian constitution. So that's where we are, so that scenario, again, everything is possible of course, but it's highly, highly unlikely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the Russian constitution is a thing that makes this all very difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and not only as a negotiation tactic for Putin or whoever would negotiate on the Russian side, but also as a legal issue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the practical aspect of it even is difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. You really have to change the Constitution before the peace agreement takes hold or immediately after that. And with the Minsk agreements, that was one of things that Russia wanted from Ukraine, change of the Constitution, and it turned out to be rarely impossible. So that's one of the backstories of the Minsk and collapse of the Minsk agreements.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something like Minsk agreements that are possible now, maybe this is a legal question, but to override the Constitution to sort of shake everything up? So see the constitutional amendment as just a negotiation tactic to come to the table to something like Minsk agreement?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Given how fast those amendments to the Constitution were adopted, that suggests that really, executive power in Russia has enormous power over the legislative branch. So it's again difficult to imagine, but technically this is possible, again, but possible if there is a political change in Moscow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't understand why assuming political change in Moscow is not possible this year, so I'm trying to see if there's a way to end this war this year. Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There is a possibility of armistice, right? But armistice more like any armistice, along the lines of the current front lines. But withdrawal of the Russian troops to the borders of 2022 at this point, whether it's reasonable or unreasonable, can be achieved all only as the result of the defeat of the Russian army like it happened near Kiev. Is it possible? Possible. Is it likely, especially given what is happening with the Western support, military support for Ukraine? Probably not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But if Putin, the executive branch has a lot of power, why can't the United States president, the Russian president, the Ukrainian president come to the table and drop something like Minsk agreements, and then rapid constitutional changes made and you go back to the borders of before 2022?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Certainly not this year. I look at this year as the time when at least one side, Russian side, will try to get as much as it can through military means.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But that's been happening last year too. There's been a counteroffensive, there's attempts.<|eot_id|>"}

The biggest change of the last year was Ukraine victory on the Black Sea, where they pushed the Russian Navy into the western part of the pond and restored the grain corridor and export from Odessa, apparently up to 75% of what it used to be before the war. So that's the only major change but again, the price is enormous in terms of wealth, especially in terms of lives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So thinking about what 2024 brings, Zelensky just fired Ukraine's head of the army, a man you've mentioned, General Valery Zaluzhny.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the leadership or this is also the change of his approach to the war, and that can mean many things. One, can mean him taking more active part in planning operations. It can mean also possible change of the tactic in the war, given that counteroffensive didn't work out. We don't know yet. I don't know whether President Zelensky at this point knows exactly what will come next, but this is the time when the change of the leadership in the country and in the army that is at war, it's one of the most trying, most dangerous moments.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the thing that President Zelensky expressed is that this is going to be a change of tactics, making the approach more technologically advanced, those kind of things. But as you said, I believe he is less popular than the chief of the army, Zaluzhny, 80% to 60% depending on the polls. Do you think it's possible that Zelensky's days are numbered as the president and that somebody like Zaluzhny comes to power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they're numbered, but if Ukraine stays a democracy, and I believe it'll stay, what comes to my mind is the story of Churchill, the story of de Gaulle. In Poland, the story of Pilsudski. So once the war is over, really the electorate in the Democratic elections, they want to change the political leadership, they want to move forward. But Pilsudski came back to power, and de Gaulle came back to power, and Churchill came back to power. So no, whatever happens in the short run or medium term run, I think that Zelensky's days in politics are not numbered.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what to you is interesting?

Whatever skills you had or people around that can help, is that already gone?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. The people that surround you are not providing the kind of critical feedback necessary for democratic system. One of the things that Tucker said after his interview with Putin, he was just in his hotel just chatting on video, and he said that he felt like Putin was not very good at explaining himself, like a coherent, whole narrative of why the invasion happened or just this big picture. And he said that's not because he doesn't have one, but it's been a long time since he's had somebody around him where he has to explain himself to so he's out of practice, which is very interesting. It's a very interesting point. And that's what war and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do. So on that topic, if you had a chance to talk to Putin, what kind of questions would you ask him? What would you like to find out about the man as he stands today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>him or I don't expect the answer that can help. For example, a good question, whether you regret or not the start of the war in '22, given the enormous, enormous casualties on both sides. But you can't expect from a politician an honest answer to this question. Right? So there are questions to which I know he can't answer honestly, and then there are other questions to which I think already provided all answers that he could. So what for me is of interest are basically questions for a historian about the timing and the logic of particular decisions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I do wonder how different what he says publicly is from what he thinks privately, so a question about when the decision to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question to give insight to the difference between how he thinks about the world privately versus what he says publicly. And same about empire is if you ask Putin, he will say he has no interest in empire and he finds the notion silly, but at the same time, perhaps privately there's a sense in which he does seek the reunification of the Russian Empire.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not in the form of the Russian Empire, not in the form of the Soviet Union, but certainly in some form of the Russian control. For me at least, it's quite clear, otherwise there would be no busts to the Russian emperors and Catherine and Peter and others.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote in your book titled The Frontline: Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present about the Russian question, I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn first in 1994. Solzhenitsyn of course is the year of The Gulag Archipelago, he's half Ukrainian. What is the Russian question?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he was a Russian nationalist, but he was thinking about Russian nation state as the state of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians. And once the Soviet Union collapsed and his idea was not implemented in the 1990s, he formulated plan B, taking over by Russia of Donbas, Crimea, and southern Ukraine, the areas that now are included in the Russian constitution. So in historical terms and intellectual terms, what is happening today in the war between Russia and Ukraine is the vision on one level or another level that was formulated by the noble laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, half Russian, half Ukrainian.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If there is such a thing, what would you say is the Ukrainian question as we stand today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Ukrainian question is very simple. Now it's not anymore acquisition of the nation state, but actually a sovereign state. But it's maintenance, so the Ukrainian question is like dozens of other questions in the 20th and 21st century, the rise of the new state. And that's what is the Ukrainian question, whether Ukraine will continue to its existence as a nation, as an independent state, because that existence has been questioned by stating that Russians and Ukrainians so on are the same people, which de facto is saying your guy is Russian and also trying to destroy the state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is it possible that if the war in Ukraine continues for many more years, that the next leader that follows Zelensky would take Ukraine away from a democratic western style nation towards a more authoritarian one, maybe even with a far right influence, this kind of direction because of the influence of war?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>scenario would go against the grain of largest part of Ukrainian history. Where Ukraine really emerged as a pluralistic state on which the elements of democracy were built in the last 30 years would go against the grain of the Ukrainian society where, as one author formulated in the 1990s, he wrote a book, Ukrainian Nationalism: A Minority Faith, where the nationalist was a minority faith. And radical nationalism continues to be or at least continued to be in 2019 a minority faith during the last elections. So possible, but unlikely given the historical realities of the last 30+ years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I could talk to you for many more hours on Chernobyl alone, since you've written a book on Chernobyl and nuclear disaster. There's just a million possible conversations here, but let me just jump around history a little bit. Back before World War II, my grandmother lived through Holodomor and World War II, Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Holodomor, what do you learn let's say about human nature and about governments and nations from the fact that Holodomor happened? And maybe you could say what it is and why it happened?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we are free of that. That at least in those terms, history came to and end. That what is ahead is the future and nothing of that sort. What happened would take place to a degree that people would get in trouble for comparing any statements or events that happening today with the communism or fascism. And so I feel responsibility of myself and as a historian in particular for not doing a better job about telling people that, \"Well, we are who we are and we have as humans our dark side and we have to be very careful.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there is a human capacity to be captured by an idea, an ideology that claims to bring up a better world as the Nazis did, as Soviet Union did. And on the path of doing that, devaluing human life, that we will bring a better world. And if millions of people have to be tortured on the way to that, all right, but at least we have a better world and human beings are able to if not accept it, look the other way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. And in the name of a particular nation or race, like it was the Third Reich or in the name of the humanity of the future. So not just devalue human life, destroy human life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something fundamental about communism and centralized planning that's part of the problem here? Maybe this also connects to the story of Chernobyl, where the Chernobyl disaster is not just a story of failure of a nuclear power plant, but it's an entire institution of the scientific and nuclear institution, but the entirety of the government.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>over the issue of national autonomy. It started under the slogans, \"Tell us the truth about Chernobyl. We want to know whether we live in contaminated areas or not.\" And that was a very, very strong factor that crossed, not just ethnic religious linguistic lines, lines between members of the party and not members of the party of the topSS leadership and not in military and civilian because it turned out that the party card didn't protect you from being affected by radiation. So the all national mobilization happens. The first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl, not about anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating. For people who might not know, Chernobyl is located in Ukraine. It's a fascinating view that Chernobyl might be one of the critical threshold catalysts for the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's very interesting. Just as a small aside, I guess this is a good moment to give some love to the HBO series. Even though it's British accents and so on, it made me realize that some of these stories in Eastern Europe could be told very effectively through film, through series. It's so incredibly well done. And maybe I can ask you. Historically speaking, were you impressed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>necessary. You see the Soviet boss threatening someone to throw the person from the helicopter. So you get these Hollywood sort of things despite the fact that it's HBO series. And they're the best really as a film in the fourth episode where they completely decided just to hell with the reality and let's make a film. So they bring Legasov, one of the key characters, to the court meetings. They bring Soviet party boss, Shcherbina, he wasn't there. They created drama there. So they got the main thing, the big truth right, and that's why I like this production.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sometimes to show what something felt like you have to go bigger than it actually was. If you... I don't know. If you experience heartbreak and you see a film about it, you want there to be explosions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>people of my generation who were there, knew that and recognized that. But for new generation, whether they are in Ukraine and Russia, in US, in Britain, in Zimbabwe, anywhere, you have do these little untruths and introduce them. And I had a very interesting on-air conversation with the author of the script, Mazin, and I asked him the question of the film declared really the importance of the truth, but how do you square that with the need in the film, to really put it mildly, to go beyond the measures of truth, whatever understanding of that term is?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying that some of the most dramatic moments in history are probably quite mundane. The decisions to begin wars, invasions, they're probably something like a Zoom meeting on a random Tuesday in today's workplace. So it's not like there's dramatic music playing. These are just human decisions and they command armies and they command destruction. I personally, because of that, believe in the power of individuals to be able to stop wars, not just start wars, individual leaders. So let me just ask about nuclear safety because there's an interesting point you make. You wrote in the book in Atoms and Ashes: A Global History of Nuclear Disasters, so technically nuclear energy is extremely safe. If there's a number of people died per energy generated, it's much safer than coal oil, for example, as far as I understand. But the case you also make is you write, quote, \"Many of the political, economic, social and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past are still with us today, making the nuclear industry vulnerable to repeating old mistakes in new and unexpected ways and any new accidents are certain to create new anti-nuclear mobilization.\" And then you continue with, \"This makes the nuclear industry not only risky to operate, but also impossible to count on as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem.\" Can you explain that perspective? It's an interesting one, speaking to the psychology when an accident does happen, it has a dramatic effect. And also speaking to the fact that accidents can happen, not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant, but of the underlying structure of government that oversees it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>happens, the reaction is in China to that as well. They're very much concerned. So there is a saying in the field, \"Anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere.\" After Fukushima, Germany decides to go nuclear-free and gets there at the expense of burning coal. So that's how we react. And each major accident, that means global freeze on the nuclear reactor production for at least another 10 years. So that's what I mean that nuclear industry is politic, not just in terms of technology and not just in terms of radiation, impact on health, but also politically a very, very unreliable option.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to you, you suspect that's an irreparable aspect of human nature in the human mind that there are certain things that just create a kind of panic, invisible threats of this kind. Whether it's a virus or radiation. There's something about the mind, if I get a stomach ache in the United States after Fukushima, I kind of think it's probably radiation, this kind of irrational type of thinking. And that's not possible to repair?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we can be trained. We can be trained.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pretty smart, aren't we? Education.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But generally, we are afraid of things that we see, but even more, we're afraid of things that we don't see and radiation is one of those.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's zoom out on the world. We talked about the war in Ukraine. How does the war in Ukraine change the world order? Let me just look at everything that's going on. Zoom out a bit. China, the Israel-Gaza war, the Middle East, India. What is interesting to you, important to think about, in the coming years and decades?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back to the time of the Cold War and the bipolar world that emerges, it's not anymore the world focused on Washington and Moscow. It's more like world focused on Washington and Beijing. And then there are countries in between. There are countries in between that join one bloc or another bloc that is emerging that is not fully formed. This, in my opinion, makes the task of us historians to really go back to the Cold War and look through new perspective on the history of that conflict because there is a lot of things that we can learn.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some ways, history does repeat itself here. So now it's a cold war with China and the United States. What's a hopeful trajectory for the 21st century for the rest of it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that for now more than 70 years, we don't have a world war? How come that after World War I, World War II came within 20 years? What helped us to keep the world on the brink, but still away from the global war for such a long period of time? How to keep the Cold War cold. That's the biggest lesson that the history of the Cold War can give us. And I don't think we ask the question quite often enough, ask the question that way. And if you don't ask right questions, we don't get right answers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you've written a book, a great book on the Cuban Missile crisis. We came very close, not to just another world war, but to a nuclear war and the destruction of human civilization as we know it. So I guess it's a good question to ask, what did we do so right? And maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky. And the question is how do we keep getting lucky?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>get the order or missed things that was happening on the American side as well. So people who believe that they're in control really are not in control, and that can escalate whether they very often against their wishes. So that is one lesson, but going back to what we're still here and why the world didn't end up in 1962 is that the leadership, and I come to the issue that you strongly believe in that people, personalities matter, leaders matter. They were very different. Age, education, political careers, understanding what politics are and so on and so forth.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You mean Khrushchev?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>on Cuba, but the crisis was resolved and we didn't end in the third World War because of the nuclear weapons, because people, leaders were afraid of them. And that's where I want to put emphasis. It's not that the nuclear weapons created crisis or solved the crisis, it's basically our perception of them. And we are now in the age after the Cold War era, with the new generation of voters, with the new generation of politicians. We don't belong to the generation of bikini atoll. You maybe know what bikini is, but we think that this is something-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a different thing. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

And it's very important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's so fascinating how that fades into memory, that the power and the respect and fear of the power of nuclear weapons just fades into memory. And then we may very well make the same mistakes again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, we can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Another leader said that, I believe, but about a totally different topic.
