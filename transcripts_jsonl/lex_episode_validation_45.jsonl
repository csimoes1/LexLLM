In 1917, Bolsheviks, internationalists, how that plays with the idea of Russian Empire and so on. But first, let me ask about US influence on this.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>just simply not in Ukraine. He was in Germany. And you can imagine that geography mattered at that time much more than it matters today.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a million questions to ask here. I think it's an important topic, because it is at the center of the claimed reason that the war continues in Ukraine. So, I would like to explore that from different angles. But just to clarify, was there a moment where Bandera chose Nazi Germany over the Red Army when the war already began? So, in the list of allegiances, is Ukraine's independence more important than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the conditions of the World War II, and certainly making deals with whoever would either support, as I said, or tolerate that project of theirs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, I would love to find the line between nationalism, even extreme nationalism, and fascism and Nazism.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They refused to do that. And then, they used to recall their independence. So, influences, yes, but clearly, it's a different type of political project.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, let me fast-forward into the future and see to which degree the myth permeates. Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of how his popularity goes after the election. So, this really, from my point of view, interesting questions, and again, we can certainly debate that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, just for context, the most popular far right party, 1-0.15% of the vote in 2019. This is before the war. So that's where things stood. It's unclear where they stand now. It'd be an interesting question whether it escalated and how much. What you're saying is that war in general can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups, of extremist nationalistic groups especially, like the far right. And it's interesting to see to what degree they have or have not risen to power in the shadows.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So, no nationalist or nationalistic party actually crossed the barrier to get into the Parliament.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>knew how to fight. So, historically, wars indeed produced those results, so we are looking at Ukraine. We're trying to see what is happening there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Vladimir Putin in his interview with Tucker Carlson, but many times before, said that the current goal for the war in Ukraine is denazification, that the purpose of the war is denazification. Can you explain this concept of denazification as Putin sees it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>probably, the war would have to start not against Ukraine, but probably against France or some other country, if you take this at face value.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, there is something really interesting here, as you mentioned, because I've spoken to a lot of people in Russia, and you said analysis stops. In the West, people look at the word \"denazification\" and look at the things we've just discussed and almost think this is absurd. But when you talk to people in Russia, maybe it's deep in there somewhere, the history of World War II still reverberates through maybe the fears, maybe the pride, whatever the deep emotional history is there, it seems that the goal of denazification appears to be reasonable for people in Russia. They don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity or even the need for analysis, I guess, in this kind of word of denazification.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>connections and even family ties don't sometimes help to maintain that ability to think and to analyze on your own to look at the facts.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, Putin has alluded to the Yaroslav Hunka incident in the Canadian Parliament September 2023. This man is a veteran of World War II on the Ukrainian side, and he got two standing ovations in the Canadian Parliament, but they later found out that he was part of the SS. So, can you explain on this, what are your thoughts on this? This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess, propagated throughout the region.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>tries to define him by, or there is a Division Galizien by 20,000 people, and somehow it makes irrelevant the experience of 2-3 million people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, just to clarify, I think there is just a blunder on the Canadian Parliament side, the Canadian side, of not doing research of, maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, they were just doing stupid shallow political stuff. Let's applaud, when Zelenskyy shows up, let's have a Ukrainian veteran, let's applaud a veteran of World War II, and then all of a sudden, you realize, well, there's actually complexities to wars. We can talk about, for example, a lot of dark aspects on all sides of World War II, the mass rape at the end of World War II by the Red Army, when they [inaudible 01:03:40] Germany. There's a lot of really dark complexity in it on all sides. So, that could be an opportunity to explore the dark complexity that some of the Ukrainians were in the SS, or Bandera, the complexities there, but I think they were doing not a complex thing. They were doing a very shallow applaud. And we should applaud veterans, of course, but in that case, they were doing it for show, for Zelenskyy and so on. So, we should clarify that the applause wasn't knowing, it wasn't for the SS. It was for Ukrainian, it was for World War II veterans, but the propaganda, or at least an interpretation from the Russian side, from whatever side, is that they were applauding the full person standing before them, which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran, but Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nevertheless, it had a lot of power and really reverberated in support of the narrative that there is a neo-Nazi, a Nazi problem in Ukraine.<|eot_id|>"}

And Ukraine was the moment they saw the possibility that they could fight back with Johnson's support, without Johnson's support they took the chance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what are the ways this war can end, do you think? What are the different possible trajectories, whether it's peace talks? What does winning look like for you this side? What is the role of US? What trajectories do you see that are possible?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>didn't come. So at this point, all three scenarios are possible. I don't really discount any of them. It's early to say what will happen.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So without any political change, let's try to imagine what are the possibilities that the war ends this year? Is it possible that it can end with compromise basically at the place it started?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Meaning back to the borders of 2022.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Back to the borders of '22, with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees, but are hopeful guarantees.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, and not only as a negotiation tactic for Putin or whoever would negotiate on the Russian side, but also as a legal issue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the practical aspect of it even is difficult.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Constitution, and it turned out to be rarely impossible.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the legislative branch. So it's again difficult to imagine, but technically this is possible, again, but possible if there is a political change in Moscow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't understand why assuming political change in Moscow is not possible this year, so I'm trying to see if there's a way to end this war this year. Right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>happened near Kiev. Is it possible? Possible. Is it likely, especially given what is happening with the Western support, military support for Ukraine? Probably not.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But if Putin, the executive branch has a lot of power, why can't the United States president, the Russian president, the Ukrainian president come to the table and drop something like Minsk agreements, and then rapid constitutional changes made and you go back to the borders of before 2022?

There's been a counteroffensive, there's attempts.<|eot_id|>"}

So that's the only major change but again, the price is enormous in terms of wealth, especially in terms of lives.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So thinking about what 2024 brings, Zelensky just fired Ukraine's head of the army, a man you've mentioned, General Valery Zaluzhny. What do you make of this development?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the change of the leadership in the country and in the army that is at war, it's one of the most trying, most dangerous moments.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the thing that President Zelensky expressed is that this is going to be a change of tactics, making the approach more technologically advanced, those kind of things. But as you said, I believe he is less popular than the chief of the army, Zaluzhny, 80% to 60% depending on the polls. Do you think it's possible that Zelensky's days are numbered as the president and that somebody like Zaluzhny comes to power?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>back to power. So no, whatever happens in the short run or medium term run, I think that Zelensky's days in politics are not numbered.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what to you is interesting? For example, if I get a chance to interview Zelensky, what to you is interesting about the person that would be good to ask about, to explore about, the state of his mind, his thinking, his view of the world as it stands today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to basically suggest that that's the way to go, but I would be very much interested to hear what is his thinking about that is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you think there's a degree during wartime that the power that comes with being a war president can corrupt the person, sort of push you away from the democratic mindset towards an authoritarian one?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>do that easier and in more effective way, or should I do the right way? That's the challenge. Sometimes it's difficult to answer this question.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me stay in power for just a little longer to do it the efficient way, and then time flies away and all of a sudden you're going for the third term and the fourth term.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to realize that actually, you can't control in any other way. Whatever skills you had or people around that can help, is that already gone?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly. The people that surround you are not providing the kind of critical feedback necessary for democratic system. One of the things that Tucker said after his interview with Putin, he was just in his hotel just chatting on video, and he said that he felt like Putin was not very good at explaining himself, like a coherent, whole narrative of why the invasion happened or just this big picture. And he said that's not because he doesn't have one, but it's been a long time since he's had somebody around him where he has to explain himself to so he's out of practice, which is very interesting. It's a very interesting point. And that's what war and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do. So on that topic, if you had a chance to talk to Putin, what kind of questions would you ask him? What would you like to find out about the man as he stands today?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that he could. So what for me is of interest are basically questions for a historian about the timing and the logic of particular decisions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I do wonder how different what he says publicly is from what he thinks privately, so a question about when the decision to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question to give insight to the difference between how he thinks about the world privately versus what he says publicly. And same about empire is if you ask Putin, he will say he has no interest in empire and he finds the notion silly, but at the same time, perhaps privately there's a sense in which he does seek the reunification of the Russian Empire.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Russian control. For me at least, it's quite clear, otherwise there would be no busts to the Russian emperors and Catherine and Peter and others.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You wrote in your book titled The Frontline: Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present about the Russian question, I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn first in 1994.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Russia and Ukraine is the vision on one level or another level that was formulated by the noble laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, half Russian, half Ukrainian.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If there is such a thing, what would you say is the Ukrainian question as we stand today?<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>continued to be in 2019 a minority faith during the last elections. So possible, but unlikely given the historical realities of the last 30+ years.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I could talk to you for many more hours on Chernobyl alone, since you've written a book on Chernobyl and nuclear disaster. There's just a million possible conversations here, but let me just jump around history a little bit. Back before World War II, my grandmother lived through Holodomor and World War II, Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Holodomor, what do you learn let's say about human nature and about governments and nations from the fact that Holodomor happened? And maybe you could say what it is and why it happened?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>about telling people that, \"Well, we are who we are and we have as humans our dark side and we have to be very careful.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there is a human capacity to be captured by an idea, an ideology that claims to bring up a better world as the Nazis did, as Soviet Union did. And on the path of doing that, devaluing human life, that we will bring a better world. And if millions of people have to be tortured on the way to that, all right, but at least we have a better world and human beings are able to if not accept it, look the other way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>like it was the Third Reich or in the name of the humanity of the future. So not just devalue human life, destroy human life.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there something fundamental about communism and centralized planning that's part of the problem here? Maybe this also connects to the story of Chernobyl, where the Chernobyl disaster is not just a story of failure of a nuclear power plant, but it's an entire institution of the scientific and nuclear institution, but the entirety of the government.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>didn't protect you from being affected by radiation. So the all national mobilization happens. The first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl, not about anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's fascinating. For people who might not know, Chernobyl is located in Ukraine. It's a fascinating view that Chernobyl might be one of the critical threshold catalysts for the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's very interesting. Just as a small aside, I guess this is a good moment to give some love to the HBO series. Even though it's British accents and so on, it made me realize that some of these stories in Eastern Europe could be told very effectively through film, through series. It's so incredibly well done. And maybe I can ask you. Historically speaking, were you impressed?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Shcherbina, he wasn't there. They created drama there. So they got the main thing, the big truth right, and that's why I like this production.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Sometimes to show what something felt like you have to go bigger than it actually was. If you... I don't know. If you experience heartbreak and you see a film about it, you want there to be explosions.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that with the need in the film, to really put it mildly, to go beyond the measures of truth, whatever understanding of that term is?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying that some of the most dramatic moments in history are probably quite mundane. The decisions to begin wars, invasions, they're probably something like a Zoom meeting on a random Tuesday in today's workplace. So it's not like there's dramatic music playing. These are just human decisions and they command armies and they command destruction. I personally, because of that, believe in the power of individuals to be able to stop wars, not just start wars, individual leaders. So let me just ask about nuclear safety because there's an interesting point you make. You wrote in the book in Atoms and Ashes: A Global History of Nuclear Disasters, so technically nuclear energy is extremely safe. If there's a number of people died per energy generated, it's much safer than coal oil, for example, as far as I understand. But the case you also make is you write, quote, \"Many of the political, economic, social and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past are still with us today, making the nuclear industry vulnerable to repeating old mistakes in new and unexpected ways and any new accidents are certain to create new anti-nuclear mobilization.\" And then you continue with, \"This makes the nuclear industry not only risky to operate, but also impossible to count on as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem.\" Can you explain that perspective? It's an interesting one, speaking to the psychology when an accident does happen, it has a dramatic effect. And also speaking to the fact that accidents can happen, not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant, but of the underlying structure of government that oversees it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>politic, not just in terms of technology and not just in terms of radiation, impact on health, but also politically a very, very unreliable option.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And to you, you suspect that's an irreparable aspect of human nature in the human mind that there are certain things that just create a kind of panic, invisible threats of this kind. Whether it's a virus or radiation. There's something about the mind, if I get a stomach ache in the United States after Fukushima, I kind of think it's probably radiation, this kind of irrational type of thinking. And that's not possible to repair?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think we can be trained. We can be trained.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Pretty smart, aren't we? Education.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>we are afraid of things that we see, but even more, we're afraid of things that we don't see and radiation is one of those.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's zoom out on the world. We talked about the war in Ukraine. How does the war in Ukraine change the world order? Let me just look at everything that's going on. Zoom out a bit. China, the Israel-Gaza war, the Middle East, India. What is interesting to you, important to think about, in the coming years and decades?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the Cold War and look through new perspective on the history of that conflict because there is a lot of things that we can learn.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So in some ways, history does repeat itself here.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think we ask the question quite often enough, ask the question that way. And if you don't ask right questions, we don't get right answers.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you've written a book, a great book on the Cuban Missile crisis. We came very close, not to just another world war, but to a nuclear war and the destruction of human civilization as we know it. So I guess it's a good question to ask, what did we do so right? And maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky. And the question is how do we keep getting lucky?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in that people, personalities matter, leaders matter. They were very different.
