As I've said before, I will speak with everyone, including on the left and the right of the political spectrum, always in good faith, with empathy, rigor, and backbone. Sometimes I fail. Sometimes I say stupid, inaccurate, ineloquent things, and I frequently change my mind as I'm learning and thinking about the world. For all this, I often get attacked, sometimes fairly, sometimes not. But just know that I'm aware when I fall short and I will keep trying to do better. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Cenk Uygur. You wrote a book.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A manifesto that outlines the progressive vision for America. So the big question, what are some defining ideas of progressivism?<|eot_id|>"}

We don't have equal talent, skills, abilities, et cetera.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of questions I can ask there. So on the circle of liberty, yes, so expanding the number of people whose freedoms are protected. But what about the magnitude of freedom for each individual person? So expanding the freedom of the individual and protecting the freedoms of an individual. It seems like progressives are more willing to expand the size of government where government can do all kinds of regulation, all kinds of controls in the individual.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>They're all extremists in supporting what I call corporatism. So you have to get to a balance in order to get to the right answer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's an interesting distinction here. So you're actually, as far as I understand, pro-capitalism, which is an interesting place to be. That's the thing that probably makes you center-left and then still populist. You're full of beautiful contradictions, let's say this, which will be great to untangle. But what's the difference between corporatism and capitalism? Is there a difference?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>human nature, and goes, \"I don't think so. I think if you're going to leave a power vacuum, I'm going to take that power vacuum.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's actually a really interesting way to put it, because when everyone is equal, nobody is in power, and human nature is such that there's everybody [inaudible 00:10:33] that there's a will to power. So when you create a power vacuum, somebody's going to fill it. So the alternative is to have people in power, but there's a balance of power, and then there's a democratic system that elects the people in power and keeps churning and rotating who's involved.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>preposterous, it's awful, and it kills the free markets, and it's killing this country, and it is the main ideology and religion of the establishment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are all companies built the same here? So when you say corporatism, it seems like just looking here at the list by industry lobbyists, it seems like there are certain industries that are worse offenders than others, like pharmaceuticals, like insurance, oil and gas. So it seems to me it feels wrong to just throw all companies into the same bucket of they're all guilty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they have basically taken the influence they need to capture the market, capture the government, and snuff out all competition, or a lot of competition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, figured out the game better. So I think a lot of companies are good at winning the right way by building better products, by making people happier with the work they're doing and the winning at the game of capitalism. And then there's other companies that win at the game of lobbying, and I just want to draw that distinction because I think it's a small subset of companies that are playing the game of lobbying. It's like big pharma.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>course. So he gives Trump a couple of million dollars. Trump turns around the next day and goes, \"We love TikTok. TikTok's a good company.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's a big contributor to influencing what politicians say and what they think. But it's not the entire thing, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>50/50. They have principles and they have money. No, they have money and this smidge of principles. That's why I wanted to clarify 98 too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so how do we fix it? So it's really interesting and nice that you have pro-capitalism and anti-corporatism. So how do we create a system where the free market can rule. Where capitalism can rule, we can have these vibrant flourishing of all these companies competing against each other and creating awesome stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>they don't inspect it and then the elevator falls.\" So balance of reason, correct regulation to protect the markets and to protect the American people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but finding the right level of regulation, especially in, for example, in tech, something I'm much more familiar with, is very difficult because people in Congress are living in the 20th century before the internet was invented. So how are they supposed to come up with regulations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the idea of the free market, is you should be able to compete. The market regulates, and then the government can step in and protect the market from forming monopolies, for example, which is easier to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But that's a form of regulation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then there's more checking the elevator twice a year. That's a more sort of specific watching, micromanaging.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't want it to swing too wildly, but you do need a little bit of oscillation in that pendulum to get to the right balance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, I was listening to Joe Biden from when he was like 30 years old, the speeches, he was eloquent as hell. It's fun to listen to actually. And he has a speech he gives or just maybe a conversation in Congress, I'm not sure where, where he talks about how corrupt the whole system is, and he's really honest and fun. And that Joe Biden was great, by the way, that guy. I mean, age sucks. People get older. But he was talking quite honestly about having to suck up to all these rich people and that he couldn't really suck up to the really rich people. They said, \"Come back to us 10 years later when you're more integrated into the system.\" But he was really honest about it, and he's saying, \"That's how it is. That's what we have to do. And that really sucks that that's what we have to do.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we did a video on our TikTok channel, then and now, of Joe Biden. This is when I was trying to push Biden out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We should say you were one of the people early on, saying Biden needs to step down.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>days before he dropped out, his inside advisors inside the White House said, \"Yeah, near 0% chance of winning.\" So we were right all along.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got a lot of criticism for that, by the way. But yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that's right. Biden, Biden, Biden, Biden, not Bernie.\" I don't know that there's anybody in the country who instinctually dislikes Bernie more than Barack Obama.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's an interesting... I'm not taking that tangent at this moment. You mentioned mainstream media. What's the motivation for mainstream media to be corporatist also?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>puts his arm around his shoulders, takes him to the big newsroom, and he goes, \"You see all this? Money in politics paid for that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really fascinating. So, big corporations, they're giving money to politicians through different channels, and then the politicians are spending that money on mainstream media. So, there's a vicious cycle where it's in the interest of the mainstream media not to criticize the very corporations that are feeding that cycle. It's not actually direct, it's not like corporations are... Because I was thinking one of the ways is direct advertisement. Pharmaceuticals obviously advertise a lot on mainstream media, but there's also indirect, which is giving the politicians money or super PACs and the super PACs and the spend money on...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>dollars from them. They never really criticized the Republican and Democratic Party. On the other hand, if you're an outsider, they'll rip your face off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's also really interesting. So, if you're an advertiser, if you're big pharma and you're advertising, it's not that the advertisement works. It's that the hosts are too afraid, not explicitly, just even implicitly. They're self-censoring. They're not going to have any guests that are controversial, anti-big pharma, or they're not going to make any jokes about big pharma. That continues and expands. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>here, and you are not allowed to go beyond acceptable thought. Acceptable thought is our sponsors are great, politicians are great, the powerful are great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do we begin to fix that, and what exactly are we fixing? Is it the influence of the lobbyists? It feels like companies have found different ways to achieve influence. So, how do we get money out of politics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>order to do it, the populist left and the populist right have to unite. By the way, that is why we have the culture wars.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why you're voting for Trump.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the whole point of capturing the Supreme Court was to make sure that they kill any piece of legislation that would protect the American people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the Supreme Court is also captured by this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to the Constitution. The best amendment gets three-quarters of the states to ratify. You go above the Supreme Court and you solve the whole thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if 93% of people want this, why hasn't it happened yet? I mean, the obvious answer is there's corporate control of the media and the politicians, but it seems like our current system and the megaphone that a president has should be able to unite the populace left and right. So, it shouldn't be that difficult to do. Why hasn't a person like Trump who's a billionaire or on the left, a rich businessman run just on this and win?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>companies and give me $1 billion and I'll give you tax subsidies. I'll let you drill. I'll take away regulation. Why would I stop that?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think he likes money more than he likes being popular?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>corruption over and over again. MAGA is like, \"I'm here for it. Love it.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that you have some popular support.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of sense. It doesn't make any goddamn sense, but they get themselves to believe it. That's another portion of the invisible hand of the market.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's problems with every path. So, the elite, like you mentioned, can be corrupted by greed, by power, and so on. But the crowd, I agree with you, by the way, about the wisdom of the crowd versus the wisdom of the elite, but the crowd can be captured by a charismatic leader. I'm probably a populist myself. The problem with populism is that it can't be and has been throughout history captured by bad people.<|eot_id|>"}

I don't want to say contradiction, but there's a tension that creates the balance. So, to me, in the way you're speaking might result in hurting capitalism. So, it is easy in fighting corporatism to hurt companies, to go too far the other way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you talk about corporate tax, so what's the magic number for the corporate tax? If it's too high, companies leave.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>want wild swings, communism, corporatism, right? You want to get to hey, where's the right balance here between capitalism and what people think is socialism?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, I guess I agree with most of the things you said about the corruption. I just wish there would be more celebration of the fact that capitalism and some incredible companies in the history of the 20th century has created so much wealth, so much innovation that has increased the quality of life on average. They've also increased the wealth inequality and exploitation of the workers and this stuff, but you want to not forget to celebrate the awesomeness that companies have also brought outside the political sphere just in creating awesome stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You can't function in a democracy and be in an extreme position and expect the rest of the country to go towards your extreme position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So why do you think we are not in a meritocracy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>okay, now we're going to run a race. And the guy who was right next to the finish line wins and they go, meritocracy. Okay?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So the challenge there is to know which disparities when you just freeze the system and observe are actually a result of some kind of discrimination or a flaw in the system versus the result of meritocracy, of the better runner being ahead.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>parts that are easy to solve, Lex.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>trust the people and you let the pendulum swing but not wildly, then you're going to get to the right answers in the long run.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you think this woke mind virus that the right refers to is a problem, but not a big problem?<|eot_id|>"}

It doesn't mean that there's larger scale issues with things like DEI that aren't so fun to talk about or viral to talk about on an anecdotal scale. DEI does create a culture of fear with cancel culture, and it does create a culture that limits the freedom of expression, and it does limit the meritocracy in another way.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay, so there's this, oh, this is a famous one, relatively. I did a joke about bestiality like a dozen years ago...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Very nice.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it, didn't look to see if it's edited or not edited. The New York Times implied that bestiality was part of my agenda.

He was being sarcastic when he said, \"Sure, you're not racist, Dave.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One of the sources of hope to all this is there's a lot of independent media now, but mainstream media has a lot of power still and carries a lot of power.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you just lost a giant chunk of your revenue. Now when your costs are higher than your revenue, nighty night, it's been nice knowing you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's going to collapse and it's going to be painful.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>can't lose text, that's so important. The TV guys are just actors. You can lose them overnight and it won't hurt you. It'll help you.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's going to be a messy battle for truth, because the reality is there's a lot of money to be made and a lot of attention to be gained from drama farming. So just constantly creating drama. And sometimes drama helps find the truth like we were mentioning, but most of the time it's just drama and it doesn't care about the truth. It just cares about drama. And then the same as conspiracy theories. Now, some conspiracy theories have value and depth, and they allow us to question the institutions, but the bottom line is conspiracy theories get clicks. And so you can just keep coming up random conspiracy theories, many of them don't have to be grounded in the truth at all. And so that's the sea we're operating in. And so it's a tricky space too.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>don't doubt that he's genuine and people can sense that. And he's huge. We're genuine, we're huge.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Here we go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I didn't actually know this, but when I was prepping for this conversation, I saw that you actually said at some point in the past that you can beat up Rogan in a fight.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, you said that you have a shot. It's a non-zero probability.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you still believe this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes. But the probability is dropping. It's dropping every day.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it's probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard you say. I wrestled and did Jiu-Jitsu and judo and all the kinds of fighting sports my whole life. And I just observed a lot of really confident, large guys roll into gyms. He's ripped, he could deadlift, he could talk all kinds of shit. And he beliefs he's going to be the next world champion and he just gets his ass kicked.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time, and he said something similar. And I'm up to hear with Joe at that point. I don't know if we'll ever talk yet, right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you've been in a show and that was a good conversation.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a great conversation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That was a while back. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I hope he has you on again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So I get it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I bet you I don't like this take you have, a lot. I bet you he hates it because him as an MMA commentator, he gets to hear so many bros.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's all about the mindset, bro. Now, to [inaudible 03:30:06], the point you're making, which I do think it's the stupidest thing you've ever said, but the actual intent, which is whether you're left or right, there's strong people on the left, mentally strong, physically strong. I think the whole point is not that you can beat them, but you are willing to fight if you need to.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A hundred percent.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's not like I believe I could beat him, it's like all this calling the people on the left wussies or whatever. I'm willing to step in the fight, even if I'm on train, even if I'm a out of shape, I'm willing to fight. Yeah, I get it. I understand that. But it's just pick a different person. That's why I wrote down my genuine curiosity is if you can beat up Alex, Alex Jones versus Cenk, the legitimate is I would pay for that. Because you're both untrained. You both got I would say, the spirit.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, no. Look, I'll give the same fairness. I think I got an 8% chance of being beating Rogan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're [inaudible 03:31:12].<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I know, I got it. Hold on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I think to be fair, Alex has an 8% chance of beating me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow. Okay.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Alex stand almost no chance, if you ask me. So first of all, it's not just because I'm big and he's big. One, I wrestled.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, you wrestled?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>not no experience, it's some experience. And the most important part of a street fight is being able to take a punch to the face.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Knowing what it feels like to get punched in the face, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the willpower I have, okay? Because to me, the idea of losing to Alex Jones is unthinkable. I would do anything not to lose, anything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let me just say, so that's beautiful. I love this. I would pay a lot of money to watch the two of you just even wrestle. But with Joe, I think I have to say, it's like it 0.0001% chance, you have a chance before you even get to the mentality. And the other thing is, on the mentality side, one of the fascinating things about Joe is he's actually a sweetheart in person, like this. But there's something that takes over him when he competes.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Brother, we've been around 22 years in the toughest industry in the world.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I understand, yeah.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Tremendous willpower. But overall, this is not the hill I'm dying on. Okay? Joe would win, I get it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think we're all allowed one kind of blind spot, I suppose.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a big guy that still is in good shape, that was a wrestler that's been on a lot of street fights, you still think 0.0001?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It depends on the street fights. But yeah, 0.001. I just see technique-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out the willpower part of blah, blah, blah. I think it's one to 2%. Yeah, he could catch the guy on about and get lucky.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it's because I've talked to... So I trained with a coach named John Donaher, and we talk about this a lot. And I think technique is the thing that also feeds the willpower. It actually builds up your confidence in the way that nothing else does in the more actionable way, because you won't need that much willpower.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If the technique is backed, you don't have to be a tough guy to win debates if you're just fucking good at debates.

One of the controversial things you've done, in the nineties as a student at UPenn, you publicly denied the Armenian Genocide, which is the mass murder of over a million Armenians in 1915 and '16 in the Ottoman Empire.

Do you think there's some value to the conspiracy theories that come from the right, but actually more so come from the anti-establishment? For me, there's a lot that raise a bit of a question. A lot of them could probably be explained by corporatism and the military industrial complex. But there's also a lot of them could be explained by creepiness and shadiness in human nature. Epstein is an example of that. There's a lot of ways to explain Epstein, including the basic creepiness of human nature. ... including the basic creepiness of human nature.
