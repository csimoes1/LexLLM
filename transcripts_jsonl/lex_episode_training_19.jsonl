You have propaganda, you have marketing. You don't have real news. When you're in the online world, it's chaotic. And don't get me wrong, it's got plenty of downsides, but within that chaos, the truth begins to emerge. Trump is a massive risk because of all the things we talked about earlier, but there is a percentage chance that he's such a wild card that he overturns the whole system, and that is why the establishment is a little scared of him.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is a conversation with Cenk Uygur, a progressive political commentator and host of The Young Turks. As I've said before, I will speak with everyone, including on the left and the right of the political spectrum, always in good faith, with empathy, rigor, and backbone. Sometimes I fail. Sometimes I say stupid, inaccurate, ineloquent things, and I frequently change my mind as I'm learning and thinking about the world. For all this, I often get attacked, sometimes fairly, sometimes not. But just know that I'm aware when I fall short and I will keep trying to do better. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Cenk Uygur. You wrote a book.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A manifesto that outlines the progressive vision for America. So the big question, what are some defining ideas of progressivism?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>get arrested about four times the rate. That is an injustice that an enormous percentage of the country was comfortable with. Well, progressives aren't comfortable with it. We want justice for all. So equality of opportunity is an interesting one because the far left will say, at least some portions of them will say, equality of results. So progressives just want a fair chance, so free college education, but afterwards you don't get to have exact same results as either the wealthiest person or we're not all going to be equal. We don't have equal talent, skills, abilities, et cetera.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a lot of questions I can ask there. So on the circle of liberty, yes, so expanding the number of people whose freedoms are protected. But what about the magnitude of freedom for each individual person? So expanding the freedom of the individual and protecting the freedoms of an individual. It seems like progressives are more willing to expand the size of government where government can do all kinds of regulation, all kinds of controls in the individual.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>let's look at your positions. You're against paid family leave, that polls at 84%. So you're a radical corporatist who say that women should be forced back into work the day after they have birth. You're against a higher minimum wage, you're for every corporate position, and they all poll at 33% or less. So Joe Manchin is not at all a moderate, and this applies to almost every corporate Republican and every corporate Democrat. They're all extremists in supporting what I call corporatism. So you have to get to a balance in order to get to the right answer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's an interesting distinction here. So you're actually, as far as I understand, pro-capitalism, which is an interesting place to be. That's the thing that probably makes you center-left and then still populist. You're full of beautiful contradictions, let's say this, which will be great to untangle. But what's the difference between corporatism and capitalism? Is there a difference?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in our DNA. You could try to wish it into existence than they have, and it never works. And it's because once you have almost no rules in terms of, \"Oh, we're all equal,\" even though communism eventually winds up having an enormous amount of rules, it creates a power vacuum. When you say, \"Hey, there's no structure of power here. We're all equal. It's a flat line,\" one guy usually gets up because that's human nature, and goes, \"I don't think so. I think if you're going to leave a power vacuum, I'm going to take that power vacuum.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's actually a really interesting way to put it, because when everyone is equal, nobody is in power, and human nature is such that there's everybody [inaudible 00:10:33] that there's a will to power. So when you create a power vacuum, somebody's going to fill it. So the alternative is to have people in power, but there's a balance of power, and then there's a democratic system that elects the people in power and keeps churning and rotating who's involved.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>so we've been around for 22 years, longest running daily show on the internet ever. And so we were pre Iraq war and the Iraq war starts, and Dick Cheney starts handing out no-bid contracts. I'm like, what part of capitalism is a no-bid contract? You can't negotiate drug prices. That's the most anti-free market thing I have ever heard. It's almost like communism for corporations. They get everything and you get nothing. So it's preposterous, it's awful, and it kills the free markets, and it's killing this country, and it is the main ideology and religion of the establishment.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are all companies built the same here? So when you say corporatism, it seems like just looking here at the list by industry lobbyists, it seems like there are certain industries that are worse offenders than others, like pharmaceuticals, like insurance, oil and gas. So it seems to me it feels wrong to just throw all companies into the same bucket of they're all guilty.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the hell a corporation charges. That's insanity. Let alone the patents, let alone the fact that the American people pay for the research and then they make billions of dollars off of it and we get nothing but robbed by them. So it's about lobby power. Oil companies have huge lobby power. Defense contractors have huge lobby power. It's not that they're more evil, it's just that they have figured out the game better and they have basically taken the influence they need to capture the market, capture the government, and snuff out all competition, or a lot of competition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, figured out the game better. So I think a lot of companies are good at winning the right way by building better products, by making people happier with the work they're doing and the winning at the game of capitalism. And then there's other companies that win at the game of lobbying, and I just want to draw that distinction because I think it's a small subset of companies that are playing the game of lobbying. It's like big pharma.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of the corporate Democrats, and then all of a sudden we're no longer talking about Facebook at all and Facebook are angels. And now we've turned our attention to who? Facebook's top competitor, TikTok. Funny how that works. And by the way, then Donald Trump goes \"Oh TikTok's a big dangerous company working with China.\" And then Jeff Yaz comes in on this cycle, part owner of TikTok, and he doesn't want TikTok banished, of course. So he gives Trump a couple of million dollars. Trump turns around the next day and goes, \"We love TikTok. TikTok's a good company.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's a big contributor to influencing what politicians say and what they think. But it's not the entire thing, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No, it is. It's 98%. I'll go on mainstream media and they'll be like, \"Oh, I see what you're saying. I can see how that influences politicians about 10%.\" I'm like, \"No, no, it's 98%.\" And even a lot of good people think it's 50/50. They have principles and they have money. No, they have money and this smidge of principles. That's why I wanted to clarify 98 too.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so how do we fix it? So it's really interesting and nice that you have pro-capitalism and anti-corporatism. So how do we create a system where the free market can rule. Where capitalism can rule, we can have these vibrant flourishing of all these companies competing against each other and creating awesome stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to keep coming back to, balance. So when my dad was a small business owner in New Jersey and they inspected the elevator six times a year, that was over regulation. And I said to my dad, \"So should they not inspect it at all?\" I'm a young kid growing up and he said, \"Oh no, you got to inspect it at least twice a year.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Because in Turkey, sometimes they don't inspect it and then the elevator falls.\" So balance of reason, correct regulation to protect the markets and to protect the American people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but finding the right level of regulation, especially in, for example, in tech, something I'm much more familiar with, is very difficult because people in Congress are living in the 20th century before the internet was invented. So how are they supposed to come up with regulations?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the idea of the free market, is you should be able to compete. The market regulates, and then the government can step in and protect the market from forming monopolies, for example, which is easier to do.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But that's a form of regulation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But then there's more checking the elevator twice a year. That's a more sort of specific watching, micromanaging.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>politics, and I could explain how to do that in a sec, then you're at a place where you've got your best shot at honest representatives that are going to try their best to get to the right answer. Are they going to get to the right answer out of the gate? Usually not. So they pass a law, there's something wrong with the law, they then fix that part. It is a pendulum. You don't want it to swing too wildly, but you do need a little bit of oscillation in that pendulum to get to the right balance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, I was listening to Joe Biden from when he was like 30 years old, the speeches, he was eloquent as hell. It's fun to listen to actually. And he has a speech he gives or just maybe a conversation in Congress, I'm not sure where, where he talks about how corrupt the whole system is, and he's really honest and fun. And that Joe Biden was great, by the way, that guy. I mean, age sucks. People get older. But he was talking quite honestly about having to suck up to all these rich people and that he couldn't really suck up to the really rich people. They said, \"Come back to us 10 years later when you're more integrated into the system.\" But he was really honest about it, and he's saying, \"That's how it is. That's what we have to do. And that really sucks that that's what we have to do.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we did a video on our TikTok channel, then and now, of Joe Biden. This is when I was trying to push Biden out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We should say you were one of the people early on, saying Biden needs to step down.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I started about a year ago because I was positive that Biden had a 0% chance of winning. And it turned out, by the way, two days before he dropped out, his inside advisors inside the White House said, \"Yeah, near 0% chance of winning.\" So we were right all along.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You got a lot of criticism for that, by the way. But yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he's saying money in politics is the solution. In 2020, he said, \"Well, I can raise more money than Bernie. I can kiss corporate ass better than Bernie. I'm the biggest corporate kisser in the world. So, I'm going to raise a billion dollars and you need to support me.\" Now, of course, he doesn't say it in those words, but that was the message to the establishment. Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Obama, Clyburn, everybody goes, \"Oh, that's right. Biden, Biden, Biden, Biden, not Bernie.\" I don't know that there's anybody in the country who instinctually dislikes Bernie more than Barack Obama.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's an interesting... I'm not taking that tangent at this moment. You mentioned mainstream media. What's the motivation for mainstream media to be corporatist also?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>used to work at MSNBC, Fox News, et cetera. David once did a piece about money and politics at a local NBC news station, and his editor or GM spiked the story. David goes into his office and asks him, \"So why? This story is true. It's a huge part of politics. If we're going to report on this issue, we got to tell you what's actually happening.\" So he says, \"David, come here.\" He puts his arm around his shoulders, takes him to the big newsroom, and he goes, \"You see all this? Money in politics paid for that.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's really fascinating. So, big corporations, they're giving money to politicians through different channels, and then the politicians are spending that money on mainstream media. So, there's a vicious cycle where it's in the interest of the mainstream media not to criticize the very corporations that are feeding that cycle. It's not actually direct, it's not like corporations are... Because I was thinking one of the ways is direct advertisement. Pharmaceuticals obviously advertise a lot on mainstream media, but there's also indirect, which is giving the politicians money or super PACs and the super PACs and the spend money on...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the ads themselves actually, they work and they work pretty well, but that's not the main reason you spend money on ads. You spend the money on ads to get friendly coverage from the content, from the free media that you're getting from that same outlet. So, since every newspaper and every television station and network knows that the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are their top clients, they're going to get billions of dollars from them. They never really criticized the Republican and Democratic Party. On the other hand, if you're an outsider, they'll rip your face off.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's also really interesting. So, if you're an advertiser, if you're big pharma and you're advertising, it's not that the advertisement works. It's that the hosts are too afraid, not explicitly, just even implicitly. They're self-censoring. They're not going to have any guests that are controversial, anti-big pharma, or they're not going to make any jokes about big pharma. That continues and expands. That's really interesting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you moving it to? They literally moved it into a closet and they made sure that everybody in the building saw her getting taken off the air and moved into a closet. The closet is the memo, right? That's the memo to the whole building, you better shut up and do as you're told, okay? So that way, I don't have to tell you and get myself in trouble. It's super obvious. There are guardrails here, and you are not allowed to go beyond acceptable thought. Acceptable thought is our sponsors are great, politicians are great, the powerful are great.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So how do we begin to fix that, and what exactly are we fixing? Is it the influence of the lobbyists? It feels like companies have found different ways to achieve influence. So, how do we get money out of politics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So it's very difficult but doable and we will do it, but in order to do it, the populist left and the populist right have to unite. By the way, that is why we have the culture wars.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's why you're voting for Trump.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>No chance. So, we can get into that in a minute. So, the culture wars are meant to divide us. If we get united, we have enough leverage and power to be able to do it, but you can't do it through a normal bill. Because if you do it on a bill, the whole point of capturing the Supreme Court was to make sure that they kill any piece of legislation that would protect the American people.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're saying the Supreme Court is also captured by this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>blue states, getting three-quarters of the states to agree is near impossible. But there is one issue that the whole country agrees on, 93% of Americans believe that politicians serve their donors and not their voters. So, this is the one thing we can unite on. If we unite on this, we push our states to call for a convention. We all go to the convention together, we bring democracy alive, and we propose amendments to the Constitution. The best amendment gets three-quarters of the states to ratify. You go above the Supreme Court and you solve the whole thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So if 93% of people want this, why hasn't it happened yet? I mean, the obvious answer is there's corporate control of the media and the politicians, but it seems like our current system and the megaphone that a president has should be able to unite the populace left and right. So, it shouldn't be that difficult to do. Why hasn't a person like Trump who's a billionaire or on the left, a rich businessman run just on this and win?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>come back to that, but why hasn't Trump done it? It's easy. He's like, \"What am I, a sucker? The guy gives me money. I do what the guy wants. Why would I get rid of that? That's how I got into power. So, that's how I'm doing it now.\" I go to [inaudible 00:47:29] and say, \"Give me $100 million and I'll let Israel annex the West Bank. So, I'll go to the oil companies and give me $1 billion and I'll give you tax subsidies. I'll let you drill. I'll take away regulation. Why would I stop that?\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think he likes money more than he likes being popular? Because there's a big part of him that's a populist in the sense that he loves being admired by large masses of people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>those of us on the populist left, yeah, we're not enamored by politicians. For example, when Bernie does the wrong thing, we call him out. Bernie is not my Goddamn uncle. I don't like him for some personality reason. It's not a cult of personality. You do the right thing, I love you for it. You do the wrong thing, I'm going to kick your ass for it. But Donald Trump does this massive ridiculous corruption over and over again. MAGA is like, \"I'm here for it. Love it. As long as you're doing the corruption, I'm okay with it.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does Trump say about getting money out of politics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The whole panel laughed out loud. They're like, \"Get a load of this crazy guy.\" I said, \"He's a populist who seems to hate the establishment in a populist time. Drain the swamp is a great slogan. I knew he would win when he was in a Republican debate and he said, 'I paid all these guys. Before I paid them, and they did whatever I wanted.'\" I was like, \"That's so true.\" People will love that, and especially Republican voters will love that. I actually have a lot of respect for Republican voters because they actually genuinely hate corruption.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So what would an amendment look like that helps prevent money being an influence in politics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So I started a group called Wolf-PAC.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nice name.<|eot_id|>"}

That's when conservatives, because they've been propagandized by corporate media. Yes, mainstream media got into your head too. Right-wing media got into your head too, and right-wing media also financed by a lot of this corrupt interest. So, they tell you, \"Oh, you don't want to publicly finance. Oh, my God. You'd be spending like $1 billion on politicians.\" Brother, they're spending trillions of dollars of your money because they're financed by the guys that they're giving all of your money to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you educate me?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Indirect funding's gone, direct funding's gone. You have to set up some thresholds. Not everybody can just get money to run. You have to prove that you have some popular support. So, signature gathering, you would still allow for small money donations like up to $100, something along those lines.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Not 5,000 or whatever it is now.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>again, watch out for corporations, because once they form, they will amass money and power and look to kill off democracy. They were totally right. That's exactly what happened. So, it's not that you don't have them. It's that through democratic capitalism, you limit their power. You can give them a bunch of rights. You say, \"Hey, you have a right to exist. You have a right to do this, this, and this, but you do not have constitutional rights of a citizen.\" So you don't have the right to speak to a politician by giving them a billion dollars.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You believe that the people will be able to find the right policies to regulate and tax the corporations such that capitalism can flourish still?<|eot_id|>"}

They think corporate tax cuts makes a lot of sense. You not getting higher wages, you not having healthcare, it makes a lot of sense. It doesn't make any goddamn sense, but they get themselves to believe it. That's another portion of the invisible hand of the market.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's problems with every path. So, the elite, like you mentioned, can be corrupted by greed, by power, and so on. But the crowd, I agree with you, by the way, about the wisdom of the crowd versus the wisdom of the elite, but the crowd can be captured by a charismatic leader. I'm probably a populist myself. The problem with populism is that it can't be and has been throughout history captured by bad people.<|eot_id|>"}

I don't want to say contradiction, but there's a tension that creates the balance. So, to me, in the way you're speaking might result in hurting capitalism. So, it is easy in fighting corporatism to hurt companies, to go too far the other way.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, of course.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So when you talk about corporate tax, so what's the magic number for the corporate tax? If it's too high, companies leave.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>headed towards corruption because it's the 80s now. We're past 78, magic 78 marker. Even Carter was way more conservative economically than people realize because we're already getting past it by the time it's in his administration. But the bottom line is, yes, whenever you have real wisdom of the crowd, whether it's in business or in politics, you're going to have fluctuation. You're going to have that pendulum swinging back and forth. You don't want wild swings, communism, corporatism, right? You want to get to hey, where's the right balance here between capitalism and what people think is socialism?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So, I guess I agree with most of the things you said about the corruption. I just wish there would be more celebration of the fact that capitalism and some incredible companies in the history of the 20th century has created so much wealth, so much innovation that has increased the quality of life on average. They've also increased the wealth inequality and exploitation of the workers and this stuff, but you want to not forget to celebrate the awesomeness that companies have also brought outside the political sphere just in creating awesome stuff.<|eot_id|>"}

This thing is over. And I go tell people, and they're like, \"You are crazy.\" Why do they think I'm crazy? Because MSNBC is lying to them 24/7, telling them that Joe Biden created sliced bread, and the wheel, and fire.

But was he forced out at knife point or something? No. So was it voluntary? Yeah. Ultimately, if Biden decided to stay in, there was nothing we could do about it. And so he had to voluntarily make that decision. But he voluntarily made it, because he had no choice left.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. I wish he stepped down voluntarily from a place of strength. So I think presidents, I think politicians in general, especially at the highest levels, want legacy. And to me at least, one of the greatest things you could do is to walk away at the top. I mean, George Washington, to walk away from power is I think universally respected, especially if you got a good speech to go with it and you do it really well, not in some kind of cynical or calculated or some kind of transactional way, but just as a great leader. And maybe be a little bit even more dramatic than you need to be in doing it. Yeah, I thought that would be a beautiful moment.

Any political professional knows you're not going to win. So you have hero or villain, and you get to choose. But if you think you're going to be a hero and beat Trump, that is not a choice you have.

It just cares about drama. And then the same as conspiracy theories. Now, some conspiracy theories have value and depth, and they allow us to question the institutions, but the bottom line is conspiracy theories get clicks.

Thanks to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in the apparatus of coercion, totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within.\" Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.<|eot_id|>"}
