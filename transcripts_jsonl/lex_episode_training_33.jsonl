The following is a conversation with Neil Adams, a legend in the sport of judo. He is a world champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist, five-time European champion, and often referred to as the voice of judo commentating all the major events, world championships and Olympic Games. Highlighting the drama, the triumph, the artistry of the sport of judo. Making fans like me feel the biggest wins, the biggest losses, the surprise turns of fortune, the dominance of champions coming to an end and new champions made. Always speaking from the heart. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neil Adams. You are a five-time European champion, world champion two-time Olympic silver medalist. Let's first go to the 1980 Olympics. Where was your mind? What was your preparation like? What was your strategy leading into that Olympics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>78 kilograms. And I got third place at the '79 world championships, the weight below. Fought the whole year at the higher weight category, didn't lose a contest. So I'd beaten everybody in the world. And then I had to make the decision as to whether to drop to the weight below because I was seeding in the weight below. It was a different seeding then. And so I decided to drop into the weight below because I was seeded in the top four. And as it happens, I think it was probably the worst decision I made. Well because...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Simply because, I mean, it was the only contest that I lost was the final of the Olympic Games in that year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're a young kid, what? Like 19-20 at that time full of confidence, vigor. So the decision to cut weight, how hard was it for you to cut weight to the 71 kg division?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>higher weight category and won that. And so everybody that was on the Olympic rostrum at the Olympic Games was my rostrum at the European championships. So was it a mistake? Yeah, because I didn't have my diet sorted out. My nutrition was appalling and when I, it wasn't as kind of readily available as it is now for the nutrition. And I would say that if anything lost me that final, other than the fact that I was fighting somebody was terrific. He was an excellent, brilliant athlete, but definitely didn't help that my nutrition was not very good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so you lost to Ezio Gamba. There's probably a lot of that we could say about that particular match. Maybe let's zoom in. What were your strengths and weaknesses, judo-wise in that Olympics? You said you haven't really lost the match, you won the European Championship leading into it, but if you had weak spots, okay, you already said diet, but specifically on the mat in terms of judo.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that none of the fights lasted time going into the final. So I won fairly quickly and every match by ippon way before time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember how you won the matches?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I won them by throw, a couple of throws for ippon and then an armlock for ippon. Semi-final was an armlock against the East German Kruger. And yeah, I was flying through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What were the throws? Do you remember?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Tai otoshi, uchi mata. My favorite kind of te-waza, my favorite throws. And then Juji-Gatame as well, which was a Juji-Gatame roll. Against an East German who I'd beaten before but always had a really tough match, but managed to beat him well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you had a beautiful exhibition of Japanese-type Judo in the first two matches. You threw people and then you also did the [inaudible 00:06:43], unbarred a person. Great. So going into the final, what are the weaknesses going into the final against the Italian?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Like I say, taking nothing away from him as a great athlete and a brilliant Judo man and left, which wasn't good for me. That was definite no, I hated fighting leftys, still do, but I'll tell you why in a minute. I just did...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's one of those. But I think as I went through the contest, we had an eight-hour break from the semi-final to the final. They took us back to the Olympic village, then we had to come back in and then we had to start a warmup again. So I kind of lost my momentum, I had to start again, and I just had a job to get going. I got halfway through, started to rescue a dying match, and I was kind of one step, half a step behind all the way through. So never really got into it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So why do you hate fighting leftys? And leftys are, we should say, overrepresented in terms of the higher ranks of Judo. I don't know why that is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fight rightys, right-handers. I mean 70% of the population are right-handers, 30% left. So they get to fight more right-handers and it's just a fact that happens. So the thing that they hate is fighting left against left. They don't like it left against left. Whereas a right-hander will go right against right, but the opposite is awkward would for me because just simply, I like to go onto the sleeve and then I like to dominate the grips, but the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted, so I had to work hard, really hard against it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What happened in that match?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a split decision in the end. And so to lose an Olympic final on a split decision is pretty, it's something that's still on my mind. And I think that it's a strange one because I can still wake up, that one and four years later at the Olympics, I was silver medalist at the Olympics four years later as well. And yeah, it still haunts me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you sometimes wake up and think like, \"Eh, I should have eaten better\" or maybe a specific grip that you're like, \"Ah, I shouldn't have taken that grip.\"?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I do. I mean the diet side of it, its difficult to really admit that, isn't it that you went to an Olympic Games and the one thing that you really sucked at, right, was one of the most important things now at world level sport. Where you've got the nutrition, we've got it, you would think that most people have got it sorted, but there's still people making mistakes and still people that haven't got it totally sorted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's people like Travis Stevens who I think doesn't care. He'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work. I think the way he spoke about it is you can't always control nutrition, so it's best to get good at having crappy nutrition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a good way of looking at it. I never, yeah, maybe that's what I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly, exactly. Do you remember what you were eating? Are we talking about candy or?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>time either. So the diet wasn't steak and good nutritional salads and things like that. I did what I thought was best without proper advice. And the crazy thing is that I had such good advice as well when it came to fitness training and things like that. We're quite ahead of our time and we really had it nailed as far as the conditioning was concerned, the judo training as well was way in advance. I was a good trainer and I trained more than most. I can honestly say that. It probably got me away with a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where was your mind? So mental preparation going into that Olympics, you said you were confident, but is there some preparation aspect behind that confidence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>way, I didn't lose that many contests. So the only ones I lost were in the final of the world championships or in the final of the Olympic Games. I didn't lose that many. I never lost a European title. I had seven golds at European championships, five at seniors, two at juniors under twenties. I never lost a final. And then I only lost two on a split decision. So I didn't lose that many. And my attitude was that I wasn't going to lose and couldn't lose. So I was always surprised when I did, when something happened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In Neil Adams, A Life in Judo, written in 1986. You wrote, \"Ever since I can remember I have wanted to win. It wasn't the ordinary feeling that children have when they take part in their first primary school sack race on a grass track or even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the county side. With me, the desire to win was and still is as much a part of me as my arms and legs. In other words, it wasn't something I learned as I grew older, but rather it was deeply rooted in me. Perhaps this competitive instinct is the greatest difference between my public image and the view from the inside.\" So people see the kindness, the warmth you have the charisma of the excitement, but there's this big drive to win inside you. So what's behind that? Can you just speak to that, that drive to win and how that contributed to your career?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you know when I look back now...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is a lot of years ago, we should say.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is a lot of years ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that true or were you just being poetic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's not far off. No. When I think about it now, I'd like to think that I'm a different person now. And since I've kind of calmed down, I see athletes now and I see them and their kind of arrogance, their walk, and it's a strut and it's a kind of a confidence, isn't it? As we're older and as I've become older, I've calmed down, but it doesn't matter what I'm doing, it's still that will to win. And I'm much better at masking it now if I don't. But it still bothers me as much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're talking about like... I don't know, even just stupid, silly things. Like I don't know, a game of pool or something like this or just anything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>train with the best and I could still go with anybody. And then when 40 hit, kind of things started to fall off a little bit and I used to get either my hips or the legs and my knees. And I realized that I had to pick my practices and that rankled as well and I had to then just calm it down a little bit, otherwise I was going to be injured and I was going to be... It's not a good thing when you getting older and you've still got the same competitive mind, but things change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's still there. You get on the mat probably even now, right? You get on the mat with a world champion, you still the current world champion, there's still a little part of you. Could I still toss this guy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you know...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Kids these days are soft.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, you know what, some of these athletes, I mean I give you a prime example, right? Is Ilias Iliadis. He is a monster, right? And of course you couldn't because just at sixty-something you couldn't, but you like to think that you could.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You could, you never know. You got to find out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know what you would do. What you can do is you can cause them problems and they feel it immediately. But you'd last a minute.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've trained with Ilias Iliadis, I've gotten a chance to train with him as well. He's a really nice guy, really great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Great guy. He trained with me. We were training together every hotel that we used to go into, we'd end up in the gym together and we'd train. And this one time he was in there and he just wanted somebody to grab and grip hold of. And so we ended up doing this kind of grappling in the middle, the people doing weight training and the different things watching these two mad men doing... I'm glad we weren't on a mat at that particular time. But good fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about that guy? He like you achieved a lot of success when he was young.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>able to compete with the men. There's not many men can do that. And it doesn't happen very often. It happens later with the men and often they're not physically as developed as they... So for me, for example, I fought Nevzorov who was world Olympic champion. He was the current world Olympic champion, and they sent me to the European Championship senior at 17 and that doesn't happen very often. And I fought, I pulled Nevzorov, I fought Nevzorov and I had him really worried because he expected without a doubt, to come out, throw this kid and junior.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he was thick and shredded. [inaudible 00:17:36] he's a man.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He was shredded. There's a picture of him in his judogi and his judogi is just cut and he looks the business. And there's me in this baggy...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Skinny kid.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Skinny kid inside this baggy thing. And the thing was is that the more he tried and the harder he tried, and the more he panicked, the further it went away from him. And so of course he got the decision at the end and deservedly, but I worried him. And so for me that was a massive step forward because year later I was starting to fill out and two years later I was competing for the Olympic title.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know if I remember, but Ilias Iliadis is interesting because even at 17 I feel like he was doing big throws, like literally lifting them with the hips.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Just rips them out the ground. And I was saying to Nikki, my wife, and she said, \"What would you do now? It was different than the way you did then.\" I never had any pickups. That's not what we did. But you have a look at the young Ukrainians or the young Russians or the young Eastern Bloc Mongolians and they're ripping people out the ground. I mean it's just different style of judo and it just looks different. But now they're starting to do traditional style judo as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you speak to that? What are the different styles of judo? So for you, you mentioned uchi mata, tai otoshi, these... How would you describe them? They're like these effortless, less lifting off the ground and power and strength and more timing and position, movement, momentum, all this kind of stuff. That's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo because for Japanese judo, the traditional judo, you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the balance and the direction and the skill to do that and knowing how to do it and how to use movement. And then you get the wrestlers and the leg picks and the single leg, double legs. And by 1995 judo was bent over. And so it was the IOC that went to IJF, International Judo Federation. And they said, \"You've got to change this, or we're just going to have one wrestling style. It looks like wrestling with judo, with judo jackets on. \"So you either change it or we are going to take one of you out.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, we should sort of clarify when we say people are bent over, that's usually how you see freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers are more bent over to defend the legs and so on. And traditional judo people are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do the big throws and all that kind of stuff. But I think the other case to make for banding leg grabs is a lot of people are using it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and all that kind of stuff. So it's not just to make it different from wrestling, it is also like you want to maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it standing up. And also it increases the possibility of defense with the hips. Because actually good defense, judo wise, standing up is with the hips as opposed to sticking your arms out and then sticking your backsides out there just to defend. All right, so if you attack me and I move my body in the wrong place, so I'm in the wrong place at the right time, so you don't hit the right target. And then also I use my hips. So again, it's a form of judo that was being lost. So now we've got it back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's go there. Let's speak about judo as if we're talking to a group of five-year-olds. So what is judo? What are some defining characteristics of judo as a sport, as a way, as a martial arts, a way of life, all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So when they come see us, so seeing my wife and I, it's like dojo. It's not grandma granddad, it's dojo. So dojo. They take their shoes off going into the dojo. So they have respect for where they're at. I think it has that kind of feeling that I tried to build my dojo with a feeling of reverence. It's kind of almost peaceful. I'm not a religious person, but I like going to old churches because when I go into an old church, it doesn't matter what the religion within the church, but there's a reverence in there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Reverence is a good word. It feels like a really special place no matter which dojo you go to, it's just you bow and there's a calmness before the storm of battle or whatever it is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and respect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, respect.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>this Olympic gold medal. French. What a great champion she is because she lost one of the matches. I mean, she'd come back and she'd given birth, come back after giving birth and everybody was going, \"Well, will she...?\" And then she lost one of the matches on the way through and she said, \"Well, don't be upset. It's just one match. It's just one contest. Next time I'm going to put it right.\" And she did put it right and now she's back up there and she won the world title back. So these are great champions for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean that's the right way to see it. But it's also tragic to lose the Olympic Games.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Twice. Yes, it is tragic. And I do have sleepless nights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean that's the magic of the Olympic Games. Anything can happen. And your 1980 Olympics were very different from 1984, but if we just linger on '80 and just what we're talking about, how much you wanted to win, do you love winning or hate losing more?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I hate losing more, but I love winning. When I won the world title the year later, and I had no doubt when I went into that day that I was going to be world champion. No doubt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you won the '81 World Championship.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>At the higher weight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At the 78.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Kg. Actually, can we go there? What was going through your mind? You ended up arm barring a Japanese fighter. I talked to Jimmy Pedro, a friend of yours, somebody who said you were a mentor to him for many years, and he told me a bunch of different questions to ask you, but he said that was a really special time. That was a really special dominant run you had, and especially finishing with an arm bar against a Japanese player. So take me through that. What do you remember from that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there just going forward trying to win. And that's a difference to somebody who's trying not to lose. And there's two different ways there. So sometimes when you... When I was world champion then I had a period of time where every time I stepped out there I was really afraid of losing. And I think that that's what happens later on in your competitive career. The great champions managed to come through that. Teddy Renair is one of those, he puts it out there and he keeps beating them so they can't take it away from them. It's fantastic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So stepping on the mat, every single encounter you're trying to win, you're looking for the grips with the intention to throw big, even when you're ahead on points and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>clock, it depends when you go ahead. So sometimes you can go ahead in the first minute, and you've still got three minutes to go. So I see the ones then that go into, \"I don't want to lose\", because they go into defensive mode. And then sometimes they can lose it on penalties or something can go wrong, and the other one comes on strong and then they can sneak the contest. And so it's really difficult. But when I was coaching, I was trying to always encourage that positive attitude for the full four minutes, five minutes then.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've competed a lot in judo and jiu-jitsu. I've always hated that part of myself. When I'm up on points by a lot, you look at the clock and it's what you do when you look at the clock, it's a minute and a half, you're really tired and you quit. You just defend. And I hated that part about myself. It's like that-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's saying don't do it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well as opposed to, in judo for a big throw, just keep going For the throw. In jiu-jitsu, it's go for the submission, win in the real way, versus on points. I hated that part of myself. Mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by exhaustion.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>all the time. And actually they're then more difficult to catch. We had one just a couple of weeks ago, and he lost in the final second of the contest. He was the only one to score. He got penalized all the way up. Two seconds to go and stepped out of the area. But he went like that, thinking the bell was just going. And the bell went one second after he actually stepped out. So he got penalized, lost the match and lost all of the points for qualification. So that's paying high price. That's paying high price.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a thin line between triumph and tragedy in those competitions. But especially at the Olympic games. So let's just stick on '81 World Championship. What did it feel like to win that world championship. And also getting an arm bar as a Japanese player? Jamie told me your arms were exhausted.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>up, because remember ours is about gripping as well on the jacket. So if you can't grip up, then you can't gain the advantage, then they can throw you. So you have to decide. So I had a massive attack on him and we changed directions four or five times, and then I wasn't going to let him go. But still when I was turning him there, I had to decide am I going to go all out for this? There has been occasions when I've released it, just if I've got a minute to go and just block out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Correct.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I knew it. As soon as I climbed his back and then I thought he's not going. I'm not going to let him up. So I was just changing-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Little voice in your head.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It started in turtle, because I did an attack, came back out of the attack and then he went on to his front.

Our groundwork is the transition from standing down to ground. We don't have a situation where you can work your way in. You are in or you not in. You're standing. So you've got to make sure that you're in. And so I was just on his back like a leech and I never let him go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's where the arm bars, that's where the attacks on the ground, which is called newaza, happens is in the transition.

It's everything I said as a kid that I had no idea how difficult it was going to be. So as a kid, as a fourteen-year-old kid, I remember saying, \"I'm going to be world champion. I'm going to be the best in the world.\" I had no idea how difficult that was going to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well there's wisdom to that.

And went out there and there were these different fighters out there that were treating me with total disdain. And I remember thinking, \"How dare they?\" And I realized when I came back from that event, there's other people out there. And there are different levels. Majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different levels that there are out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember a certain opponent that for the first time you felt like, \"Holy shit.\" Somebody just gripped you up and you're like, \"There's another level to this game.\"<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I could go probably months without getting thrown in training here in Europe. And go to Japan and everybody's thrown you. And that's difficult to accept. And the reason that kind of danger and that kind of feeling of danger is something that puts a real edge on. And so that was the first time. When I got hold of Nishida, \"I thought, oh my god. This guy.\" It didn't matter which way he was turning, like that you'd be stretched out. And I thought, \"I want to do this.\" And then I ended up fighting him again in Japan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that feeling of danger is really interesting. I've did randori with a lot of world-class people from different parts of the world including Ilias Iliadis.

Because then you'll understand why they do certain things with the grips. Because these guys, when somebody grips you and you know you're going to go. When Iliadis puts his arm over your back, all right. And you know you're going to go up and over. You know you're going to go over.

This guy was a nightmare. And like a monster. He was single legging me. And it was just totally different. So the jacket makes a massive difference. Huge difference to something. And people think it's just the jacket that we're wearing, but it isn't. It's our only tool actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and it's a way of establishing control over another body. And it's a whole art form and a science. And I don't even know if you understand it really. You understand it subconsciously through time, because there's so much involved.

This guy is six foot nine and he is built like Garth. And not only that, he's skillful as well. And he's got that mentality of a winner. He has got that mentality of a winner there. He just wins important matches.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he goes over the top of the grip. Where's that land now in terms of rules over the top?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, well as long as they throw from it. So they can take any grip as long as you move them and then catch them, action-reaction really. As long as you catch them on the move, then you can do it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So as long as you're not using it to stall or that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, you can't block out.

So you've got to stop that. You can't have that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, definitely. You were the favorite to win the 1984 Olympics, but you got silver.

I can't really explain why it was just a little bit off. I see it so often now with a lot of the guys that are going for second, third Olympic games.

And so if you've got somebody that is not really understanding of what's happening in the inner part of the game, so it might be a technical thing or it might be the tactical part of the play here that's going on. And if you can introduce that, as well, then you've got an advantage.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Quick pause. I need a bathroom break.=<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Okay. Good stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So we just took a little break and went to Judotv.com, which is, I guess, an IGF website. IGF is the organization behind a lot of the big judo events in the world. And I just signed up, you should sign up, too. It's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely, sign up. Cheaper the price, cheaper the price.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And you can watch basically any match from the Grand Slams and going back through history, I guess.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I've got to say Lex, I mean everybody. Still people saying to me, \"We need more judo on television.\" They've got judo on television every other week that they can access. All of the top people in all the top events and it costs $100 a year to access everything. And they can play all the videos. I mean we've just accessed this here, the Paris tournament, and we're going to have a look at Teddy Riner. It's cheap at the price.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>We're now in Paris Grand Slam 2024. Teddy Riner final. By the way, super cool. You click on the draw. You can just look at any of the matches. You can go at the bottom of the finals, you can go...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>To anyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Any one of them. That's so cool. That's really well done. Really well done interface. Anyway, let me first ask the ridiculous big question. Who do you think is the greatest of all time? Is Teddy Riner in the running?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's the greatest judo winner of all time. Of that, there's no doubt. I think if you asked him whether he was the greatest judo man in the world of all time, he would say, \"No, I'm not.\" And he's not the greatest judo man. There are people with more beautiful judo in some ways, although he's got great technique. But he is the ultimate winner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>10-time world champ, two-time gold medalist in the Olympics. I guess two-time bronze medalist. He's going to Paris?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's going after it again. So he's right here.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's right there. This is just a couple of months ago. And then last week, last week he was out again and he won again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You think he gets gold medal this time?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>would say the same. There's nobody that's, and Yamashita was unbeaten in international competition. I trained with Yamashita a lot over a two-year period and got to know him quite well. And he was one of the greatest of all times. For me, he was one of the greatest Judo men. I'm talking about from a technical point of view, from a spectacular judo point of view, understanding the fundamental principles of how techniques work. Sometimes having different techniques that work for you. So if one doesn't work and one particular direction doesn't work, you can change the direction completely.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In case people don't know, Yamashita has this legendary judoka heavyweight. Teddy Riner heavyweight, that's plus 100 kg.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He would've caused him all sorts of problems.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh yeah, that's cool. Who do you think wins? Yamashita?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes, I think Yamashita.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think Yamashita beats Teddy Riner?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think so.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Strong words. You think so. You think so. Yamashita is on the shorter side, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and he finds it more difficult with shorter people. It would've been a very interesting confrontation. And I think if you asked Yamashita, he would probably say that Teddy Riner, he's very gracious. He's really gracious. It would be really good. It would've been an unbelievable matchup. And I've got to say this, that Teddy Riner is the greatest winner of all time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Competition wise. It's interesting. Both of them, maybe you can correct me, but have this Osoto Gari, which is kind of trip that I never understood.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It is a very tricky thing to do, right? It's very easy to do maybe as a white belt. You roll in. You can understand. But to do it at the high, high, high level?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>any of the top guys now, especially if they're second time out. So they might catch somebody by surprise. They come out and they go, bang. And you go, \"That was amazing.\" But if they fought again 10 minutes later, you go, \"You're not going to catch me with that.\" You've got a different situation here. And so it's slightly different. But the best fighters adapt like that. And they're able to see a situation, feel the situation, and they attack once and then go again and attack second, third time. And in the third time they make it work><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Both Yamashita and Teddy Riner with the Osoto Gari, they'll just hit it over and over in the match.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then you make a readjustment of the way in. It's a little bit like, I mean, if you take a really easy way of understanding it is that if we're shooting at a target and all of a sudden you start moving that target, it's different hitting a moving target. But it's also different hitting a moving target that's trying to hit you as well. And that's our game. So we are not only trying to throw a moving target, we're trying to throw a moving target that's trying to throw us. So it makes it even more difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a few folks who, you know what's coming. It's over and over and over it's the same attack. Anyway, with this uchi mata it's different. It's different. There's not many people like that where it's the same attack. I mean there's other attacks also, but they'll just go after the same thing over and over and over.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>get a lot of teachers do that all. And they'll say, immediately, \"What do you write with? Left or right hand?\" And it's no indicator actually as to how we do judo because I'm left-handed and I do more predominantly right-handed because I lead off my strongest hand. And actually most people do. So actually left and right is a bit of a trap sometimes when we're teaching. Better to get, because we can go... My point was, is that a lot of people can go both flanks, so they'll do something over this side and something over this side.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But anyway, he was one-sided?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He was one-sided, but he could switch it. So he had a seoi nage as well on the other side so he could switch it if he had to.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interesting. And by the way, your opponent in '84, was he righty or lefty?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He was a righty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that drop left seoi, where did that come from?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, I mean again, he could have probably in other contests, he'd hit me with it several times and I've just stopped it. Just at the wrong place at the right time for him. Right place in the wrong time for me. Right?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's life. Yeah.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>All right, let's watch some Teddy Riner.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is final of Paris tournament. And this is against the Korean. The Korean had had a great day, actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Again, shorter.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Again, shorter. So he does find that difficult. Have a look at Teddy Riner. Teddy Riner will try and catch the sleeve. He's after the sleeve and then the right arm over the top. That's the key point for Teddy Riner. And of course, what he has done, if he can't always catch the big Osoto Gari over, his right-hand side, he's been doing something to the opposite side.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The Korean just went for a drop sail and Teddy Riner blocked with the hips.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A big boy has difficulty always against somebody smaller dropping with the seoi nages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Has Teddy Riner ever been thrown for ippon?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've never seen his thrown ippon, but he was thrown last week for a nice technique and he's being caught more and more.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's getting close.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And Tasoev, in the final of the world championships, they had a strange situation there where Tasoev was a technique down and then pulled off a counter. And they didn't count it, but then they overruled it. Unfortunately, I was commentating at the time and I went for a score for Tasoev. Anyway, they overruled it and then they awarded a second gold medal to Tasoev.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What can you say about Tamerlan Bashaev who also gave him trouble?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, Bashaev and Tasoev are the two that could possibly go to the Olympics. That was a close one there from Riner, that was closest that he'd actually been there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Didn't have the sleeve and he relies on the sleeve, greatly. Big support there in the French, in the crowd.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And also maybe can you explain the penalties for stalling?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, so if they don't attack, if they've got a grip and they've got sleeve, lapel, or they've got two hands on. If they're too passive and they don't attack. If they've got dominant sleeve grip, they don't attack. That was quite close as well from the Koreans. So the Korean here, you can see, is having a real go. The penalties will come if they don't attack at the right time. Step outside the yellow area, they'll get penalized as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's dedication for...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Absolutely. I mean it was really close, wasn't it? They nice little kouchi gari there from the Korean. And if they touch below the belt line with the arms, they're not allowed to grab the legs. They've stopped grabbing the legs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow. The Koreans really going.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The Koreans having a real good go at it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess every single person in that division is probably training for Teddy Riner, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You think that Teddy Riner has been there a long time and he's got another guy here in the final of the Paris tournament. He's got 18,000 people watching him. They're all on Teddy Riner's side. They want him to win. And the Korean's out there on his own with his coach.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But also the pressure on Teddy Riner.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Amazing pressure. We interviewed him after this and he said, \"I've got pressure. People go, well, is he going to do it at the Olympic Games? Can I do it in Paris?\" He wanted to go to Paris. I mean really, the last Olympic Games should have been it, shouldn't it? The last should have been the final one. But he's gone, \"No, I've got to do another four years.\" Two penalties are on the board already for the Korean. That Korean is really having a great go on Teddy Riner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>He's got a bit of a lift on him. He's going after it.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>He's really going after it. It's an amazing effort there from the Korean. And he's getting some last minute information. I don't know if you've ever seen his coach, stood next to him like that. But it's amazing. He's six foot six and he's about four foot six. He's a real pitch.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Full of passion. I love it. He's screaming.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Golden score.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How does golden score work? Can you say?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So the golden score, if it goes without any point on the board from a throw or a hold down or arm lock strangle, then it goes into golden score. So two shidos on the board a piece, one more mistake now and it's going to be all over. And that's it. Teddy Riner just manages to turn it on the Korean. And that went really against the run of play, didn't it? The Korean did better. But Teddy Riner is a winner. And he says, \"Right, okay, let's have more cheering.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Finds a way to score in the...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I have to say, that even when he loses, he's always graceful. He doesn't like it, but he's graceful.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there was so much love there. Celebration. It's great. It's great to see. It's great that he's doing it again, going after it. Chasing the gold medal again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Well, he's chasing the gold medal. It's going to be in Paris, which is going to be even more fantastic. He's already the greatest. You said, \"What has he got to do to be the greatest?\" He's already the greatest competitor Judo's ever known. And that was even with the great Tani. Tani was amazing, as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Are you part of the commentating team for Paris?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm part of the commentating team, but it won't be for IJF because it's independent broadcast.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Have you ever had an athlete come up to you and ask, \"Why'd you say that?\" Or disagree with your commentary?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I've got to say that 99.9% of everybody is so grateful that I've commentated their fights all the way through. They know if they've messed up. So if I say something and I'm never disparaging, really disparaging, but what I will say is, \"It was a great throw by the other guy. Or it was a great match.\" And if they made a mistake, so if they walk out, they know that I will say something that will mean something. Nobody really moans about it. I try and talk the truth, if I can.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So who else would you consider as some of the greats? So I personally, just because I love the seoi nage, Koga. So there's the number of times you won the world championships and the Olympic Games, but there's also how you won and how you wanted to fight and what you did. It's not necessarily about getting gold medals, it's about how you fought and how you represent the sport. There's certain athletes, like Inoue and Iliadis, that are going after the big throws.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and it's a bit like when Tyson stepped out there, you knew what you were going to get. And if they went toe-to-toe, if Tyson had somebody going toe-to-toe, somebody was going to get knocked out. We got the same in Judo, when people go head-to-head and it's an open match and I often talk about an open match, I say, \"It's an open match. They're both trying to score. Somebody is going to get scored on. Somebody's going to go.\" And that makes it exciting. When they come out and they close up, then that's not an exciting match.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is there a case for Ono? Shohei Ono, three-time world champ, two-time gold medalist?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think that judo-wise, he's got to be one of the greatest because he had such versatility. He could go right and he could go left. He could pick up. He could go to the ground as well. He won a lot of his earlier matches on the ground. I think his empathy and how he presents himself, sometimes he falls down. I think that hopefully that should come with tutoring and how to be a great champion after. It's not just about what you do on the mat, but what you do off the mat as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To you a great champion is the whole package of how you present yourself when you lose? How you represent yourself just off the mat?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the worst thing is when you get somebody that's a bit of an ass and they're not presenting themselves in the right way. So I like to see somebody presenting themselves in the right way. And I think that it's something that can be taught. It's something that normally comes with a little bit of experience and a little bit of age. I like to think that I'm a little bit different now than I was when I was 19. Not that I was bad, I just think I was just, I see it often now, just full of beans.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're a beautiful work in progress. What about Nomura, Tadahro Nomura, three-time gold medalist?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Never lost an Olympic fight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's something there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to participate in the Olympics because he lost the Japanese trials twice, in two Olympic possibilities. He had to qualify for Japan and then go to the Olympic Games and then do it there. Sometimes some of the best people in Japan can't get outside of Japan. Look at the situation they had with Abe and then they had Maruyama. Maruyama and Abe were both the best. By far. In the under-66 kilos category. This is for the last Olympic Games. And they sent one to the world Championships one to the Olympic Games and they both won gold medals.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, that's why the all Japan Championships is legendary, that there's these battles with Dimash and all of them.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Abe and Maruyama, they had trials in the Kodokan. It was 26 minutes, I think it was 26 minutes, it went.

What's that training like?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>devastated.

I had this thing in my head about 2 1/2 years, and then all of a sudden I'm not unbeatable and you go... I almost lost it, completely lost it. Just so fortunate, couple of things went my way and just came out, and I scraped and scratched my way to the final and won the final well, all right? But that was my best match, but I almost lost it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, what do you do with the fact that if you go to Japan and you're getting, you're saying danger, you're probably getting-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, the arm bar, right? They wanted to see how I did it from underneath or over the top, and they just created this event.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Studied the creature.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>in and to get the situation that we want and to get the attacking situation that we want. Because I remember I was teaching in America to some jiu-jitsu guys, and they were saying, \"Oh, we'd never give you our back.\" And I said, \"With judo rules, certain situations it happens that when we try and do throws where we're facing away from our opponent.\" So for example, seonages, if they fail, then the back is there and that's how we get the back. And it's a different situation than going on your back in the guard situation. Totally different.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, Travis Stevens, I don't know how familiar you are with his judo, but he's a really interesting example.

I mean, I do the commentary as well for the freestyle, and I will be at the Olympics for the freestyle and the Greco-Roman. And I love the freestyle, absolutely love it. But freestyle is freestyle. Judo is judo. I like to see people doing judo.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but there's a rhyme to the whole combat thing.

You get Iliadis, for example, he just adapted.

So you mentioned jiu-jitsu a little bit. What to you is an interesting difference between jiu-jitsu and judo that you've observed? Because you're one of the greatest ever on the ground in judo.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>different approach, different timescale to them, and they have a different way in. So [inaudible 01:45:57] ours comes from a standing position directly in, we've got a timescale on it so we have to, like the catch, I always talk about the catch. Because in judo terms, if you don't get the catch immediately, then the referee won't see the transition in. And also the continuation from plan A, B, C, D if something builds. So we have to build it and we have to build it quickly. And I think in jiu-jitsu terms, you have more time to build.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a kind of patience like, \"Oh, if this doesn't work out, I can try a different thing.\" With Judo, there's an urgency.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's an urgency.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a ref watching skeptically. So you better show that you're making progress.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You've got to show the progression. And that's why I always had a plan A, B, C. You see there with... That was 1981 there, the great Kashiwazaki had a progression. Everything was, he knew exactly where he had to be. It was feel. That wasn't by accident, it was trained. And I think that that transition there and taking control of somebody's mistake, so somebody might have made a mistake or not hit properly, or your defense has caused them to make a mistake and then you take advantage of it. And that is the difference.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the side effects of that, I don't know with the chicken or the egg, but judo people on the ground are much more aggressive. So probably because of the urgency, but there's an intention behind the progress you're making. I think jiu-jitsu is more relaxed. There's more a culture of just finding places to relax and think of different control and positions and take your time. And as a result, it's much, much less exhausting. So you can go for much longer. It feels like judo is exhausting.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and know when to go and when not to go. And I think also, I was going to ask you, you think it'd make a difference, I mean, certain jiu-jitsu, you can't just throw yourself on your back into the guard. You have to throw into the situation. You have got, I mean, I know Roger Gracie, he decided that he was going to learn judo. He saw the importance of being able to throw for the transition in, and so he came to the budokai and he was learning off Ray Stevens, and they were doing really a lot-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, he's a fascinating study because he does the most basic stuff and he does-<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Amazing, isn't it? But he has about a thousand ways in.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, yeah. I mean, and the thousand ways there's in the details, so it kind of might even look the same to people. But he finds a way to choke people. So he's on top of them, mounted in a sort of judo pin position, and everyone knows what's coming next against the best people in the world, and you should be able to defend it, but nobody can, it's crazy.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there's the power element as well, that you don't realize how when somebody's directed in a particular way, then you have that kind of element of absolute power that you can only feel, like when Roger's doing a technique, I think that you would only feel it if he did it on you, then you can feel it. It's not something that happens... So tricks is one thing, but actually being able to do something really well from a power point of view. Like you say, he only does those few things, but he does them really, really, really well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I don't know what that is about. Actually, judo pins is a very interesting case study as well, because people are able to feel so heavy. One of the things judoka are able to do is pin extremely well, and it makes you realize that it's not about the weight, it's about some kind of technique that makes people feel like they weigh a thousand pounds.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>what really interests me. I mean, I'm always looking, small ideas. I'm always looking at the jiu-jitsu and it fascinates me.

I would've absolutely loved it, but it wasn't as prominent then.

It's the neutralizer of size, and a lot of other components. It just blew people's mind. \"Oh, okay. It's not just about size. It's not just about big guys swinging hands. It's a lot of other components, and the groundwork is really, really important.\" And of course, there's a few judoka that succeeded in the UFC since then, which is always interesting how they adapt.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...and then just constantly adjusting the people.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>could I put him on his back? No, I was all on him and he'll tell you, but he just wouldn't go. He was going to be great, without a doubt. So I wanted everybody on with him, everybody. So everybody went on with him. And so it only improved their game and it improved him. And then small technical things that have stayed with him that we were doing with the Juji Gatame that was passed on to Kayla and then gone on to Ronda and it's all small things that I can see sometimes that it's passed on.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the Tai Otoshi? He said he learned a lot from you from that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And he does it differently.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And so I should mention that's one of the trickier throw... I mean, I still don't understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is a tricky throw.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't understand. So for people who don't know, boy, how would you even explain it? It doesn't make any sense. When you just look solo, the movement you make is quite simple, but how you get a person to be off balance, how you actually get them to be thrown. And when you do throw it successfully, it looks like a whipping motion that's effortless. It makes no sense.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and you're pulling somebody off balance, getting them moving, pulling them off balance. Tai otoshi means body drop. So it's basically two legs across your partner's body. I've got my back to you and I've already pulled you off balance with my hands, and then I'm going to just flex my legs up just as you are coming onto my back. And then you're going to go over if I coordinated all right. If it doesn't get coordinated right, then you're going to come right on my back and try to rip my arm off. So got get it right.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you can convert it into words, some secret ingredients that allowed you to pull it off at the highest levels, the Tai otoshi?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wrong because their partner's not reacting in the right way. So half of it is to get the person to react as they should. So if I was doing it with you, you and I, first thing I'd teach you to do is to react the way I want you to react. And then I'd react the way that you want me to react. So then we'd have success with it rather than you leaning back in the wrong way or resisting or frightened going over. So actually, that's why nine times out of 10, people get the technique wrong.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's actually fascinating to me because in the United States where I came up, I mean, the level of judo is not comparable to the level of judo in the rest of the world. Of course the Pedro Center is an exception to that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Certain athletes, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just certain athletes. When I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, even the 16 year old kids are just all deadly, so it was terrifying. But I remember the Russian national team came through Philadelphia and one of the things that really impressed me is just how much easier judo was, training judo with them. They moved correctly. As the people getting thrown, every aspect of their body movement was correct in terms of it felt right to be throwing them, to be training with them. Everything about the gripping, about the position of their hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun. It was easy. And I always felt like I was learning. So I think all of that is loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you're developing through the throws, you're developing the right technique.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You got to develop. You have to develop between... I always had training partners that I trained with up to each Olympic games, we did the skills together and then we worked together in order to make techniques work. And we got it moving as quickly as we could. And one of the worst things that I see is, and I see a lot of YouTube stuff with them, coaches-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Here we go, got Neil Adams upset.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Don't even start me on that. Don't even start me on that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What you-<|eot_id|>"}

No, I'm actually laughing because I'm enjoying you talking trash. But you're talking about technique.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, well then the coaches and their clipboard guys with the clipboards and the stopwatches and they've got these kids running up and down the mat and then doing Uchikomi of something that's technically incorrect 10 times and then running up and doing another 10 at the other side and actually mixing everything together. And it's just a mess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Technique is important.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Technical mess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That said, some of it is conditioning type stuff that you were doing. So what is the hardest type of physical conditioning you were doing?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Probably ran too much when I was a kid. If I could go back now, I wouldn't run as much. And I ran hard and I ran strong. And I remember doing London Marathon one time and I said, \"I'm never going to do it again.\" I said, \"Never.\" But I ran and the problem was when I did the London Marathon is I was trying to beat three hours.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's that desire to win again.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's totally insane. It was insane. And I went out through half marathon in what I thought was a good time.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I went out too fast.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then you just-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I died.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>...wanted to keep going.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>over the bridge and I had to get there. It was the longest bridge I've ever, ever walked over and I walk, run. So I got over the bridge and I took one step over the line like that, and there was a guy over there and he was trying to rush everybody through. And he was going, \"Come on, come on, come on. There's people behind you?\" \"Get your hands off of me.\" I said, \"Get your hands off me now,\" like that because we're going to fall out. And I couldn't move. I couldn't move. I was white.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's amazing that you made it to the finish line though.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I did. I got over there and Donald Duck passing me was a tell.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, there's a person dressed as Donald Duck?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Donald Duck, yeah. But the thing was, I still crossed over 338. I crossed over 338, but I lost 38 minutes in the last four miles.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that bridge, longest bridge ever.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The longest.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you regret the running, huh?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So anyway, I would do the running a little bit differently, but we ran hard. We did the weight training, we did good weight training. It was all conditioned. So I mean, it was never the same training all the time. So it was always, we'd have certain phases building up. It was scientifically done. It wasn't just out there, run, weight training, judo, same judo all the time. It was always pretty scientific.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Good variety.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It was a good variety. And it had build up and it had a speed phase and it had a power phase and it had a base condition.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What about the Randori? Was there a method to the madness there? How much Randori did you do?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>A lot. So the most important thing for me, I mean, I see now that there's a lot of people out there that are not getting enough Randori. They're not Randori-ing enough. And there's a lot of sports science people and they're running and they're weight training and they're doing it all to death. And there's not enough judo. You have a look at some of the eastern block countries that are getting together, they're having these mass camps and the Japanese, they have just massive people that they can do there. They're doing probably 50-60 Randori's a week.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wait, what?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>50 or 60 a week.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>The average person is getting together... I mean, when I was doing Randori's, when I went to Japan, it was just purely for 60 Randori's a week.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How much is each one? How long is it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So they were five minutes then, they're four minutes now.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's a lot, especially given the level of the competition there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you can do it in Japan because it's fairly light. If they throw you, they throw you, you throw them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So there's a level of you're moving at a close to 100%, but the actual power in the force is not quite there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Different in Korea. Korea was harder, it was more physical. So you couldn't do 50 Randori's in Korea. You'd die. So you'd do 30.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>50 Randori's, wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you need the Randori. And so I chased the Randorers, so I chased them into training camps, I chased them all over my country. So I was getting 40 to 50 a week in my club. And then I would go to training camps and add more. And I honestly don't think that they do enough now, a lot of countries.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Somebody who doesn't know Randori's live training.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, sparring.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Was there a few people you remember that were just really tough to go against? You mentioned Goldtooth, is there others like it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Goldtooth was pretty horrific.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, you got him in the end.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I got him in the end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I suppose I should say not just tough, but just good training partners that you like.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and he'd ask me to practice and he'd finish the practice and you know that he would always say, \"Another one, we'll do another one.\" So you'd go, \"Oh yeah,\" because you had to make out that you weren't that bothered that you had to do another one, so you'd do another one back to back. And then he'd go sometimes, \"Let's do another one.\" So we'd end up doing 15 minutes with the same guy who could possibly throw you at any time. And that was hard. But I remember those particular guys and there were plenty of those.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you do with the exhaustion that you're feeling in those? How deep did you go in terms of-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You have to dig deep. And I think that that was the great thing about having certain European training camps were more physical. So I remember that we would have European training camps where you'd fight Germans and then the Dutch and then the French and then the Russian. You'd have all sorts different styles and people to fight and that was something then you'd have to dig in at a different place, come out of there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where do you go mentally? How many times have you gone there where you're really in deep waters exhaustion wise in competition, actually?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>were solid, absolutely solid and they had lactic acid in them. And I remember I stood on the rostrum and they were giving me things and I couldn't grip them properly. So I was saying, \"Put it under my armpit or chin,\" like that, trying to hold this and I couldn't hold anything. So there are times when I really had to go really deep. I remember fighting two East Germans the same day, one of the competitions and the number one and the number two East Germans, and that was another day where I had to really dig deep.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's the fascinating thing about some of these tournaments is if you go full distance on several matches in a row, what you're seeing in the finals are two people that have fought a lot that day.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>are going into golden score and they've done one contest in four minutes and then they go another four minutes. And then we've had some go into a third four minutes, this is all back to back. It might be in the first round, it might be in the final. And we've got some now that are coming out and you can see the stats and the ones that win in golden score. So we got Japanese, Hashimoto, he's the Japanese representative now instead of Ono, because Ono's finished. So Hashimoto's coming out. He was in a tournament last week.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is he a good one to look up?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, just have a look at him. So Hashimoto's in white here and there's a great example there. Well, I'm glad we got onto that. So I mean, he has got great technique, Hashimoto.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Effortless, effortless. Pay attention as we're talking. Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Right, so you can see exactly what we're talking about there, great timing. And again, sometimes he backs them up to the edge and then he'll wait for them to come back in towards, they don't want to step out to get a penalty.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I guess that's a cross grip Tai otoshi or did I see that wrong?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, cross grip, different grips. Oh, great examples there. Just what we were talking about.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Making it look so easy. Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So he's going to be their representative at 73 kilograms. Look at him, back him up again and again, just catching him as he pushes back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So push, push, push, and then-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, action, reaction at it's best there. And slight change of direction. He sometimes goes down onto his knee there, which is seoi otoshi. It turns from Tai otoshi, which is springing up, to seoi otoshi that's going down.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh, the title of the video is, Tai Otoshi is a Work of Art.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>This is him at his best, showing him doing what he does best. But he had to go three times into golden score last week and dig deep and lost one of them, I think.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But you're still going at it. You're talking about all those training sessions. Niki, your wonderful wife, told me that you were going all over from Target to Target looking for workout clothes because your luggage got lost because you had to get a workout in.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>You know what? I realized that if I'm a miserable git, then she'll get me into the gym. And the thing is that I'm better if I get in there for an hour and I just do something, at least 35-40 minutes cardio. And then I do some weights and more high repetitions. It's not so much heavy weights now, but more functional stuff.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean, you travel all over the world for the commentary of these competitions. So is it sometimes a challenge to figure out how-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>work out. So most of the hotels that we were in were high-rise hotels. So we were in the steps, we were doing the steps right the way up. So I started it, and so I started off with me going up and then one or two of the others and the referees started to go up with me. So in the end, we'd have this trail of people going up the steps and down. And every place we went to, we had the steps. So that was an interesting situation. So we were sick of steps in the end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What advice would you give to beginners, people starting out in judo, how to develop their game, how to find the beauty in the sport and the art of judo?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>that if you look at 90% of the people that practice martial arts are doing it for pleasure. So they want to get pleasure. So you need a club that's got a bit of a mixture. They've got a direction to go into competition if they want, and then the rest, it's for fun and to enjoy it, but with really good instruction because with really good instruction and a good foundation and a good base, you get more enjoyment because you have more success. Let's be honest, the more success we have with something, the more we like it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and great technique is a way to really discover the beauty of the art. And so great teaching is really important there.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Great teaching is so important.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What does it take to get from the early days when you started judo to world-class level?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And I think it happened, one of the French, she went to the Olympic games in 2012 and she'd been doing judo for eight years, but then she started to lose. So she had a relative success early on. The Olympics was one of them. She got a silver medal, but then she went off the boil and then she came back and now she's still competing and she's been there for well over 13 years at the very top. So I think that any foundation, it's like anything, if you lay a really solid foundation, it generally lasts longer.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, but that foundation again, is that technique or what does it take to build that foundation?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I think technique, you get away with murder. With technique, you can get away with having bad condition, but I mean, you get found out in the end. But you can go out and you can win certain things by doing really nice technique. But I think if you've got the mixture, if you've got the whole package, then you can go the whole way.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So for people who somehow don't know some of the greatest judo matches ever.

What are some good memories that pop to your head?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>amazing because the crowd, they're there, they're on the mat, they're all judoka, they're well-educated to the sport. Every time somebody twitches, they're very biased towards their own, which you expect, but sometimes I haven't been able to hear myself speak, and that's very unusual. You've got the headphones on and you're blocked out. Sometimes Teddy Riner's been walking out there and the crowd are going crazy and they're on their feet when somebody twitches and then you get the crowd silences. We had one of those last week.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Silence, nothing like that.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Massive. And there's always surprises. Paris is great.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it's fascinating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It changes the dynamics of the whole thing.
