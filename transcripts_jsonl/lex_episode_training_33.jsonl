The following is a conversation with Neil Adams, a legend in the sport of judo. He is a world champion, two-time Olympic silver medalist, five-time European champion, and often referred to as the voice of judo commentating all the major events, world championships and Olympic Games. Highlighting the drama, the triumph, the artistry of the sport of judo. Making fans like me feel the biggest wins, the biggest losses, the surprise turns of fortune, the dominance of champions coming to an end and new champions made. Always speaking from the heart. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neil Adams. You are a five-time European champion, world champion two-time Olympic silver medalist. Let's first go to the 1980 Olympics. Where was your mind? What was your preparation like? What was your strategy leading into that Olympics?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>below because I was seeded in the top four. And as it happens, I think it was probably the worst decision I made. Well because...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well...<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Simply because, I mean, it was the only contest that I lost was the final of the Olympic Games in that year.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you're a young kid, what? Like 19-20 at that time full of confidence, vigor. So the decision to cut weight, how hard was it for you to cut weight to the 71 kg division?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>fact that I was fighting somebody was terrific. He was an excellent, brilliant athlete, but definitely didn't help that my nutrition was not very good.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, so you lost to Ezio Gamba. There's probably a lot of that we could say about that particular match. Maybe let's zoom in. What were your strengths and weaknesses, judo-wise in that Olympics? You said you haven't really lost the match, you won the European Championship leading into it, but if you had weak spots, okay, you already said diet, but specifically on the mat in terms of judo.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>think that none of the fights lasted time going into the final. So I won fairly quickly and every match by ippon way before time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember how you won the matches?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>of throws for ippon and then an armlock for ippon. Semi-final was an armlock against the East German Kruger. And yeah, I was flying through.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What were the throws? Do you remember?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was a Juji-Gatame roll. Against an East German who I'd beaten before but always had a really tough match, but managed to beat him well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you had a beautiful exhibition of Japanese-type Judo in the first two matches. You threw people and then you also did the [inaudible 00:06:43], unbarred a person. Great. So going into the final, what are the weaknesses going into the final against the Italian?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>wasn't good for me. That was definite no, I hated fighting leftys, still do, but I'll tell you why in a minute. I just did...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That's great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>rescue a dying match, and I was kind of one step, half a step behind all the way through. So never really got into it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So why do you hate fighting leftys? And leftys are, we should say, overrepresented in terms of the higher ranks of Judo. I don't know why that is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>to dominate the grips, but the actual angle of the opponent wasn't what I wanted, so I had to work hard, really hard against it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What happened in that match?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>and four years later at the Olympics, I was silver medalist at the Olympics four years later as well. And yeah, it still haunts me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you sometimes wake up and think like, \"Eh, I should have eaten better\" or maybe a specific grip that you're like, \"Ah, I shouldn't have taken that grip.\"?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you would think that most people have got it sorted, but there's still people making mistakes and still people that haven't got it totally sorted.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And then there's people like Travis Stevens who I think doesn't care. He'll just have atrocious nutrition and he just makes it work. I think the way he spoke about it is you can't always control nutrition, so it's best to get good at having crappy nutrition.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>That's a good way of looking at it. I never, yeah, maybe that's what I did.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Exactly, exactly. Do you remember what you were eating? Are we talking about candy or?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>advance. I was a good trainer and I trained more than most. I can honestly say that. It probably got me away with a lot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Where was your mind? So mental preparation going into that Olympics, you said you were confident, but is there some preparation aspect behind that confidence?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>many. And my attitude was that I wasn't going to lose and couldn't lose. So I was always surprised when I did, when something happened.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In Neil Adams, A Life in Judo, written in 1986. You wrote, \"Ever since I can remember I have wanted to win. It wasn't the ordinary feeling that children have when they take part in their first primary school sack race on a grass track or even the keen determination of a young swimmer prepared to train early in the cold winter mornings in order to make it into the county side. With me, the desire to win was and still is as much a part of me as my arms and legs. In other words, it wasn't something I learned as I grew older, but rather it was deeply rooted in me. Perhaps this competitive instinct is the greatest difference between my public image and the view from the inside.\" So people see the kindness, the warmth you have the charisma of the excitement, but there's this big drive to win inside you. So what's behind that? Can you just speak to that, that drive to win and how that contributed to your career?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Do you know when I look back now...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is a lot of years ago, we should say.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It is a lot of years ago.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Is that true or were you just being poetic?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>doing, it's still that will to win. And I'm much better at masking it now if I don't. But it still bothers me as much.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're talking about like... I don't know, even just stupid, silly things. Like I don't know, a game of pool or something like this or just anything.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I was going to be... It's not a good thing when you getting older and you've still got the same competitive mind, but things change.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So it's still there. You get on the mat probably even now, right? You get on the mat with a world champion, you still the current world champion, there's still a little part of you. Could I still toss this guy?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>But you know...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Kids these days are soft.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Iliadis. He is a monster, right? And of course you couldn't because just at sixty-something you couldn't, but you like to think that you could.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You could, you never know. You got to find out.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>know what you would do. What you can do is you can cause them problems and they feel it immediately. But you'd last a minute.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you've trained with Ilias Iliadis, I've gotten a chance to train with him as well. He's a really nice guy, really great.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>training and the different things watching these two mad men doing... I'm glad we weren't on a mat at that particular time. But good fun.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>What do you think about that guy? He like you achieved a lot of success when he was young.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>pulled Nevzorov, I fought Nevzorov and I had him really worried because he expected without a doubt, to come out, throw this kid and junior.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he was thick and shredded. [inaudible 00:17:36] he's a man.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's a picture of him in his judogi and his judogi is just cut and he looks the business. And there's me in this baggy...<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Skinny kid.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>was a massive step forward because year later I was starting to fill out and two years later I was competing for the Olympic title.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I don't know if I remember, but Ilias Iliadis is interesting because even at 17 I feel like he was doing big throws, like literally lifting them with the hips.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>ground. I mean it's just different style of judo and it just looks different. But now they're starting to do traditional style judo as well.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So can you speak to that? What are the different styles of judo? So for you, you mentioned uchi mata, tai otoshi, these... How would you describe them? They're like these effortless, less lifting off the ground and power and strength and more timing and position, movement, momentum, all this kind of stuff. That's more traditionally associated with Japanese judo because for Japanese judo, the traditional judo, you're supposed to throw people in a big way without much effort.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It looks like wrestling with judo, with judo jackets on. \"So you either change it or we are going to take one of you out.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By the way, we should sort of clarify when we say people are bent over, that's usually how you see freestyle wrestling. Wrestlers are more bent over to defend the legs and so on. And traditional judo people are more standing up because that's the position for which you can do the big throws and all that kind of stuff. But I think the other case to make for banding leg grabs is a lot of people are using it for stalling and not for beautiful big throws and all that kind of stuff. So it's not just to make it different from wrestling, it is also like you want to maximize the amount of epic throws and dynamic judo and exciting stuff to watch, right?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>target. And then also I use my hips. So again, it's a form of judo that was being lost. So now we've got it back.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So let's go there. Let's speak about judo as if we're talking to a group of five-year-olds. So what is judo? What are some defining characteristics of judo as a sport, as a way, as a martial arts, a way of life, all that kind of stuff?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>old churches because when I go into an old church, it doesn't matter what the religion within the church, but there's a reverence in there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Reverence is a good word. It feels like a really special place no matter which dojo you go to, it's just you bow and there's a calmness before the storm of battle or whatever it is.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and respect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, respect.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>she did put it right and now she's back up there and she won the world title back. So these are great champions for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, I mean that's the right way to see it. But it's also tragic to lose the Olympic Games.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Twice. Yes, it is tragic. And I do have sleepless nights.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I mean that's the magic of the Olympic Games. Anything can happen. And your 1980 Olympics were very different from 1984, but if we just linger on '80 and just what we're talking about, how much you wanted to win, do you love winning or hate losing more?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>title the year later, and I had no doubt when I went into that day that I was going to be world champion. No doubt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So you won the '81 World Championship.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>At the higher weight.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>At the 78.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Kg. Actually, can we go there? What was going through your mind? You ended up arm barring a Japanese fighter. I talked to Jimmy Pedro, a friend of yours, somebody who said you were a mentor to him for many years, and he told me a bunch of different questions to ask you, but he said that was a really special time. That was a really special dominant run you had, and especially finishing with an arm bar against a Japanese player. So take me through that. What do you remember from that?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Renair is one of those, he puts it out there and he keeps beating them so they can't take it away from them. It's fantastic.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So stepping on the mat, every single encounter you're trying to win, you're looking for the grips with the intention to throw big, even when you're ahead on points and all that kind of stuff.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>it's really difficult. But when I was coaching, I was trying to always encourage that positive attitude for the full four minutes, five minutes then.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've competed a lot in judo and jiu-jitsu. I've always hated that part of myself. When I'm up on points by a lot, you look at the clock and it's what you do when you look at the clock, it's a minute and a half, you're really tired and you quit. You just defend. And I hated that part about myself. It's like that-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's saying don't do it. Yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Well as opposed to, in judo for a big throw, just keep going For the throw. In jiu-jitsu, it's go for the submission, win in the real way, versus on points. I hated that part of myself. Mostly underneath that is cowardice induced by exhaustion.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>out. So he got penalized, lost the match and lost all of the points for qualification. So that's paying high price. That's paying high price.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. There's a thin line between triumph and tragedy in those competitions. But especially at the Olympic games. So let's just stick on '81 World Championship. What did it feel like to win that world championship. And also getting an arm bar as a Japanese player? Jamie told me your arms were exhausted.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>go all out for this? There has been occasions when I've released it, just if I've got a minute to go and just block out.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Correct. So what you're saying on the feet, there is a change of direction of all different kinds of attempts and then you went to the ground. Do you remember that decision of like, okay, am I going to finish this?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>soon as I climbed his back and then I thought he's not going. I'm not going to let him up. So I was just changing-<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Little voice in your head.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>always about pressure on the arm. And of course he was like that, defending. He was almost total bridge trying to get out of it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did it start in turtle and did you flip?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the attack and then he went on to his front. And then I was on his back. And then I started the whole [inaudible 00:34:41].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Saw the opening. You just went for it?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>you've got to make sure that you're in. And so I was just on his back like a leech and I never let him go.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's where the arm bars, that's where the attacks on the ground, which is called newaza, happens is in the transition. At that level, at that high world-class level?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>mug. He was strong. And I'd fought him once before and I knew he was a lefty as well, which was really awkward for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Did it feel good?<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>going to be world champion. I'm going to be the best in the world.\" I had no idea how difficult that was going to be.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well there's wisdom to that. There's power and stupidity of youth.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I like that. It is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah. Just I'm going to be a world champ. I'm going to win this without knowing how hard it is. And then once you go after it, you're trapped. You're going to have to do the work.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>there are different levels. Majority of people are just not informed as to what's out there and the different levels that there are out there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Do you remember a certain opponent that for the first time you felt like, \"Holy shit.\" Somebody just gripped you up and you're like, \"There's another level to this game.\"<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>the European championships. I beat two times, and then lost him in the Olympic games two months after I'd beaten him in the European championship.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Oh wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Yeah. So that made it even more difficult.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that's literally your nemesis there. Wow.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>turning, like that you'd be stretched out. And I thought, \"I want to do this.\" And then I ended up fighting him again in Japan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So that feeling of danger is really interesting. I've did randori with a lot of world-class people from different parts of the world including Ilias Iliadis. And there's certain parts, like Eastern European judo, you feel like you're screwed the whole way through. The gripping. You really feel it in the gripping.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's the gripping that does it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>But with really good Japanese style, judoka, it's a terrifying calmness, or at least the experiences that I've had. You don't really feel it in the gripping, you just feel like anywhere you step you're getting thrown. It's a different-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's a different thing, isn't it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a different thing.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>arm over your back, all right. And you know you're going to go up and over. You know you're going to go over. That's it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's a cool feeling. It's like whenever-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Not for me.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I understand. Because it feels way more powerful than it should. It's weird. I don't know. You want to attribute it to strength and all that kind of stuff. People say you have immense upper body strength, but it's probably something else. It's technique. It's some kind of weird-<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>It's mix of everything.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Just something hardened through lots of battles and randori and that kind of stuff. But it's cool that humans are able to generate that kind of power. It's cool.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>a massive difference. Huge difference to something. And people think it's just the jacket that we're wearing, but it isn't. It's our only tool actually.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, and it's a way of establishing control over another body. And it's a whole art form and a science. And I don't even know if you understand it really. You understand it subconsciously through time, because there's so much involved. Because pulling on one part of the jacket pulls other parts of the jacket and the physics of that is probably insane to understand.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>skillful as well. And he's got that mentality of a winner. He has got that mentality of a winner there. He just wins important matches.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And he goes over the top of the grip. Where's that land now in terms of rules over the top?

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>So we have to build it and we have to build it quickly. And I think in jiu-jitsu terms, you have more time to build.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, there's a kind of patience like, \"Oh, if this doesn't work out, I can try a different thing.\" With Judo, there's an urgency.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>There's an urgency.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>And there's a ref watching skeptically. So you better show that you're making progress.<|eot_id|>"}

And that is the difference.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So one of the side effects of that, I don't know with the chicken or the egg, but judo people on the ground are much more aggressive. So probably because of the urgency, but there's an intention behind the progress you're making. I think jiu-jitsu is more relaxed. There's more a culture of just finding places to relax and think of different control and positions and take your time. And as a result, it's much, much less exhausting. So you can go for much longer. It feels like judo is exhausting.<|eot_id|>"}

Actually, judo pins is a very interesting case study as well, because people are able to feel so heavy.

Yeah, it was the key, wasn't it?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yeah, it was a big missing link in our conception of fighting. It's the neutralizer of size, and a lot of other components. It just blew people's mind. \"Oh, okay. It's not just about size. It's not just about big guys swinging hands. It's a lot of other components, and the groundwork is really, really important.\" And of course, there's a few judoka that succeeded in the UFC since then, which is always interesting how they adapt.

Of course the Pedro Center is an exception to that.<|eot_id|>"}
{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Certain athletes, yeah.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It's just certain athletes. When I trained recently with Jimmy Pedro, even the 16 year old kids are just all deadly, so it was terrifying. But I remember the Russian national team came through Philadelphia and one of the things that really impressed me is just how much easier judo was, training judo with them. They moved correctly. As the people getting thrown, every aspect of their body movement was correct in terms of it felt right to be throwing them, to be training with them. Everything about the gripping, about the position of their hips, about the shoulder, everything. It was fun. It was easy. And I always felt like I was learning. So I think all of that is loaded in, I guess, into proper training. So you're developing through the throws, you're developing the right technique.<|eot_id|>"}

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And then I would go to training camps and add more.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>he does best.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>least 35-40 minutes cardio. And then I do some weights and more high repetitions.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>And every place we went to, we had the steps. So that was an interesting situation.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>years at the very top.

{"text": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>doing really nice technique.
